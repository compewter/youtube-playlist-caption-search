<p t="12280" d="2060">I don't know if any other personality course</p>
<p t="14340" d="3900">in North America talks about Binswanger and Boss anymore maybe not</p>
<p t="18240" d="4075">But I think their ideas are extremely interesting</p>
<p t="22320" d="3080">And so I'm going to talk about them</p>
<p t="25900" d="3680">They were influenced very much by Martin Heidegger</p>
<p t="29740" d="3960">Who was one of the 20th century's greatest philosophers</p>
<p t="33700" d="4500">I would say probably - This school of</p>
<p t="38200" d="1980">This part of the phenomenological school</p>
<p t="40300" d="3160">was more influenced directly by a philosopher than any other school.</p>
<p t="43460" d="3460">And just to reiterate because you might keep wondering why</p>
<p t="48880" d="2400">I discuss so many philosophers in this course</p>
<p t="51280" d="1560">It's because</p>
<p t="54140" d="5620">Clinical Psychology in particular is not strictly a scientific enterprise</p>
<p t="59940" d="4900">It's because it's oriented towards values as far as I can tell</p>
<p t="65000" d="2720">And I don't see that there is any way of getting around that</p>
<p t="68100" d="2840">and that because what you are trying to do as a clinical psychologist</p>
<p t="71260" d="3920">and perhaps what you're trying to do with your own life  is to figure out how to live properly</p>
<p t="75480" d="2900">Now you can construe that as the absence of illness</p>
<p t="78500" d="5980">Which is - That's about as close as you get to a scientific model of living well</p>
<p t="84540" d="1500">So you don't have any illnesses</p>
<p t="86180" d="4200">But even the idea of illness is an idea that's not precisely scientific</p>
<p t="90860" d="3740">It's an amalgam of scientific concepts and ethical concepts</p>
<p t="95280" d="500">so</p>
<p t="96540" d="4180">There is no escaping it and if you're in the domain of ethics or values</p>
<p t="100840" d="2600">Then you're in what is more or less a philosophical domain</p>
<p t="103840" d="5155">But also if you're a scientist - if you're a scientist who is interested in personality</p>
<p t="109000" d="2640">It's also something you have to grapple with conceptually</p>
<p t="111780" d="3940">Because people live within an ethic and the ethic structures their perceptions</p>
<p t="115800" d="2680">And so even to study human beings as objects</p>
<p t="118480" d="4560">You still have to take into account they ensconce themselves within a value system</p>
<p t="123100" d="1740">and you have to understand what that means</p>
<p t="125120" d="4780">So for me it's easier and more straightforward just to get right to the root of matter to begin with</p>
<p t="130020" d="2560">and these people also had insanely interesting ideas</p>
<p t="132700" d="1700">They're really useful to know</p>
<p t="134580" d="2420">And so this, I would say maybe these</p>
<p t="137060" d="4155">The philosophy that underpins this might be the most complex of all the philosophies</p>
<p t="141220" d="2940">That we're going to discuss</p>
<p t="145380" d="3640">And that's really saying something because there is no shortage of complexities say in Jung</p>
<p t="149100" d="5200">And it's very difficult to portray what these people were up to</p>
<p t="154900" d="3780">I started by telling you, when we discussed Rogers a little bit</p>
<p t="158680" d="9100">That the phenomenologists were interested in the fact that people live within a self-defined perceptual world</p>
<p t="167960" d="2080">That might be one way of thinking about it</p>
<p t="172500" d="5580">Part of the way to start to conceptualize what that means is to consider for a moment</p>
<p t="178320" d="4520">just consider for a moment how many things there are in this room that you might look at</p>
<p t="183040" d="3360">and the answer to that is there's an infinite number of them</p>
<p t="186400" d="2300">Depending on how you're going to scale your perceptions</p>
<p t="188860" d="4755">You could spend, if you were a painter, you could spend a month painting that tile</p>
<p t="193620" d="3880">Painting a representation of that tile because it's infinitely complex</p>
<p t="197640" d="4160">To get the colors right, to get the patterns right, there's no end to it really</p>
<p t="201920" d="2580">Because to make a representation that was accurate</p>
<p t="204660" d="4360">It would have to be as detailed as the thing itself and it's crazily detailed</p>
<p t="209020" d="1740">But you don't concentrate on that sort of thing</p>
<p t="210780" d="4800">So you think, you're surrounded by an infinite number of potential things to apprehend</p>
<p t="215800" d="1435">But that isn't the world you live in</p>
<p t="217240" d="5340">The world you live in is a very very constrained subset of those things</p>
<p t="222720" d="3920">And part of the question is then: what's the nature of that constrained subset</p>
<p t="226640" d="3240">That's what you inhabit that's what makes up your experience</p>
<p t="229980" d="5620">And also how is it related to the infinitely complex objects that are around you</p>
<p t="235800" d="2560">And that's really what these people were trying to figure out.</p>
<p t="238360" d="3680">So you're in this perceptual frame, that's one way of thinking about it.</p>
<p t="242040" d="1980">That's the Dasein, by the way</p>
<p t="244020" d="4120">That's the existential frame or the phenomenological frame</p>
<p t="248140" d="2200">Because you can't think about it merely as perception</p>
<p t="250560" d="4100">Because it contains also, all of the things you experience subjectively</p>
<p t="254860" d="3280">The emotions and the Qualia that</p>
<p t="258240" d="3440">You know Qualia is an element of being</p>
<p t="261700" d="4480">that say philosophers or scientists of consciouness have a particularly difficult time with.</p>
<p t="266360" d="4520">And it's like - it's the quality of pain which doesn't seem reducible to a set of  objective facts</p>
<p t="270940" d="5060">Or the quality of color, or the quality of beauty, or the quality of love, or the quality of sorrow</p>
<p t="276200" d="3200">Those things seem irreducible to some degree in and of themselves</p>
<p t="279620" d="3800">Like what is pain made of? It doesn't even seem like a reasonable question.</p>
<p t="283420" d="7720">I mean you can say, how do you decompose the neurological circuits that are involved in the experience of pain? Fine.</p>
<p t="291300" d="5900">But to ask what pain consists of or is composed of or what beauty is composed of, or love.</p>
<p t="297200" d="4560">Seems to be -  There is something wrong with the formulation of that question</p>
<p t="301760" d="4320">Because those things sort of manifest them self as raw facts of existence</p>
<p t="306420" d="4240">And so they're constituent elements of this - of your field of experience</p>
<p t="310860" d="3640">Your phenomenological frame or this Dasein</p>
<p t="314540" d="3580">Which is the way that Heidegger conceptualized it.</p>
<p t="318380" d="7320">That's being there with you at the center of your what? Your realm of experience</p>
<p t="325880" d="1060"> </p>
<p t="328100" d="3460">Now here's some characteristics of the Dasein</p>
<p t="331760" d="2860">The thing that makes up you</p>
<p t="334945" d="2570">The past and the present are implicit in it</p>
<p t="337720" d="1700">What does that mean?</p>
<p t="339600" d="6280">Well, say you have a particular emotional response to something, maybe it's a negative emotional response.</p>
<p t="346060" d="2800">And you see this very frequently with arguments with people</p>
<p t="349000" d="3500">You're having an argument with someone you love. Like a family member, that's a good example</p>
<p t="352680" d="3860">So lets say it's the same damn fight you've had with your mother 50 times</p>
<p t="357300" d="2880">Okay that's interesting because what it means is that</p>
<p t="360360" d="5120">All of those 50 times you've fought with your mother are implicit in this fight</p>
<p t="365640" d="4360">So althought it's taking place right here and now, the past has shaped it</p>
<p t="370180" d="3820">And if you wanted to investigate the fight completely</p>
<p t="374120" d="4020">You'd have to get to the bottom of that entire train of interactions you've had with your mother</p>
<p t="378220" d="6560">So it's implicit in your current experience that's one way of thinking about it</p>
<p t="384920" d="2020">But the future is implicit in it too because</p>
<p t="387400" d="6860">What you're doing right now, it's as if the future is folded up in what you're experiencing right now and it unfolds as you interact with it</p>
<p t="394440" d="5660">And so the reason it's conditional to some degree on you and your past is because</p>
<p t="400460" d="7280">it's your past and you that are determining the actions that you undertake right now that determine how the future is going to unfold around you</p>
<p t="407840" d="5880">Now not completely obviously because you don't have complete control over how things unfold</p>
<p t="414060" d="5140">But you seem to have some ability to determine how things unfold</p>
<p t="419800" d="4280">So one of the ways I've sort of conceptualized the phenomenological viewpoint</p>
<p t="424180" d="2720">This is one way of thinking about it I believe is that</p>
<p t="426940" d="5620">Instead of thinking - It does mean you have to reconceptualize your idea of objects</p>
<p t="432700" d="3520">Like an object seems like a unidimensional thing in some sense. It's an object.</p>
<p t="436360" d="3315">But most of the things people interact with aren't like that at all</p>
<p t="439675" d="1900">So like here's an example</p>
<p t="442120" d="1720">Let's say you have</p>
<p t="444080" d="2080">Let's say you get</p>
<p t="446360" d="2120">You're writing the MCAT, you want to go to medical school</p>
<p t="448580" d="4220">You've written the MCAT, you get the envelope in the mail, it tells you what your score is</p>
<p t="452920" d="2840">You hold the envelope, what are you holding?</p>
<p t="456060" d="2860">Well if you think about it from an objective perspective, it's an envelope</p>
<p t="458920" d="2540">Who cares? It's just a little piece of paper right?</p>
<p t="461620" d="2300">It's a rectangle of paper</p>
<p t="464100" d="1920">But that isn't what you're holding at all</p>
<p t="466380" d="6880">That's not what that thing is, that's how you see it. But it's not what it is at all and you know that. Your body knows that</p>
<p t="473400" d="3480">Because you're shaking. Well, what are you scared of? The envelope?</p>
<p t="477040" d="7740">Well the fact that you see it as an envelope is only an indication of just how narrow your perceptions actually are.</p>
<p t="485060" d="2100">Because it's a portal.</p>
<p t="487160" d="4300">Right? it's a portal through which you are going to walk into one of two worlds</p>
<p t="491620" d="3280">One in which you're in medical school and the other in which you're not</p>
<p t="495040" d="2720">And it also actually contains the past</p>
<p t="497800" d="5140">Which is really strange because you think, well you already know what the past is. No you don't.</p>
<p t="502940" d="5240">Whatever that score is in there determines what your past was and you know that too.</p>
<p t="508320" d="5200">You go watch a movie and a bunch of things happen in the movie and then something twisted happens at the end  and all the sudden (trilling)</p>
<p t="513640" d="2780">Everything that you thought about the movie was wrong</p>
<p t="516720" d="2740">and a whole new past for the movie pops into being</p>
<p t="519980" d="7440">Well, are you a pre-med student? A valid pre-med student? Well the score will determine whether or not you were.</p>
<p t="527420" d="1880">Very strange, very strange</p>
<p t="529380" d="1520">Because you think of the past as fixed</p>
<p t="531180" d="5660">You know? And you think of the things you're interacting with as the things that you see and they're not</p>
<p t="537180" d="4860">And you're body is smarter than that, way smarter than that. Because it responds to, you could say</p>
<p t="542140" d="7260">And this is sort of a Rogerian perspective, your body is more likely to respond to what the thing actually is, than how it is that you see it.</p>
<p t="549720" d="4160">Okay so, the past is implicit in the current being</p>
<p t="553920" d="2640">and the future is implicit in the current being</p>
<p t="556760" d="3320">And so the past and the future sort of folded up inside it</p>
<p t="560180" d="2640">And you can unfold them and take a look at them</p>
<p t="569660" d="1700">Now, here's the next thing</p>
<p t="571500" d="3640">So, from a classic scientific perspective,</p>
<p t="575140" d="4120">There's the world of independently existing objects and there's the world of subjects</p>
<p t="579320" d="4760">And the subject is really in a secondary relationship to the object</p>
<p t="584080" d="1840">Because the objective world is what's real</p>
<p t="585920" d="4940">But one of the things that the phenomenologists were concerned about that</p>
<p t="591020" d="6380">Is that, well you run into this problem again of exactly how it is that you define the object</p>
<p t="597400" d="8900">Because, just as the envelope with the scores in it can't be reduced to the paper,</p>
<p t="606740" d="7540">So the object that you're interacting with only reveals what it is as a consequence of the way that you interact with it</p>
<p t="614280" d="4320">So for example if you take a complex object like another person</p>
<p t="618660" d="6100">It's like well, what is it that you are. Well a huge part of that is going to depend on exactly how I interact with you</p>
<p t="624880" d="3800">Because you could be a raging beast if I interacted with you one way</p>
<p t="628700" d="6760">and you could be a perfectly, you know, cooperative entity that was very pleasant if I interacted with you another way</p>
<p t="635580" d="7960">And so partly what's happening - you can think of what you're interacting with as something that's really multi-faceted. Truly multi-faceted</p>
<p t="643620" d="3280">And you say, well you're trying to determine what it is.</p>
<p t="647040" d="5700">But the problem is that what it is manifests itself only in accordance with how you behave towards it</p>
<p t="652880" d="6300">And it's actually the case with even objects that you reduce right down to their constituent elements</p>
<p t="659180" d="5380">So you might say like lets talk about subatomic particles. Hypothetically, the most objective thing there is</p>
<p t="664560" d="5380">Well it turns out that whether they're a wave or a particle depends on the way you set up the experiment</p>
<p t="670000" d="6600">Now I don't want to make quantum analogies but what I'm saying is that the object is a very very complicated thing</p>
<p t="676640" d="5200">And so even defining what it is means you have to adopt a frame of reference with regards to it</p>
<p t="681880" d="3060">And you undertake only some procedures and not others</p>
<p t="685000" d="4380">So, when you're defining an object even scientifically you actually don't define the object.</p>
<p t="689480" d="7480">What you say is here is a multi-dimensional entity if you approach it in this manner, that's the procedure, right? The methods.</p>
<p t="697080" d="4140">If you approach it in that manner, it will manifest that set of traits</p>
<p t="701400" d="4240">But the problem is, is that there's all sorts of other traits that it could manifest just as well</p>
<p t="705720" d="1980">If you treated it a different way</p>
<p t="707920" d="7560">And so the object itself is not something that - it's not something easily reducible to a single set of properties</p>
<p t="715800" d="4180">I was talking to one of my students yesterday, he had a pretty smart thing to say about images.</p>
<p t="720020" d="5580">We were talking about deep images you know the sorts that you might see in a really high quality museum</p>
<p t="725920" d="6520">So maybe they're I don't know 15th century or 16th century renaissance  masterpieces</p>
<p t="732500" d="2340">They're inexhaustible to some degree</p>
<p t="734900" d="4560">Which is why they're in museums and people go look at them you know decade after decade</p>
<p t="739600" d="1200">And it's partly because</p>
<p t="742540" d="2160">Every time you look at them you're different</p>
<p t="744900" d="4780">You go in one week, you look at it, you see something. You go in the next week, you look at it and you see something else.</p>
<p t="749680" d="1740">Well it's partly because</p>
<p t="751520" d="3200">You're bringing something entirely different to the situation</p>
<p t="755080" d="7920">and the image is complicated enough to allow it to reflect something new to you depening on the stance you take in relationship to it</p>
<p t="763040" d="1700">And lots of things are like that</p>
<p t="764740" d="1300">lots of things are like that</p>
<p t="766080" d="4860">A book you read when you were sixteen is going to be an entirely different book when you read it when you're 35</p>
<p t="770980" d="4360">Say well the book's the same. It's like, it depends on how you define the book</p>
<p t="775800" d="3000">Because it isn't even obvious where the book is exactly</p>
<p t="778800" d="1740">Well it's on my shelf in the library</p>
<p t="780540" d="5220">It's like no, that's a chunk of paper that's on your shelf in the library</p>
<p t="785760" d="5040">Where exactly the book is, that's a much more difficult question to consider</p>
<p t="790800" d="2540">So it depends on how you define the book</p>
<p t="793680" d="5380">So without a subject, nothing at all would exist to confront objects and to imagine them as such</p>
<p t="799340" d="1780">True this implies that every object</p>
<p t="801120" d="6900">Everything objective in being merely objectified by the subject is the most subjective thing possible</p>
<p t="808020" d="2920">Well you also know this again when you're in an argument with someone</p>
<p t="810940" d="780">";it's you";</p>
<p t="811720" d="1020">";no, it's you";</p>
<p t="812780" d="900">";no it's you";</p>
<p t="813720" d="1820">It's like, you don't know</p>
<p t="815720" d="3680">Are you being biased? Are you looking at the situation incorrectly?</p>
<p t="819400" d="4560">The person you're arguing with trying to convince you that it's your problem</p>
<p t="823960" d="2240">You think ";no you made me angry";</p>
<p t="826340" d="5220">It's like hmm an interesting statement you know? as if you could do that</p>
<p t="831640" d="2500">But it does seem that way, you were being provocative</p>
<p t="834140" d="2120">";Well you're just too sensitive";</p>
<p t="836480" d="1900">";hmm how are we going to settle that?";</p>
<p t="838920" d="11020">Well it's a continual argument and that again has to do with the crazy entangled dynamic between subjective perception and objective perception</p>
<p t="853820" d="2975">I've showed you this before and I actually think this is a pretty good</p>
<p t="856795" d="3350">Schematic representation of what's meant by Dasein</p>
<p t="860145" d="2415">And this is a complicated little diagram</p>
<p t="862760" d="3080">Although the diagram itself is quite simple</p>
<p t="866140" d="3620">It's predicated on the following assumptions</p>
<p t="870360" d="2160">You need to narrow down your world</p>
<p t="872860" d="4500">and what you're doing is narrowing it down from lets say an infinite set of possibilities</p>
<p t="877440" d="2380">To a finite set of manageable possibilities</p>
<p t="879820" d="1740">and you do that a bunch of ways</p>
<p t="881740" d="4940">Partly - merely - you can't your senses aren't acute enough to detect everything.</p>
<p t="886800" d="5280">So pure stupidity in some sense stops you from being absolutely overwhelmed</p>
<p t="892080" d="5320">You don't have eyes in the back of your head for example so you don't have to worry about all those things you're not looking at behind you</p>
<p t="897460" d="2180">But then it's far more than that</p>
<p t="899640" d="4600">You just can't handle that full complexity so there's a continual narrowing process</p>
<p t="904320" d="2460">And then you exist inside that narrowed reality</p>
<p t="906840" d="1700">Like if I look at you like that</p>
<p t="909380" d="4400">There's not a hell of a lot of difference between that looking at you like that</p>
<p t="913920" d="3620">Like I can't really see these people. I can tell they're people, that's all</p>
<p t="917540" d="1460">I can see your face</p>
<p t="919420" d="2700">I've got just about all of it right there</p>
<p t="922560" d="2920">That's a very narrow and you know you're moving your eyes around</p>
<p t="925640" d="2995">and inhabiting this constant narrow space</p>
<p t="928640" d="5080">Well what's that space - what does that space you inhabit consist of</p>
<p t="933840" d="3080">Well that's Dasein that space that you inhabit and so we can say</p>
<p t="936980" d="1360">It's something like this</p>
<p t="938340" d="5220">You have implicit in that perception a sense of where you are and what you are doing right now</p>
<p t="943560" d="1200">it's in the perception</p>
<p t="944900" d="3760">and then in the perception as well is what you're aiming at</p>
<p t="948800" d="3980">Because you're not just sitting here passively or you'd be asleep or you'd be unconscious</p>
<p t="952820" d="2440">You're sitting here doing nothing</p>
<p t="955260" d="1060">You know, physically</p>
<p t="956380" d="3720">But you have an aim in mind and the aim is what you're pointing your eyes at</p>
<p t="960160" d="2480">The aim is what's structuring your perceptions</p>
<p t="962800" d="6940">The aim is what's revealing that part of the world that is being revealed to you, to you</p>
<p t="970320" d="1800">That's the revelation of the world</p>
<p t="972180" d="3360">It also structures your emotions. It also primes your behaviors</p>
<p t="975620" d="2820">So it's not a drive, it's not a goal</p>
<p t="978580" d="5180">it's not a motivation, it's more than that. It's all of that at once.</p>
<p t="983765" d="1820">That's sort of what your personality is</p>
<p t="985900" d="2680">You see the phenomenologists don't really think about personality</p>
<p t="988600" d="3435">They think about the manifestation of your reality</p>
<p t="992040" d="2000">It's not exactly your personality</p>
<p t="994200" d="4640">It's that you're the center of a reality and you constitute that reality</p>
<p t="999160" d="5440">But all of your elements of experience constitute that reality and so it's simplest element is something like</p>
<p t="1004940" d="7360">Where you are and where you're going and the embodied actions you undertake to relate those two things</p>
<p t="1012300" d="4680">Which would include your eye movements because of course perception is an active phenomena</p>
<p t="1017060" d="3040">You are shaking your eyes back and forth unbelievable rapidly</p>
<p t="1020160" d="5580">Otherwise, if you can make your eyes stand still, which you can do with great concentration</p>
<p t="1025740" d="1780">Everything will black out</p>
<p t="1027520" d="6800">Because you have to move your eyes back and forth so the light hits different cells cause the cells get exhausted</p>
<p t="1034440" d="6560">And then they stop reporting. So you're just whipping your eyes back and forth in a micro-way constantly</p>
<p t="1041140" d="3440">And as well as moving them around voluntarily and involuntarily</p>
<p t="1045080" d="4140">So even perception is a lot more like feeling things out with your fingers</p>
<p t="1049340" d="2080">Even when you're using your ears or your eyes</p>
<p t="1051475" d="2690">It's very active, there's no passive perception</p>
<p t="1054165" d="2075">it's a motor act to perceive</p>
<p t="1056340" d="4560">and so your motor act is determined by your hierarchy of values that's one way of looking at it</p>
<p t="1060960" d="5135">So another way of thinking about it is that's how the past and future are implicit in it</p>
<p t="1066100" d="4080">Your very active perception is determined by your entire value structure</p>
<p t="1070180" d="520">So</p>
<p t="1071015" d="3350">It's implicit inside of it, it's folded up inside of it</p>
<p t="1074700" d="2580">You can tell that too because if something violates it</p>
<p t="1077360" d="2480">Again, maybe an argument with someone</p>
<p t="1079920" d="5340">It's good to think about people as the thing you interact with the most as the canonical object</p>
<p t="1085260" d="5340">Cause they're so damn complicated and they get in the way all the time and when someone gets in the way of what you're doing</p>
<p t="1090620" d="3080">You know, it isn't obvious what they're interfering with</p>
<p t="1093700" d="3960">It might be the little micro-routine that you're undertaking right now</p>
<p t="1097900" d="4820">You know, maybe you go home and you make a nice dinner and the person you're making it for is all rude about it</p>
<p t="1102745" d="3070">Okay so what exactly are they getting in the way of?</p>
<p t="1106135" d="1000">Well</p>
<p t="1108920" d="5900">They're certainly getting in the way of your expectations of having a nice emotional time for the next hour</p>
<p t="1115420" d="3460">But you have no idea how indicative that is of some serious flaw</p>
<p t="1118940" d="4735">In you, or them, or the relationship, or the situation, or the way you've conducted your whole life</p>
<p t="1123675" d="2300">Or the way they've conducted their whole life</p>
<p t="1126540" d="1580">and all of that's packed in there</p>
<p t="1128160" d="3100">It's sort of like the unconscious of the psychoanalysts</p>
<p t="1131460" d="5980">but it's more - it's not the same conceptualization. It's another way of looking at the same phenomena</p>
<p t="1137600" d="760">So</p>
<p t="1139360" d="3740">Alright so the two people we're going to talk about most are Medard Boss</p>
<p t="1143520" d="3660">And he was influenced by Martin Heidegger, who was a great philosopher</p>
<p t="1147200" d="6340">Taken to task often because he turned out to be tangled up with the Nazis more than he should've been</p>
<p t="1153680" d="5500">And Husserl, that's Edmund Husserl, who was actually if I remember correctly was Martin Heidegger's teacher</p>
<p t="1159220" d="2280">That's Ludwig Binswanger - and they were</p>
<p t="1161505" d="3420">Both of these two people were influenced both by Freud and Jung</p>
<p t="1166820" d="2420">Okay so here is one of Binswanger's claims</p>
<p t="1169280" d="2300">I love this claim it's such a cool idea</p>
<p t="1171580" d="3380">And I think there is neurological support for it. Neuropsychological support</p>
<p t="1174960" d="5400">What we perceive are ";first and foremost"; not impressions of taste, tone, smell or touch</p>
<p t="1181060" d="1900">Not even in things or objects, but meanings</p>
<p t="1183700" d="1915">Well that's an interesting idea</p>
<p t="1185620" d="820">Because</p>
<p t="1188100" d="5880">You know it's been said that every person in an unconscious exponent of some great philosopher's presuppositions</p>
<p t="1194240" d="5160">Well, mostly the way you think about the way you perceive is that there are objects in the world</p>
<p t="1199440" d="1300">You see the objects</p>
<p t="1200760" d="2440">You think about the objects, you evaluate the objects</p>
<p t="1203240" d="2700">You decide how to act on the objects, and then you act</p>
<p t="1206340" d="1500">Right? it's from</p>
<p t="1208500" d="4120">Object, sense, perception, emotion, cognition, action</p>
<p t="1212740" d="2840">That's wrong. That isn't how it works</p>
<p t="1215820" d="2080">It's partly not the way it works because</p>
<p t="1218000" d="4020">You're actually - the way that you interact with the world exists at multiple levels</p>
<p t="1222020" d="1060">So for example</p>
<p t="1223180" d="3400">You have reflexes so if I</p>
<p t="1226800" d="5100">If I poke you hard, you'll react like that. You'll jerk back</p>
<p t="1232020" d="1940">And that, you do that without thinking</p>
<p t="1233960" d="6200">That's part of a neurological circuit that's very deeply embedded and that's virtually automatic</p>
<p t="1240160" d="3180">It's reflexive. It doesn't require conscious perception at all</p>
<p t="1243540" d="1960">It's too slow for starters</p>
<p t="1245720" d="4360">And so you have - there's multiple levels of you interacting with the world.</p>
<p t="1250080" d="4440">And at one level, you're seeing objects, you're thinking about them, you're planning what to do</p>
<p t="1254620" d="5980">But you're doing all sorts of other things that are way faster than that and other things that are way slower at the same time.</p>
<p t="1260860" d="2780">Now what Binswanger claims</p>
<p t="1263980" d="2980">Is that what you see in the world are meanings</p>
<p t="1267460" d="4500">So it's the meaning detection first and the object recognition second</p>
<p t="1272100" d="2020">Now that's a hell of a claim, that is</p>
<p t="1274120" d="2660">But there's definitely levels of your nervous system</p>
<p t="1276800" d="1860">That operate in that manner</p>
<p t="1278660" d="940">So for example</p>
<p t="1279600" d="2920">Here's a good example, people have blind sight</p>
<p t="1282780" d="3800">There visual cortex is damaged they can't see objects</p>
<p t="1286620" d="1260">So they think they're blind</p>
<p t="1287980" d="6160">But if you show them an angry face, they'll manifest a change in the skin conductants, They'll orient</p>
<p t="1294360" d="4460">And it means that the eyes are still mapping the face onto the amygdala</p>
<p t="1299020" d="4760">And the amygdala is mapping the pattern onto the body, no object perception</p>
<p t="1303860" d="880">Pattern</p>
<p t="1304900" d="760">Pattern</p>
<p t="1305840" d="800">Pattern</p>
<p t="1306800" d="1480">No object perception</p>
<p t="1308460" d="4800">And so the meaning is what's being perceived first and foremost</p>
<p t="1313380" d="3940">And you have to perceive meanings first because you actually want to stay alive</p>
<p t="1317620" d="1160">That's the trick</p>
<p t="1318940" d="5180">So the world is full of these things that have meanings to you that are relevant to your survival</p>
<p t="1324220" d="4980">And what you're perceiving first is the relevance of the pattern to your survival</p>
<p t="1329400" d="3005">And the idea that you can conceptualize that as a set of objects</p>
<p t="1332405" d="2295">Well first of all, that's a pretty new idea</p>
<p t="1335420" d="2060">Technically speaking, right? Because</p>
<p t="1337940" d="7540">Technically speaking we didn't really start to conceive the world as subject in an objective world until we really formalized science</p>
<p t="1345580" d="3400">Now science was implicit long before it became explicit</p>
<p t="1349040" d="3300">But it didn't become explicit until about 500 years ago</p>
<p t="1352540" d="2080">So you react to meanings</p>
<p t="1354620" d="1300">So here's an example</p>
<p t="1356060" d="1520">Babies</p>
<p t="1357740" d="860">if you</p>
<p t="1358940" d="2940">If you have two surfaces and you put a piece of glass between them</p>
<p t="1361920" d="1200">You know, they're elevated</p>
<p t="1363140" d="4860">And you put an 8 month year old baby on the one surface so they can crawl</p>
<p t="1368140" d="3060">It won't crawl across the space</p>
<p t="1371460" d="4600">And you might say it sees a hole and won't crawl across it</p>
<p t="1376080" d="2740">But that isn't what it sees. It sees a place to fall off</p>
<p t="1379900" d="2120">Direct, that's direct perception</p>
<p t="1382020" d="1880">So when I see this for example</p>
<p t="1384280" d="3440">My eyes see that as a pattern</p>
<p t="1387960" d="3740">That pattern's on my retina it's propagated through my optic nerve</p>
<p t="1391700" d="4120">It's propagated into my brain, it's propagated onto my motor cortex</p>
<p t="1395940" d="1500">And the propagation is</p>
<p t="1397440" d="1000">This</p>
<p t="1398665" d="1000">That</p>
<p t="1400060" d="1720">Right? So I can pick it up</p>
<p t="1402000" d="4000">And as soon as - when I look at that this is implicit</p>
<p t="1406140" d="2180">That's implicit in the perception</p>
<p t="1408320" d="3540">You think well why do you see that at the size and resolution you see it at?</p>
<p t="1412120" d="1080">That's why</p>
<p t="1413885" d="3090">So the fact that you see it that way has this implicit in it</p>
<p t="1416975" d="2890">It isn't that you see the object and match your hand to it</p>
<p t="1419865" d="3715">It's that matching your hand to it is part of the perception of the object</p>
<p t="1423580" d="1640">It's what gives the object meaning</p>
<p t="1425580" d="3000">And so you see actually you perceive the meaning of the object</p>
<p t="1428660" d="1540">It's part of the perception</p>
<p t="1430240" d="2720">And you can't not see the meaning of the object</p>
<p t="1433020" d="5580">Well if you're a scientist you can sort of separate out the object from its meaning</p>
<p t="1438600" d="1580">That's actually what science does</p>
<p t="1440440" d="2200">It tears the object away from its meaning</p>
<p t="1443080" d="2260">And then of course there is nothing meaningful left</p>
<p t="1445460" d="4480">So science ends up value free. But that's because the meaning has been torn out of it</p>
<p t="1450060" d="1920">Now there's technical reasons for doing that</p>
<p t="1451980" d="4600">But Binswanger's point is don't kid yourself you see the meaning first. Here's an example</p>
<p t="1456840" d="2440">You watch the trade towers fall</p>
<p t="1459360" d="2000">What did you see?</p>
<p t="1462140" d="2240">Well you could say you saw the towers fall</p>
<p t="1464400" d="2720">It's like why are you in shock for two days afterwards then?</p>
<p t="1467560" d="3780">Well because what are the towers exactly?</p>
<p t="1471520" d="3360">As long as they're standing and operating, they're towers.</p>
<p t="1474900" d="2840">As soon as they fall, God only knows what they are</p>
<p t="1477740" d="2295">Maybe they're the beginning of the next war</p>
<p t="1480035" d="3010">You know? Who knows what they are?</p>
<p t="1483220" d="2280">And so everyone was in shock for three days</p>
<p t="1485520" d="4660">Because what they saw was the indeterminate meaning of that event</p>
<p t="1490480" d="2160">And it opened all sorts of gateways</p>
<p t="1492680" d="3460">It's like well, the towers fell, there's gateways open everywhere.</p>
<p t="1496180" d="3720">We don't know what's going on. We don't know what's going to happen next. We don't know where we are</p>
<p t="1500060" d="3980">And that's direct perception mapped onto your body. Bang, you're in shock</p>
<p t="1504060" d="1480">You see the meaning first</p>
<p t="1505920" d="3100">And well you constrain it down to well why are you so upset?</p>
<p t="1509060" d="1180">Well the towers fell</p>
<p t="1510240" d="3000">It's like that's the best you can do for a verbal utterance</p>
<p t="1513280" d="2300">It's what your perceptual systems reported to you</p>
<p t="1515640" d="2440">But God only knows what happened</p>
<p t="1518140" d="4020">We still don't really know what it meant that they fell</p>
<p t="1522280" d="3100">Now most things have put themselves back together but</p>
<p t="1528100" d="1920">And then you think well what does it mean?</p>
<p t="1530160" d="2740">What does it mean that what you see first is the meaning?</p>
<p t="1533020" d="3500">and that's a really tricky question because you might say well</p>
<p t="1536560" d="3760">That's when you get back to the problem of what constitutes real</p>
<p t="1540380" d="4280">So I could say well you've evolved to see the meaning</p>
<p t="1545160" d="1140">Well then we might ask</p>
<p t="1546300" d="3640">Well if you've evoled to see the meaning and that's kept you alive</p>
<p t="1549960" d="2040">Is there anything more real than the meaning?</p>
<p t="1552395" d="3010">Because somebody who is a materialist would say ";well no, the object is more real";</p>
<p t="1555405" d="2575">It's like no, it depends on how you define real</p>
<p t="1558000" d="5520">It might be that the most real thing about the visual cliff is that that's a falling off place</p>
<p t="1563840" d="3040">And that its secondary description as a you know an object</p>
<p t="1566880" d="1520">A hole or something like that</p>
<p t="1568440" d="4080">That's something you paint over the top of the primary reality</p>
<p t="1572920" d="1000">And so,</p>
<p t="1576020" d="4660">Well here's a practical application of it or at least one of the things I think is practical</p>
<p t="1580680" d="5500">You know, you can have experiences that differ in their, lets call it, high quality meaning</p>
<p t="1586300" d="3460">You know so you get engaged and engrossed in something and you're happy about that</p>
<p t="1589760" d="1020">It's not that you're happy</p>
<p t="1590780" d="2780">It's that you're engaged and engrossed in it, you would do it again</p>
<p t="1593580" d="2380">Even though it might take effort</p>
<p t="1595980" d="2760">You can tell that where you are is meaningful</p>
<p t="1598840" d="2880">Well I think what happens in that situation is that</p>
<p t="1602060" d="1940">You're in a Piagetian place</p>
<p t="1604020" d="5620">Where many of the games that you're playing are stacked sort of isomorphically on top of one another</p>
<p t="1609640" d="4475">And the experience of meaning is the fact that you're playing a small game properly</p>
<p t="1614120" d="2860">Nested inside a larger game, you're playing it properly</p>
<p t="1617020" d="4340">Nested inside a larger game, you're playing it properly too, etc all the way out</p>
<p t="1621400" d="4240">Past is balanced, future is balanced everything is stacked up</p>
<p t="1625800" d="5480">And there's a report coming from your being telling you that, that's why you're engaged</p>
<p t="1631620" d="3740">You might say well maybe that's real. Maybe it's more real than anything else</p>
<p t="1635360" d="6340">That's a strange thing because if you think that meaning is separate and secondary from the real objective world</p>
<p t="1641800" d="2180">Then the reality is the object</p>
<p t="1644240" d="3460">But it isn't obvious that the reality is the object</p>
<p t="1647800" d="3020">It's certainly not how we act</p>
<p t="1650820" d="1840">It's not how we perceive</p>
<p t="1653315" d="1050">And so</p>
<p t="1655080" d="4160">Did we evolve to perceive reality? It depends on what you mean by perceive</p>
<p t="1659240" d="7620">Perceive might mean did we evolve mechanisms that allowed us to survive in the face of that reality. Yes.</p>
<p t="1667080" d="4100">Is that whats real? What enables you to survive in the face of reality?</p>
<p t="1671735" d="1410">It's a definition</p>
<p t="1673675" d="3380">It's a perfectly reasonable definition unless you can come up with a better one</p>
<p t="1677055" d="1990">Meanings are primary</p>
<p t="1680260" d="3000">Now that brings up a strange issue</p>
<p t="1683260" d="3035">So what determines the meaning of what it is you're perceiving</p>
<p t="1686300" d="4580">Well this is where Binswanger and Boss disagree</p>
<p t="1691100" d="1380">Binswanger says</p>
<p t="1692480" d="5860">It's the a-priori ontological structure. The world design, or matrix of meaning</p>
<p t="1698340" d="1680">Okay so what does that mean?</p>
<p t="1700240" d="5520">Well, you have a particular history. Biological and cultural and individual</p>
<p t="1705900" d="5820">And you're viewing the world through the lense of that set of particularities</p>
<p t="1711740" d="4360">So it's almost if you are behind a curtain and the curtain has certain hoels in it</p>
<p t="1716100" d="2900">And you can see through the wholes in the curtain</p>
<p t="1719080" d="6420">but the curtain is your construction so the curtain with the holes determines what you see</p>
<p t="1725540" d="4400">Well, Boss would say no it's the opposite in a very strange thing</p>
<p t="1730160" d="5300">The meaning of the world manifests itself to you more or less of its own accord</p>
<p t="1735705" d="1000">And</p>
<p t="1737305" d="2140">It's a tougher one to explain</p>
<p t="1741180" d="3320">Disclosure of meaning: Boss the revelation of the object</p>
<p t="1744600" d="3120">The emergence of the phenomena: the numinous</p>
<p t="1747720" d="3280">The very word phenomena is derived from phainesthai</p>
<p t="1751200" d="4460">To shine forth, to appear,  to unveil itself, to come out of concealment or darkness</p>
<p t="1755680" d="3000">Okay here's an example you see someone beautiful</p>
<p t="1759575" d="1830">Is it your perception</p>
<p t="1762315" d="2810">is it your perception or does the beauty exist?</p>
<p t="1765940" d="2360">That's the difference between Binswanger and Boss</p>
<p t="1768320" d="5660">Cause Binswanger would say well the reason that thing appears to you as beautiful is because of the way you're filtering it</p>
<p t="1774080" d="1760">And Boss would say no</p>
<p t="1776240" d="5780">The beauty inheres in the object itself and manifests itself. It shines forth</p>
<p t="1782280" d="4000">And so I really like this concept this concept of phenomena</p>
<p t="1786280" d="1520">That's why they're phenomenologists</p>
<p t="1787860" d="1820">phainesthai means to shine forth</p>
<p t="1789780" d="4900">From the phenomenological perspective you pursue those things that shine forth</p>
<p t="1795120" d="5460">Now you remember this is kind of a parallel idea</p>
<p t="1800640" d="2500">I suppose it's a parallel of Jungian ideas</p>
<p t="1803260" d="3940">You remember in Harry Potter that when they're playing Quidditch he's always chasing the snitch?</p>
<p t="1807565" d="3230">And you remember how, if I've got this correctly,</p>
<p t="1810940" d="5360">Quidditch is basically two games at the same time right? There's the standard game and there's the game that the seekers play</p>
<p t="1816360" d="1820">Yes? I've got that right?</p>
<p t="1818180" d="2000">What happens if the seeker gets the snitch?</p>
<p t="1820840" d="2320">Games over right? They win</p>
<p t="1823340" d="4480">Very interesting. She has a brilliant imagination that woman, Rowling</p>
<p t="1828000" d="4840">So the idea is that in every game there's two games going on at the same time. There's the ordinary game</p>
<p t="1832840" d="4600">And there's the game that the seekers play and the seekers chase the thing that shines at them</p>
<p t="1837660" d="3820">And that's what that little thing is the snitch. It's a round circle with wings.</p>
<p t="1841480" d="2980">It's a very very old old old symbol</p>
<p t="1844460" d="1560">It's a symbol of what</p>
<p t="1846020" d="5160">It's a symbol of reality before it's fractionated into its parts</p>
<p t="1851180" d="2340">I don't know how to say it any more clearly than that</p>
<p t="1853540" d="1100">It's a symbol of</p>
<p t="1854880" d="1100">It's a symbol of</p>
<p t="1855980" d="3100">Imagine that there are things that move forward to make you curious</p>
<p t="1859400" d="4700">And you were trying to figure out what was common among all the things that made you curious</p>
<p t="1864280" d="3080">That thing that Harry Potter's chasing, that's a symbol of that</p>
<p t="1867360" d="5260">It's golden like the sun, it flits around and attracts your attention and it's always moving</p>
<p t="1872680" d="2040">And if you're seeking, you chase it.</p>
<p t="1875200" d="3840">So that's the phenomenological idea, that's the disclosure of meaning</p>
<p t="1879040" d="4280">You say well when you're curious about something, why are you curious about that?</p>
<p t="1883840" d="4320">Is it calling to you? Or is it something that you're interpreting?</p>
<p t="1888260" d="1560">Well I would say it's both</p>
<p t="1889840" d="3120">I think that's the way to resolve this puzzle</p>
<p t="1893020" d="940">It's that</p>
<p t="1893960" d="3100">There isn't a perceiving entity without a structure</p>
<p t="1897460" d="4400">And your structure has been evolving itself for three and a half billion years</p>
<p t="1901860" d="2580">There's no perceiving entity without a structure</p>
<p t="1904540" d="3240">But by the same token the thing that's being perceived</p>
<p t="1907780" d="3780">Also shines forth with its own potential manifestation</p>
<p t="1911580" d="2780">And you need to think of it both ways at the same time</p>
<p t="1914520" d="3200">But the curiosity issue is a really fascinating one</p>
<p t="1917920" d="2820">Because curiosity pulls you forward</p>
<p t="1920860" d="1420">It's not random</p>
<p t="1922360" d="1540">That's the thing that's so cool</p>
<p t="1923900" d="3320">You can't really control it, but it's not random</p>
<p t="1927260" d="2260">If your curiosity is random, you're schizophrenic</p>
<p t="1929700" d="1480">And I mean that technically</p>
<p t="1931280" d="6880">Because one of the things that happens to schziphrenics is that the mechanisms that establish relevance become pathologized</p>
<p t="1938160" d="2000">And they see meaning everywhere, randomly</p>
<p t="1940160" d="2460">And that's partly why they generate delusions</p>
<p t="1942660" d="5600">Because the incoherent manifestation of meaning calls out for a representation</p>
<p t="1948260" d="3520">They develop a paranoid delusion if they're intelligent enough to put everything together</p>
<p t="1952080" d="3175">So you're curious and something pulls you forward</p>
<p t="1955260" d="5600">Well you can interact with the curiosity  and you can follow it but you can't really direct it</p>
<p t="1960880" d="2320">The question is where is it taking you?</p>
<p t="1963360" d="3800">So that little ball, that was a manifestation</p>
<p t="1967160" d="4280">Of what the Greeks referred to - Greeks? Is that right? - Mercurius</p>
<p t="1971680" d="2180">It's a Roman and Greek God Mercurius</p>
<p t="1973860" d="4420">The spirit Mercurius is the messenger of the Gods. The winged messenger of the Gods</p>
<p t="1978300" d="1460">It flits around</p>
<p t="1979800" d="2440">You say well the curiosity pulls you forward</p>
<p t="1982240" d="1140">To where?</p>
<p t="1983380" d="2560">Well to wherever it wants to take you</p>
<p t="1986220" d="1720">Well that's a Jungian idea as well</p>
<p t="1987940" d="5060">Is that your curiosity is like the manifestation of your self to the ego</p>
<p t="1993300" d="5440">Right? It's the thing that you could be in the future calling you forward</p>
<p t="1998780" d="1120">Something like that</p>
<p t="2000000" d="1400">Very strange idea</p>
<p t="2002400" d="3095">Very interesting. See when you start to understand</p>
<p t="2005500" d="4020">That you're not in control of what makes you interested in things</p>
<p t="2009620" d="1700">The whole world shifts around on you</p>
<p t="2011320" d="4940">Because the question is if you're not in control of that, what the hell is directing it?</p>
<p t="2016580" d="1480">What's going on?</p>
<p t="2018060" d="1280">It's not you</p>
<p t="2019340" d="1820">It's not under your control</p>
<p t="2021340" d="3120">It's not random. It's alive. It's dynamic</p>
<p t="2024500" d="2320">It has an orientation towards something</p>
<p t="2026900" d="1540">That's the Jungian self.</p>
<p t="2028520" d="2260">Or that's the manifestation of meaning</p>
<p t="2030780" d="1320">Yes very strange</p>
<p t="2033220" d="1340">I told you this already</p>
<p t="2034560" d="5020">See there's an old representation, a very old represenation of the snitch right there</p>
<p t="2039940" d="2340">Now this is an old symbol, eh?</p>
<p t="2042280" d="2000">You've got this dragon of chaos here</p>
<p t="2044700" d="1340">It's kind of like an octopus as well</p>
<p t="2046040" d="5480">That twist in its tail refers to infinity. Dragons almost always have an infinite tail like that</p>
<p t="2051520" d="3060">And it's got the claws of a bird, maybe a bird of prey</p>
<p t="2054580" d="2580">The body of an animal and the head of a snake</p>
<p t="2057695" d="1330">And then down here</p>
<p t="2059025" d="4575">You see its got the sun up there so it's sort of aiming upwards towards the sun this thing</p>
<p t="2063740" d="4200">And then down here is this thing called the round chaos. It's an old alchemical system</p>
<p t="2067960" d="3000">And if you look the dragon is fertilizing this</p>
<p t="2071395" d="2540">And that has potential in it like an egg</p>
<p t="2074325" d="1540">It's full of potential</p>
<p t="2077200" d="3480">And so it's matter and spirit at the same time</p>
<p t="2081220" d="4400">It's sort of like it's a representation of that which you're exploring</p>
<p t="2085620" d="2020">Because you could say well the thing that you're exploring</p>
<p t="2087640" d="1680">It's sort of a constructivist idea</p>
<p t="2089320" d="1840">You explore something new</p>
<p t="2091200" d="2220">What do you generate from the exploration?</p>
<p t="2093540" d="3820">You. Because as you explore it you learn things. That changes you.</p>
<p t="2097360" d="3160">So you generate psyche out of the exploration. That's spirit.</p>
<p t="2100760" d="2120">And you also generate the world out of it</p>
<p t="2102940" d="3495">But the thing to begin with is psyche and world at the same time</p>
<p t="2106440" d="1740">And that's what this thing represents</p>
<p t="2108220" d="1840">And that's what Harry Potter is chasing</p>
<p t="2110380" d="1780">That's what makes him a seeker</p>
<p t="2113380" d="1280">Very strange ideas</p>
<p t="2114740" d="1300">Now I'm going to tell you a dream</p>
<p t="2116040" d="2840">There was a dream I had while working on these ideas</p>
<p t="2118880" d="1960">And I'm going to tell you the dream for two reasons</p>
<p t="2120840" d="2860">One is because it bears directly on these ideas</p>
<p t="2123700" d="5440">Two because well we just covered psychoanalytic thought and I want to show you how a dream can work</p>
<p t="2129280" d="4195">Cause it's not easy to find a dream that you can interpret in a way that's public that makes sense</p>
<p t="2133475" d="3000">Cause they're usually so tightly defined contextually</p>
<p t="2136480" d="4500">You can define them in the therapeutic context because you know so much about the person</p>
<p t="2141020" d="3895">It's very hard to pull that out and make it meaningful outside of that context</p>
<p t="2144920" d="1520">But this dream works. Ok so,</p>
<p t="2146740" d="1080">I was dreaming</p>
<p t="2148380" d="4620">I was dreaming that there was a small object. It was a circle, a sphere about this big.</p>
<p t="2153420" d="3060">And it was floating on top of the Atlantic Ocean</p>
<p t="2156540" d="4080">And I had kind of a birds eye view of it and I was following it along</p>
<p t="2160620" d="3180">Like maybe you know like a drone would follow behind an object</p>
<p t="2163860" d="1280">And it was floating</p>
<p t="2165140" d="3400">And it was really zipping along man, it was really really fast</p>
<p t="2168540" d="2080">And then the scene shifted</p>
<p t="2170620" d="4880">To a bunch of scientists they were sitting inside a room full of television monitors</p>
<p t="2175560" d="2300">And they were watching this thing move across the Ocean</p>
<p t="2177880" d="6580">And so it was here and it had four hurricanes beside it one here, one here, one here, and one here</p>
<p t="2184460" d="2040">So it was in the center of four hurricanes</p>
<p t="2186500" d="6380">So whatever it was was like some bloody potent thing zipping across the ocean</p>
<p t="2193000" d="3680">Then the scientists got a hold of it I guess and the scene shifted</p>
<p t="2196680" d="3080">And I was in a museum like an old Victorian museum</p>
<p t="2200120" d="3380">And this thing, this ball was now inside a</p>
<p t="2203560" d="2700">Imagine a wood stand</p>
<p t="2206320" d="1780">With a glass case on top of it</p>
<p t="2208100" d="4020">It was inside the glass case and it was floating and it was sort of pulsing a little bit</p>
<p t="2212120" d="3360">And so inside the room there was Stephen Hawking</p>
<p t="2216860" d="3100">And the American President</p>
<p t="2220060" d="2400">I don't remember who it was he was sort of faceless</p>
<p t="2222480" d="2700">But Stephen I thought, Stephen Hawking? What the hell</p>
<p t="2225180" d="1480">Disembodied intellect</p>
<p t="2227280" d="2480">That's Stephen Hawking so that's what that meant</p>
<p t="2229840" d="3740">And the President well he's just the symbol of order</p>
<p t="2233580" d="4220">And so this thing whatever it was that was surrounded by these winds</p>
<p t="2237900" d="1980">Had been placed into a category system right?</p>
<p t="2239880" d="4700">It was in a museum, it was boxed in. It had been conceptualized and categorized</p>
<p t="2244580" d="4680">Partly by disembodied intellect, that was Stephen Hawking,  and partly by social order</p>
<p t="2249260" d="2920">And so there's a Binswanger Boss thing going on there</p>
<p t="2252200" d="3960">The thing pulses and is alive so its got its own power</p>
<p t="2256200" d="3580">But it's also encapsulated in a category system</p>
<p t="2259780" d="3660">So I'm a third person observer in there I'm not in the room I'm just seeing this</p>
<p t="2263440" d="960">So that was fine</p>
<p t="2264400" d="1460">So the next thing that happened</p>
<p t="2265920" d="2880">Oh yes, one of them described the features of the room</p>
<p t="2268800" d="1960">Its walls were seven feet thick</p>
<p t="2270760" d="1900">They didn't want this thing going anywhere</p>
<p t="2272660" d="2480">And it was made out of titanium dioxide</p>
<p t="2275140" d="1380">I thought, what the hell is that?</p>
<p t="2276520" d="1360">Well it's a paint</p>
<p t="2277880" d="4360">It's a paint substance but it's also what the hull of the Starship Enterprise is made out of</p>
<p t="2282260" d="5640">So my dream was saying well what's the hardest substance there is? Well it's titanium dioxide</p>
<p t="2287900" d="1720">It's not getting out of that box</p>
<p t="2290220" d="2700">The walls were designed to permanently constrain the object</p>
<p t="2292920" d="2855">Okay now the next thing that happened was this object was</p>
<p t="2295780" d="1800">You could tell it was kind of alive</p>
<p t="2297680" d="4220">And it kept shifting around and at one point it turned into a chrysalis you know a cocoon</p>
<p t="2302280" d="2660">And I thought what the hell does that mean?</p>
<p t="2304940" d="2900">And then, so it turned into a cocoon</p>
<p t="2307840" d="2620">And I don't know if you've seen a chrysalis when it's just about to hatch</p>
<p t="2310460" d="3580">But it twitches around eh? It's alive that thing</p>
<p t="2314100" d="1960">So they're very strange things</p>
<p t="2316080" d="2480">And then at the end it turned itself into a pipe</p>
<p t="2318560" d="1640">Like a Meerschaum pipe</p>
<p t="2320200" d="1260">And I thought</p>
<p t="2322040" d="1800">Then it reformed itself into a sphere</p>
<p t="2323840" d="1260">And just shot right out of the room</p>
<p t="2325100" d="2540">Like the walls weren't even there</p>
<p t="2327700" d="2440">It decided it was gone bang! It was gone</p>
<p t="2330340" d="2480">And I woke up and I thought what the hell</p>
<p t="2332820" d="1440">What the hell does that mean?</p>
<p t="2334340" d="2040">It took me forever to figure this out</p>
<p t="2336400" d="3460">So then about two years after experiencing this dream,</p>
<p t="2340160" d="1880">I was reading Dante's Inferno</p>
<p t="2342140" d="3060">In the ninth Canto, a messenger from God appears</p>
<p t="2345240" d="2020">So Dante goes down into hell right?</p>
<p t="2347260" d="2760">It was Dante's attempt to describe</p>
<p t="2350380" d="1680">It's brilliant</p>
<p t="2352120" d="3380">So imagine that you go to a bad place psychologically right?</p>
<p t="2355540" d="3000">So your life has collapsed that's terrible</p>
<p t="2358540" d="4040">But then you're trying to figure out what you did wrong and how you're to blame for it</p>
<p t="2362600" d="2260">And so what you do is a descent</p>
<p t="2364880" d="3420">A descent into your own foolishness and stupidity</p>
<p t="2368340" d="1520">Level, by level, by level</p>
<p t="2369860" d="1840">And that's what Dante was trying to explain</p>
<p t="2371700" d="1660">That's what that hell was</p>
<p t="2373360" d="3780">Levels of catastrophe and there's something right at the bottom</p>
<p t="2377320" d="3160">And he found that it was betrayal that was at the bottom</p>
<p t="2380680" d="2520">So in any case I was reading that</p>
<p t="2383200" d="2760">And there's a line in there that made me remember this dream</p>
<p t="2385960" d="2120">Cause I tried to figure out this dream for years eh</p>
<p t="2389320" d="3000"> </p>
<p t="2392325" d="2810"> </p>
<p t="2395135" d="3110"> </p>
<p t="2399185" d="3150"> </p>
<p t="2402335" d="3010"> </p>
<p t="2405345" d="2690"> </p>
<p t="2408035" d="2970"> </p>
<p t="2411005" d="2650"> </p>
<p t="2413655" d="2890"> </p>
<p t="2416545" d="2770"> </p>
<p t="2419315" d="3000"> </p>
<p t="2422320" d="2820"> </p>
<p t="2427200" d="3120">So that was like a herald of the arrival of this messenger</p>
<p t="2430320" d="1160">It's a very powerful scene</p>
<p t="2431480" d="2920">And I thought about this dream with this thing with the four storms</p>
<p t="2434780" d="500">So</p>
<p t="2436000" d="4940">The pipe thing that really, that really took me forever to figure out</p>
<p t="2441100" d="2660">And I finally remembered this painting by Magritte</p>
<p t="2443960" d="1060">This is not a pipe</p>
<p t="2445760" d="1940">Right so what does that mean?</p>
<p t="2449560" d="5340">Well what it means is the representation is not the thing</p>
<p t="2455180" d="2040">It's a very famous painting right?</p>
<p t="2457305" d="2350">The representation is not the thing</p>
<p t="2461115" d="1950">Well even the perception is not the thing</p>
<p t="2463065" d="1835">And that's what the dream was trying to get at</p>
<p t="2464920" d="1000">It's like this thing</p>
<p t="2466960" d="3240">This thing that was so powerful and so capable of transforming</p>
<p t="2470200" d="3020">Could be encapsulated temporarily within a conceptual system</p>
<p t="2473220" d="2880">But whenever it decided to leave it was just going to leave</p>
<p t="2476420" d="1000">And so</p>
<p t="2477700" d="4040">What is was referring to was the potential that there is inside objects</p>
<p t="2481820" d="1140">So for example</p>
<p t="2482980" d="2760">And it's such a complicated thing to explain</p>
<p t="2485800" d="2480">Nobody knew what cell phones were going to do</p>
<p t="2488900" d="1580">You make the cell phone</p>
<p t="2490480" d="1240">You think you know what it is</p>
<p t="2491720" d="1600">You don't know what it is</p>
<p t="2493320" d="2560">No one knew what the birth control pill was going to do</p>
<p t="2496320" d="2980">You make it, you think you know what it is, you have no idea what it is</p>
<p t="2499500" d="2220">And it's going to do some of the things you think it will do</p>
<p t="2501740" d="3160">And it's going to do a bunch of things you have no idea about</p>
<p t="2505000" d="1480">And that's because</p>
<p t="2506480" d="2240">Things are more complex than they look</p>
<p t="2508760" d="1860">They're multi-dimensional and they have</p>
<p t="2510620" d="3820">I wouldn't say a life exactly but they have an intrinsic complexity</p>
<p t="2514500" d="2260">That tends to unfold across time</p>
<p t="2516760" d="1500">And it's only somewhat predictable</p>
<p t="2518280" d="5040">And so you have things under your control and in your grasp to some limited degree</p>
<p t="2523320" d="3400">But at any point it's like the switch in the yin yang symbol</p>
<p t="2526740" d="2440">At any time chaos can collapse into order</p>
<p t="2529260" d="2020">Or order can collapse into chaos</p>
<p t="2531280" d="1540">And that's what that dream meant</p>
<p t="2534840" d="3640">Another painting by Magritte trying to express the same thing right?</p>
<p t="2538480" d="3540">All men in suits, all uniform, all thinking the same way</p>
<p t="2542020" d="2200">Same haircuts, completely socialized</p>
<p t="2544220" d="2940">Blinded by their own perceptions</p>
<p t="2547780" d="1140">That's us</p>
<p t="2548920" d="3620">Cause you think well your perceptions illuminate and bring you information</p>
<p t="2552540" d="1820">It's yes and no</p>
<p t="2554360" d="2340">They also constrain to equal degree</p>
<p t="2558380" d="2220">I dreamed much later about a year later</p>
<p t="2560600" d="1860">This was a very cool image too</p>
<p t="2562460" d="3700">You know that image I think is it  Da Vinci or Michelangelo</p>
<p t="2566160" d="2800">Of the man inscribed in the square inside the circle</p>
<p t="2568960" d="1060">It's a very famous image</p>
<p t="2570160" d="1360">Well it was like that except</p>
<p t="2572200" d="2060">It was a cube and not a square</p>
<p t="2574520" d="4880">And so there was kind of a faceless person, almost like a mannequin inside this cube</p>
<p t="2579980" d="2620">And he was suspended about two feet off the ground</p>
<p t="2582600" d="1700">And on the front wall</p>
<p t="2585100" d="3680">It was like wall paper designs, there were these little squares about this big</p>
<p t="2588780" d="3240">And they mandalas square with circles inside them</p>
<p t="2592020" d="3780">And then inside the circle there was a little snake tail that was out</p>
<p t="2595800" d="2640">And the whole wall was covered with these snake tails</p>
<p t="2598760" d="900">And the person</p>
<p t="2600120" d="2340">When the person walked forward the wall would move forward</p>
<p t="2602460" d="2340">And when he walked backwards the wall would move backwards</p>
<p t="2604800" d="2220">So it was always this far away</p>
<p t="2607100" d="3660">And he could reach out and pull any of those snakes into being</p>
<p t="2611100" d="2760">And so that was another dream of the same sort of idea</p>
<p t="2613860" d="1600">What do you have in front of you?</p>
<p t="2615460" d="1200">A world of objects</p>
<p t="2616660" d="700">No</p>
<p t="2618380" d="2760">You have a world of potential in front of you</p>
<p t="2621340" d="3080">And you can interact with any aspect of that potential</p>
<p t="2624440" d="1940">And while you're doing so, you realize it</p>
<p t="2626380" d="3200">You pull something into being that wouldn't have been there before</p>
<p t="2629680" d="3360">And what you see in front of you is a wall of potential</p>
<p t="2633580" d="2800">The potential is not infinite because you're constrained</p>
<p t="2636560" d="1400">But, it's still</p>
<p t="2638100" d="4820">For all intents and purposes it will do you just fine it's more potential than you could ever need</p>
<p t="2642920" d="1280">And so the dream</p>
<p t="2644260" d="1080">See dreams</p>
<p t="2647980" d="3640">Dreams are at the forefront of thinking</p>
<p t="2651860" d="1820">They get there before you</p>
<p t="2653720" d="2860">The creative imagination is at the forefront of thinking</p>
<p t="2656580" d="3135">If you think that you're moving out into the unknown</p>
<p t="2659720" d="1620">To gather new information</p>
<p t="2661360" d="2440">What gets there first is the imagination</p>
<p t="2663820" d="2980">Obviously that's what Piaget says about children as well</p>
<p t="2666800" d="1600">You imagine it first</p>
<p t="2668440" d="2340">Then maybe you can represent it in speech</p>
<p t="2670780" d="2840">And a dream is part of that imaginative process</p>
<p t="2673620" d="1400">That's what artists are doing</p>
<p t="2675120" d="2620">They're going out into the unknown</p>
<p t="2677800" d="2020">And representing it imaginatively</p>
<p t="2679820" d="1400">So what does that painting mean?</p>
<p t="2681220" d="2940">Well if the artist knew that he'd just write it down</p>
<p t="2684500" d="6220">Right? The art is beyond what's articulable otherwise it's not art it's just propaganda</p>
<p t="2691100" d="4620">So the artist and the dream their out on the frontier right? That's the open imagination</p>
<p t="2696000" d="2260">And so when you're conceptualizing new things</p>
<p t="2698300" d="4420">The dream and the imagination can bring you places that you don't even know that you can go</p>
<p t="2703120" d="1220">And it's a mystery too</p>
<p t="2704380" d="1820">It's like I don't know how I figured this out</p>
<p t="2706200" d="3800">It was as if the figuring out manifested itself inside me</p>
<p t="2710000" d="2080">Cause that's the experience in a dream right?</p>
<p t="2712100" d="2680">You don't feel ";I dreamed this up";</p>
<p t="2714780" d="4020">You feel ";I had a dream."; Where did that come from?</p>
<p t="2719440" d="3400">It springs out of the unknown and offers something to you</p>
<p t="2731760" d="3840">Here's pathology as conceptualized by the phenomenologists</p>
<p t="2736180" d="2355">It's a very interesting way of thinking about it</p>
<p t="2738535" d="3140">Existential guilt and fear as debt to possibility</p>
<p t="2741680" d="1820">Well so there's this idea</p>
<p t="2743500" d="2980">It's like an exisitential idea that you have some problems</p>
<p t="2747040" d="1920">That you have some problems in your life</p>
<p t="2748960" d="5920">Well part of the Dasein is the sense of responsibility that you have to address those problems</p>
<p t="2754940" d="3760">It's part and parcel of the way that human beings manifest themselves in the world</p>
<p t="2758700" d="5060">So part of your pathology would be failure to bear the responsibility for your being</p>
<p t="2763760" d="2380">And a sense that you have a debt to your existence</p>
<p t="2766340" d="3780">And according to the phenomenologists that's built right into the sense of your being</p>
<p t="2774760" d="2480">It's a remarkable conceptualization</p>
<p t="2781095" d="3160">Right well that's a good place to stop</p>
<p t="2784255" d="2950">Okay good we'll see you in a week and a half</p>
