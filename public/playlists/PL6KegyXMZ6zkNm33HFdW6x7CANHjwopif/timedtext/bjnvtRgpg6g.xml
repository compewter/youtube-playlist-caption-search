<p t="2429" d="8440">So, welcome to Maps of Meaning. So the first
question I guess I might have is, what, why</p>
<p t="10869" d="9061">are you here? Anybody got an interesting reason?
>>[Student answers: Uh, I want to be able</p>
<p t="19930" d="4480">to manipulate reality to my best interests.]
>>That's a good plan.</p>
<p t="24410" d="570">>>[Student answers: Yeah.]</p>
<p t="24980" d="1870">>>Except for the manipulate part.
[Laughter]</p>
<p t="26850" d="4360">>>[Student answers: Maybe my wording is off?]
>>It's okay.</p>
<p t="31210" d="4390">>>It's better to work with reality, generally,
than to manipulate it cause it tends to hit</p>
<p t="35600" d="4640">back. Anyone else? Yeah.
>>[Student answers: Uhh, my friend took this</p>
<p t="40400" d="2920">class a couple years ago and he kind of threatened
me to take it.]</p>
<p t="43540" d="1140">>>Oh yeah.</p>
<p t="44680" d="2120">>>[Student answers: Cause apparently he said
that the course actually changes likeï¿½]</p>
<p t="46800" d="2260">>>For the, for the better?
>>[Student answers: Yeah.]</p>
<p t="49060" d="1760">[Students' laughter]
>>That's good.</p>
<p t="50820" d="2660">>>[Student answers: You made him write a short
story or something, and made him want to become</p>
<p t="53580" d="1880">an author. Now he's a published author.]
>>Really?</p>
<p t="55660" d="1240">>>[Student: Yeah]
>>Is he any good?</p>
<p t="56900" d="1680">>>[Student answers: I never read his book
actually.]</p>
<p t="58580" d="620">[Students' laughter]</p>
<p t="59200" d="3340">>>Ooh. Some friend you are. No wonder he threatens
you. Yeah.</p>
<p t="62540" d="5300">>>[Student answers: I audited this course
six years ago, and the course changed the</p>
<p t="67850" d="3010">way I see the world. So I want to see after
six years what happens now.]</p>
<p t="70869" d="2800">>>You want to see if it'll change back?
[Students' laughter]</p>
<p t="73669" d="2011">Well that's good.</p>
<p t="75680" d="3580">So why did you decide, why, uh, why after
all this time did you decide to come back?</p>
<p t="79260" d="3120">>>[Student answers: Well I thought about the
things you discussed in the class over those</p>
<p t="82380" d="3200">six years, but now, um, it's been awhile and
I want to refresh myself and see, you know,</p>
<p t="85590" d="7010">with the new experience I've had, and the
new things I've learned, how and what I can</p>
<p t="92600" d="2640">take from it now.]
>>Hmm, hmm. Well that's very, um, dedicated</p>
<p t="95240" d="989">and hopefully useful.</p>
<p t="96229" d="4021">>>[Student answers: My friend said that he
had a spiritual awakening from taking this</p>
<p t="100250" d="4189">course.]
>>God, I hope I didn't see that. He did, eh?</p>
<p t="104439" d="3470">>>[Student: Yeah]
>>Did he give you any, any, like, any, description</p>
<p t="107909" d="5350">or? Was it associated with an epileptic seizure?
[Students' laughter]</p>
<p t="113259" d="4120">>>[Student: It was associated with a lot of
like, visions]</p>
<p t="117380" d="3699">>>Oh really, eh? Oh that's interesting. Yeah
that can get out of hand, that sort of thing,</p>
<p t="121079" d="3500">you know. No, that's, that's interesting.
I mean, one of the things that I experienced</p>
<p t="124579" d="3411">when I started to learn some of the things
that I'm going to talk to you guys about is</p>
<p t="127990" d="6069">a very radical increase in the intensity and
clarity of my dreams. It wasn't pleasant,</p>
<p t="134059" d="7660">by the way. But, it was useful. Most useful
things aren't that pleasant. So you're in</p>
<p t="141719" d="3630">for some of the same punishment, I guess that's
the plan, is it?</p>
<p t="145349" d="680">[Student answers]</p>
<p t="146029" d="7520">>>Alright, alright, anybody else?
>>[Student answers: I sort of have an independent</p>
<p t="153560" d="6900">interest in Existential Psychology. Nietzsche,
Jung, etc. This seemed like a good place to</p>
<p t="160460" d="3600">discuss it, and I took your previous class,
personality.]</p>
<p t="164069" d="840">Personality?
>>[Student answers: I liked it a lot.]</p>
<p t="164909" d="2700">>>When did you take that?
>>[Student answers: Couple years ago.]</p>
<p t="167609" d="5240">>>Yeah? Yeah, well it's a good preparation
for this class. Now, is there anybody here</p>
<p t="172849" d="4021">who doesn't have any idea what this class
is about, and more or less showed up because</p>
<p t="176870" d="4569">the time is right or anything like that? So
you don't really have any idea what you're</p>
<p t="181439" d="2600">in for?</p>
<p t="184040" d="5280">[Student answers]</p>
<p t="189329" d="6480">Alright, well I'm gonna jump right into it
because why not? So I'm gonna talk to you</p>
<p t="195809" d="3380">for about two hours, and then you can have
a break, and then I'm gonna tell you what</p>
<p t="199189" d="4860">you have to do in the class. But, by that
time you'll know if you wanna take the class</p>
<p t="204049" d="3571">because you'll know whether or not you were
interested in what I told you about. So I'm</p>
<p t="207620" d="5209">going to video the class - I always do that.
So the videos will be online, ones from previous</p>
<p t="212829" d="5920">years are online as well. So hopefully that'll
be a useful resource. It shouldn't take me</p>
<p t="218749" d="5940">as much setup time the next time as it did
me today. I'm still getting used to this equipment.</p>
<p t="224689" d="9080">So, I wanna tell you why I'm telling you the
things that I'm going to tell you. When I</p>
<p t="234000" d="7540">was approximately the same age that you people
are, probably a little bit older as I imagine</p>
<p t="241540" d="5039">you guys are around 21 or something like that.
I was probably about your age and a couple</p>
<p t="246579" d="4170">years older. First year I was in graduate
school, in particular, which I guess was in</p>
<p t="250749" d="4151">1985, so I was 23 then.</p>
<p t="254900" d="7179">That was in 1985, and there are a couple of
times in the late 20th century where the Cold</p>
<p t="262079" d="7351">War really came to a peak. And one time, I
guess, was probably in about 1957 when, I</p>
<p t="269430" d="4930">think it was 57. I hope I have my dates right.
Whenever Stalin announced that he had developed</p>
<p t="274360" d="5589">a hydrogen bomb, and I don't know how much
you guys know about hydrogen bombs, but all</p>
<p t="279949" d="6761">you really need to know about a hydrogen bomb
is that they use atom bombs as a trigger.</p>
<p t="286710" d="9199">So they're quite the weapon, and the USSR
and the US made some very, very big ones.</p>
<p t="295909" d="3931">They're big enough to make the thing that
was dropped on Hiroshima look like dynamite.</p>
<p t="299840" d="6879">So, hundreds and hundreds of times bigger
- maybe thousands of times. It's been awhile</p>
<p t="306719" d="1790">since I looked into it.</p>
<p t="308509" d="6491">And then in 1962, there was the Cuban Missile
Crisis - I have a good story about that. So,</p>
<p t="315000" d="7979">about ten years ago, I went down to Tucson,
Arizona to a conference on consciousness there.</p>
<p t="322979" d="5951">And they have that conference fairly frequently
in Tucson. It's become quite a popular conference</p>
<p t="328930" d="2880">even though it isn't clear to me that we know
anything more about consciousness than we</p>
<p t="331810" d="6050">did before the conference started. And, Tucson's
kind of an interesting town. It's in the middle</p>
<p t="337860" d="8380">of the desert, the cool desert, with the big
sort of Saguaro road runner cactuses. But</p>
<p t="346240" d="3090">it's also extremely dry there which is, of
course, what you'd expect given that it's</p>
<p t="349330" d="4809">a desert. So one of the things that Americans
do with Tucson is store old fighter planes</p>
<p t="354139" d="5661">there. And so there is an airplane museum,
which is an amazing place. It has maybe 500</p>
<p t="359800" d="5079">planes including John F Kennedy's Air Force
One, which is the jet that he used to zoom</p>
<p t="364879" d="2731">around the world - it didn't have a shower
by the way.</p>
<p t="367610" d="3420">It's funny because on the outside it looked
like a modern jet, but on the inside, it looked</p>
<p t="371030" d="6340">pretty much like it was from World War Two
because 1962 is a lot closer to World War</p>
<p t="377370" d="4799">Two than it is it now, in all sorts of ways.
Even the rockets that went to the moon looked</p>
<p t="382169" d="4171">like they were built by people who were using
World War Two technology - they were full</p>
<p t="386340" d="9199">switches, mechanical switches, and it's pretty
basic. Anyways, as well as the airport museum,</p>
<p t="395539" d="3560">which is a very interesting place - there's
B-52 bombers there and all sorts of things.</p>
<p t="399099" d="4181">Those things are huge. There's also an airport
graveyard where they store old fighter jets</p>
<p t="403280" d="5046">and there's a lot of old fighter jets so there's
acres, and acres, and acres, and thousands</p>
<p t="408520" d="5220">and thousands of old mothballed fighter jets
lined up in the desert. So that's kind of</p>
<p t="413740" d="5479">cool in a strange way, but there was one other
thing down there that I went and saw which</p>
<p t="419219" d="6630">was a decommissioned nuclear missile site
and it was an intercontinental ballistic missile</p>
<p t="425849" d="5761">site and those were built in the fifties and
early sixties, and they were major league</p>
<p t="431610" d="7410">rockets, those things. I think the silo, cause
we could go into the silo, and it was certainly</p>
<p t="439020" d="3369">farther across in diameter than this room.</p>
<p t="442599" d="5160">I would think probably twice as large as this
room, so you can imagine how big a missile</p>
<p t="447759" d="4680">that would be - it's not your grandmother's
missile. It's a major league piece of armament,</p>
<p t="452439" d="4560">and out on the grounds - these things were
underground, deep underground, because they</p>
<p t="456999" d="5290">didn't want them to get blown up if they were
bombed, so they buried them quite a long ways</p>
<p t="462289" d="4611">down and to get into it, you had to go through
this massive steel door that was like a huge</p>
<p t="466900" d="7049">safe door except, you know ten times as big,
and ten times as thick. Out in the yard of</p>
<p t="473949" d="5131">the nuclear missile site, there were fences
with barbed wire on them of course, and there</p>
<p t="479080" d="5839">was a missile cap. It'd be the nose cone of
the missile. Some of these missiles had single</p>
<p t="484919" d="5541">warheads, which were more than sufficient
to demolish a city and some of them had multiple</p>
<p t="490460" d="4729">warheads, so they would shoot out into space
and then come back into Earth and then they</p>
<p t="495189" d="4160">essentialy break apart or disperse into multiple
missiles and then you can really bomb the</p>
<p t="499349" d="4451">hell out of whatever you were going to bomb
instead of just destroying one city.</p>
<p t="503800" d="3489">And so, the nose cone was sitting out there
and that was a pretty freaky looking thing,</p>
<p t="507289" d="5740">I'll tell you. Like it was big. It was about
seven feet high I would think, and maybe about</p>
<p t="513029" d="5091">the same amount across. It was made of this
plastic, kind of variegated plastic material</p>
<p t="518120" d="4729">that was about three-quarters of an inch thick
and then it would melt off, of course, on</p>
<p t="522849" d="5860">re-entry because as I said these things shot
out into space, and so that was kind of unnerving</p>
<p t="528709" d="5990">really, in a serious way. So we're at the
missile site and you know, I mentioned your</p>
<p t="534699" d="4021">grandmother's missile. There was actually
a reason for that. It was a bit of foreshadowing</p>
<p t="538720" d="4700">because it was a very funny place because
at the front of the missile site there was</p>
<p t="543420" d="5570">sort of this museum set up, you know, and
it had pictures of Reagan and Gorbachev on</p>
<p t="548990" d="4926">it because they decommissioned the missile
sites when detente occurred and then when</p>
<p t="554250" d="3940">Perestroika hit, and the Soviet Union started
to collapse, and so there were all these pictures</p>
<p t="558190" d="5750">of Reagan and Gorbachev from 1984 and so the
museum was kind of like a time capsule of</p>
<p t="563940" d="6220">1984, and the people who were running it were,
like, retired Arizonans. And they were like</p>
<p t="570160" d="4000">your grandparents, assuming you have retired
Arizonans for your grandparents.</p>
<p t="574160" d="5229">But they're real friendly and they're pretty
happy to show you their nuclear missile museum</p>
<p t="579389" d="3431">and it was sort of like being in their rec
room, except that it was a nuclear missile</p>
<p t="582820" d="6259">site and they were hospitable and it was weird,
you know. It's like welcome to - you don't</p>
<p t="589079" d="5380">welcome people to a nuclear missile site.
It's just not reasonable and so it was very</p>
<p t="594459" d="4630">disconcerting and it was disconcerting that
it was locked in the 1980's and then it was</p>
<p t="599089" d="3951">disconcerting that it was friendly and hospitable
and, you know they were kind of proud to show</p>
<p t="603040" d="6419">it off and happy to be there, and then when
you went down into the nuclear missile silo</p>
<p t="609459" d="6511">proper - the control center, it's sort of
like Star Trek, you know, from 1966 or 1967</p>
<p t="615970" d="8260">except more primitive. I don't remember if
the Star Trek control command area was modeled</p>
<p t="624230" d="5560">after the nuclear missile site control systems
or if it was the other way around but I suspect</p>
<p t="629790" d="5969">it was that they were modeled after the nuclear
controls but that was really 1950's - like</p>
<p t="635759" d="4351">the whole place was painted in that pastel
green that, you know, late fifties and early</p>
<p t="640110" d="1550">sixties people really liked.</p>
<p t="641660" d="6130">And it had this 1950's - what would you call
it - aesthetic. And you wouldn't necessarily</p>
<p t="647790" d="3750">think that a nuclear missile site would have
an aesthetic but it does, and it looked like</p>
<p t="651540" d="8090">high tech 1957 technology. So they brought
you into the control room and the control</p>
<p t="659630" d="4139">desk was probably - or the module or whatever you might
call it - was about three times as long as</p>
<p t="663769" d="5240">this - maybe four times. It was a pretty impressive
piece of machinery and the way you launch</p>
<p t="669009" d="6211">the missiles was not too secure in my humble
opinion. What happened was, one guy wore the</p>
<p t="675220" d="3510">key around his neck. And then another guy wore the key around his neck.</p>
<p t="678730" d="4279">In order to launch the sites, you had to put
the keys in the same time, and they were far</p>
<p t="683009" d="4471">enough apart so nobody could stretch their
arms, you know, which was kind of the high-tech</p>
<p t="687480" d="6070">part of it. So, and, he had to put a key in,
and you both had to turn the key for 10 seconds.</p>
<p t="693550" d="5140">Okay, so, and one thing you may know about
ballistic missiles or you may not, is they're</p>
<p t="698690" d="4670">not cruise missiles. Once you set those things
off, they're not coming back. They're bullets.</p>
<p t="703360" d="3370">That's what makes them ballistic. You know,
if you aim a gun at someone and you shoot,</p>
<p t="706730" d="6120">and you decide halfway, when the bullet's halfway
there, maybe that wasn't a good thing to do,</p>
<p t="712850" d="3989">it's a little late because you're not telling
that bullet to come back.</p>
<p t="716839" d="3860">And it's the same with ballistic missiles,
and those things are going a lot faster than</p>
<p t="720699" d="7231">bullets, you know, like a 22 bullet goes about
the speed of sound, but a ballistic missile,</p>
<p t="727930" d="3880">that thing has to go around 7 miles a second
to get out of the gravity o f the earth. Now</p>
<p t="731810" d="4339">i'm not sure they go quite that fast because
that's escape velocity right, You need to do</p>
<p t="736149" d="3831">that to get out of the gravitational well.
But to get out there into space, you have</p>
<p t="739980" d="5330">to be damn close to 7 miles a second. So it's
a bullet, a very large bullet with a very</p>
<p t="745310" d="5863">explosive head on it going 7 miles a second.
And once you turn those two keys man, that's</p>
<p t="751529" d="5341">it. There's no turning back. That's that.
And so they took us through a simulated launch</p>
<p t="756870" d="6560">which still kind of, it's still an uncanny
feeling remembering that, you know, because</p>
<p t="763430" d="7529">it's a hell of a thing to apprehend. And then
they told us that the keys were in once. Right.</p>
<p t="770959" d="4651">So we were ten seconds away. Now they wouldn't
tell us when, but we know when. It was during</p>
<p t="775610" d="1570">the cuban missile crisis.</p>
<p t="777180" d="5920">So, you know, there are a couple of times
in the latter part of the 20th century, where</p>
<p t="783100" d="7479">we made it through the eye of a needle, we
barely bloody well made it. And, the cuban</p>
<p t="790579" d="3981">missile crisis was one of those points. But
in the early 80's, things were heating up</p>
<p t="794560" d="5579">pretty badly too. In about 1984, there was
a movie that came out, called The Day After.</p>
<p t="800139" d="4200">You guys probably don't know about The Day
After. But it was the most watched movie that</p>
<p t="804339" d="5680">had ever been broadcast on TV at that point.
And basically what it showed was, what a city</p>
<p t="810019" d="6951">would be like, the day after the United States
had been bombed into total desolation by a</p>
<p t="816970" d="4960">Soviet missile attack. And you know, it was
a pretty hair raising movie. And one of the</p>
<p t="821930" d="3519">things that was quite interesting about it
was that Ronald Reagan later said that he</p>
<p t="825449" d="3940">watched that movie and that was actually part
of the reason that he entered into Detente</p>
<p t="829389" d="2700">talks with the Soviets.</p>
<p t="832089" d="5300">Now you know, Reagan had been basically been
scaring the hell out of the Soviets. He had</p>
<p t="837389" d="3640">called them an evil empire, which the liberals
weren't very happy about, but the Soviets</p>
<p t="841029" d="5221">man, they were an evil empire. There's absolutely
no doubt about it. It's not obvious how many</p>
<p t="846250" d="5629">people the soviets killed, during their Communist
Revolution and years following that. But the</p>
<p t="851879" d="5591">estimates range from twenty to sixty million.
Now that's a lot of people. Like even if it's</p>
<p t="857470" d="4659">twenty million, that's three times as many
people as were killed in the holocaust. You</p>
<p t="862129" d="5561">know, the Soviets starved six million Ukrainians
in the 1930s and that was just to get warmed</p>
<p t="867690" d="6410">up. So the idea that the Soviets were an evil
empire, it's like, it's a strong word, but</p>
<p t="874100" d="3640">there's absolutely no doubt that it was true
and the more we learn about what happened,</p>
<p t="877740" d="5860">especially during the Stalinist period, although
Lenin was no picnic. He pretty much created</p>
<p t="883600" d="2739">the Stalinist monster that followed him.</p>
<p t="886339" d="6800">The more we learn about it, the more horrible
it becomes. And the Soviet system was operated,</p>
<p t="893139" d="5551">the economy fundamentally ran on slave labor,
for what economy there was. What happened</p>
<p t="898690" d="4280">with Reagan in part was, first of all the
soviet union was falling apart because there's</p>
<p t="902970" d="5340">just so long you can keep a sinking ship afloat.
And something that big can die twenty years</p>
<p t="908310" d="8029">before it falls over. A system like that can
stumble along half-gutted and still manage.</p>
<p t="916339" d="3086">And so, by the time Reagan had come along,
the thing had probably pretty much burned</p>
<p t="919649" d="4930">itself out as a consequence of internal contradictions.
But he ramped up american military spending</p>
<p t="924579" d="5000">to a staggering degree. And part of the idea
behind that, at least that's what the Republicans</p>
<p t="929579" d="3200">would have everyone believe, and that might
be true, is that they're just going to spend</p>
<p t="932779" d="5300">the Russians right into bankruptcy - and they
basically did, and so that was that for the</p>
<p t="938079" d="4440">Soviet Union and it fell over in 1989 which
was like, that was a good day. That was a</p>
<p t="942519" d="4680">really good day, and the weird thing is that
no one saw it coming. And that was shocking.</p>
<p t="947209" d="6423">One day the Soviet Union was there and the
next day, the SU was gone. And there was gone</p>
<p t="953860" d="3919">CIA analysts that said hey yea, they're about
ready to crumble, you just have to blow on</p>
<p t="957779" d="2730">them and they'll fall over. It was a shock
to everyone.</p>
<p t="960509" d="4390">You know, and then, it was very iffy in the
aftermath whether or not it would hold. Yeltsin,</p>
<p t="964899" d="4620">who was a terrible drunkard, but actually
a pretty courageous, well he was russian,</p>
<p t="969519" d="6670">you know. He was a pretty courageous guy and
he faced down reestablishment by the totalitarians</p>
<p t="976189" d="5551">on a tank. You know, that was good for him
because that was pretty frightening too. Anyways</p>
<p t="981740" d="7294">I'm telling you all this because when I grew
up, most of the people I knew were convinced</p>
<p t="989300" d="5000">that there was no bloody way we were going
to make it to the 20th century. You know,</p>
<p t="994300" d="6380">and I think, I remember discussing this with
all of my friends frequently, and you know</p>
<p t="1000680" d="3139">some people kind of use that as an excuse,
you know like what the hell's the point, you</p>
<p t="1003819" d="4781">know, we're gonna blow ourselves up anyway
so i might as well drink vodka until i fall</p>
<p t="1008600" d="3940">over. And you know, that's not really a particularly
moral way of looking at it, but I'm telling</p>
<p t="1012540" d="7539">you that there was no shortage of thinking
that this was so insane that this would certainly</p>
<p t="1020079" d="1781">end in absolute catastrophe.</p>
<p t="1021860" d="5320">And it damn near did, like it wasn't some
kind of collective delusion. You know, there</p>
<p t="1027180" d="5940">were times, in fact, there was a story recently
published, about a russian general who was</p>
<p t="1033120" d="6000">given the order to launch the missiles. There
was a mistake in reading on their display,</p>
<p t="1039120" d="4420">showing that missiles were coming from north
america across the poles towards russia, and</p>
<p t="1043540" d="7190">he was told to launch, but he didn't. Well,
good for him, but, that's a little too close.</p>
<p t="1050730" d="4200">Really. And you know, there's all sorts of
other crazy things that had happened during</p>
<p t="1054930" d="1070">that period of time.</p>
<p t="1056000" d="6540">So for example, I read this book by an ex-KGB
guy who said he worked in a biological warfare</p>
<p t="1062540" d="5520">lab in the soviet union. They killed a number
of people by accident when some of their bugs</p>
<p t="1068060" d="5290">got out, on the order of 500 people, which
is a lot of people, but it's not like 250,000</p>
<p t="1073350" d="4830">people. But it's a lot of people. But what
those geniuses were trying to do was cross</p>
<p t="1078180" d="9970">ebola with smallpox. So small pox is unbelieveably
- the combination of smallpox and ebola is</p>
<p t="1088150" d="6050">extraordinarily easy to transmit and very
very very fatal. And so, they were trying</p>
<p t="1094200" d="4903">to cross it and then aerosolize it so you
could distribute it in canisters and blow</p>
<p t="1099410" d="6500">it over cities. Nice bit of scientific investigation.
Perfectly reasonable scientific question - can</p>
<p t="1105910" d="1390">it be done?</p>
<p t="1107300" d="8530">So, you know, it was a pretty crazy period
of time. And all human history - what did</p>
<p t="1115830" d="3550">Dostoevsky say about human history? The one
thing you can say about it is that it's not</p>
<p t="1119380" d="5530">rational. The very word sticks in your throat,
so it's always been crazy, and it's crazy</p>
<p t="1124910" d="5190">now, but it was really crazy then. And so,
we got through that, and thank god, you know,</p>
<p t="1130100" d="4290">as far as I'm concerned, the world is a lot
better place now than it was, well it is,</p>
<p t="1134390" d="4330">thirty years ago, forty years ago, fifty years
ago. Things are way better now, you know,</p>
<p t="1138720" d="6670">you hear a lot of doom and gloom about how
we're gonna destroy the planet, but we probably</p>
<p t="1145390" d="7920">aren't. The population is gonna stabilize
out at around 9 billion. We already have 7,</p>
<p t="1153310" d="2380">we can handle another 2.</p>
<p t="1155690" d="5990">There's gonna be some extinctions - we're
eating up the ocean like insane piranha - that's</p>
<p t="1161680" d="4380">mostly a fault of public policy, but it looks
like we're probably gonna squeak through the</p>
<p t="1166060" d="4300">century with a bit of damage and then things
are gonna settle down. It's highly probable</p>
<p t="1170360" d="4110">if theres anything vaguely human left in a
hundred years, that the big problem will be</p>
<p t="1174470" d="4440">population is rapidly decreasing. And that's
already happening in european countries, it's</p>
<p t="1178910" d="5080">happening in japan, it's going to happen in
china. And so you know, by the year 2100,</p>
<p t="1183990" d="4690">the most populous country in the world is
going to be nigeria, not china. China is going</p>
<p t="1188680" d="4280">to lose people like mad, because they have
a one child policy. And everybody in china</p>
<p t="1192960" d="6300">is getting old, so it's not going to be hyper
populated. Anyways, so I was interested in</p>
<p t="1199260" d="5100">all this because i had felt I'd grown up - I
didn't feel like I'd grown up under its shadow</p>
<p t="1204360" d="2080">- I had grown up under its shadow.</p>
<p t="1206440" d="3680">It was something in the back of our minds
all the time. And there was a question underneath</p>
<p t="1210120" d="8920">that, a couple of them, and one was - how
is this possible? How could it be that the</p>
<p t="1219040" d="5660">world could divide itself up into two armed
camps - hyper armed camps - tens of thousands</p>
<p t="1224700" d="4850">of nuclear missiles, more than enough to wipe
out the enemy many times over. I don't remember</p>
<p t="1229550" d="3710">what the american arsenal peaked out, but
i think it was more than fifty thousand nuclear</p>
<p t="1233260" d="5070">weapons. I dont know if theres fifty thousand
towns in the Soviet Union. Maybe they were</p>
<p t="1238330" d="4920">gonna bomb Moscow fifty times or something,
but after the first two or three, it's probably</p>
<p t="1243250" d="6660">more or less irrelevant. So it was really,
it was really crazy. And I don't know if you</p>
<p t="1249910" d="5440">know this, but - and I believe this was during
the Kennedy era, I hope I got this right.</p>
<p t="1255350" d="4810">One of kennedy's genius boys came up with
the - because kennedy's administration was</p>
<p t="1260160" d="3970">run by a lot of harvard graduates and a lot
of ivy league graduates so they were supposed</p>
<p t="1264130" d="5630">to be pretty intelligent, but intelligence
and wisdom are not the same thing. Anyways,</p>
<p t="1269760" d="4730">they established a policy which was called
Mutual Assured Destruction, which means if</p>
<p t="1274490" d="5500">you hit me, I kill you, and then you kill
me so it would be better if we didn't bother.</p>
<p t="1279990" d="7800">And the acronym was MAD - Mutual Assured Destruction.
It's like, you know just thinking about that,</p>
<p t="1287790" d="7000">it's a chilling thought - it's like what horrible
entity thought that up as a joke. You know</p>
<p t="1294790" d="6730">you think well is that some politicians idea
as wit? Where'd that come from? So thats a</p>
<p t="1301520" d="4690">hell of a thing to make a joke about. MAD.
Well that was right, it was definitely mad.</p>
<p t="1306210" d="4980">And you know the odd thing is that we didnt
blow ourselves up and we didnt have a third</p>
<p t="1311190" d="7030">world war, and you can't make a solid claim
the invention of nuclear weapons was necessarily</p>
<p t="1318220" d="5140">the worst thing that could've happened because
even the soviets who were completely insane,</p>
<p t="1323360" d="4400">and of course the Maoists who were probably
even worse, they weren't insane enough to</p>
<p t="1327760" d="1850">start a nuclear war.</p>
<p t="1329610" d="6430">Now Stalin, there's evidence - there's debate
about it - but there's evidence that stalin</p>
<p t="1336040" d="7840">was basically murdered, partly by Khrushchev,
who was his successor. When Stalin died, Khrushchev</p>
<p t="1343880" d="3840">and three other people were in his house and
what happened the night stalin had died is</p>
<p t="1347720" d="5291">not clear. But i read a book recently called
Stalin, interestingly enough, that was</p>
<p t="1353230" d="4640">written by a guy who had access to the full
Communist party archives, which was a relatively</p>
<p t="1357870" d="6037">new thing, and that was his conclusion. He
also believed Stalin was gearing up to do</p>
<p t="1363907" d="3234">an invasion of Europe, and that he didn't
give a damn about how many cities would have</p>
<p t="1367430" d="5820">to be bombed in order for the soviets to roll
through. And Stalin, he was like that.</p>
<p t="1373250" d="4500">Stalin was perfectly capable of taking entire
nations of people out in Eastern Europe by</p>
<p t="1377750" d="4480">train and shipping them out to Siberia in
the middle of winter with nothing to eat and</p>
<p t="1382230" d="5529">no tools and letting them live, which of course
they didnt - and that meant women, and children,</p>
<p t="1388110" d="6040">and men shorn of all their belongings and
thrust out into the middle of nowhere to perish</p>
<p t="1394150" d="5630">or live as they saw fit. And if they perished,
so much the better, as far as Stalin was concerned.</p>
<p t="1399780" d="5750">He wasn't exactly the sort of person the idea
of nuclear war would necessarily stop, and</p>
<p t="1405530" d="5140">it's certainly possible that's what he was
hoping for because when we look at people</p>
<p t="1410670" d="5950">like Stalin and Hitler, we think they're after
world domination. You think in some sense</p>
<p t="1416620" d="6450">that's kind of a positive motivation - not
really - but it's like if you have a Corvette</p>
<p t="1423070" d="3500">and someone steals it, you can think well
I know why they stole it, they wanted to have</p>
<p t="1426570" d="7130">the Corvette! It's an understandable motivation
to want power, it's not necessarily an admirable</p>
<p t="1433700" d="5670">one, but sometimes power is a perfectly reasonable
thing to pursue. But, I don't have any idea</p>
<p t="1439370" d="3790">why we ever assumed that those guys were after
victory.</p>
<p t="1443160" d="4790">You should never make the presupposition that
everyone is out to win - some people are out</p>
<p t="1447950" d="5180">to lose, and the more people they take with
them, the better. When Hitler died, he committed</p>
<p t="1453130" d="4980">suicide in a bunker way down below in Berlin,
when Berlin was on fire and Europe was burning.</p>
<p t="1458110" d="5150">And as far as I can tell, that was what Hitler
was after from the very beginning. He was</p>
<p t="1463260" d="3290">interested in fire as a purifying agent.</p>
<p t="1466550" d="4620">He's a fire worshipper in some sense, because
if you look at the Nuremberg gatherings of</p>
<p t="1471170" d="6700">the Nazis, they were spectacular, spectacular
celebrations - unbelievably dramatic and impressive,</p>
<p t="1477870" d="5500">and they frequently featured fire. And fire
is a purifying agent, and Hitler, by the end</p>
<p t="1483370" d="5830">of WW2, he was pretty contemptuous of the
Germans because they really hadn't served</p>
<p t="1489200" d="5120">him well. Now, it wasn't like he thought maybe
it wasn't such a good idea to start a whole</p>
<p t="1494320" d="3410">second world war, because he was a little
on the narcissistic side you might say.</p>
<p t="1497730" d="5730">But by the time the Russians came marching
in and Germany was in ruins, Hitler was perfectly</p>
<p t="1503460" d="4300">happy to have the allies tromp all over the
citizens, because that's what they deserved</p>
<p t="1507760" d="4500">anyways. And so, that's the sort of guy he
was, and so, why we would assume he wanted</p>
<p t="1512260" d="5060">to win just because that's what he said is
something I've never been able to understand.</p>
<p t="1517320" d="4230">The kids who shot up Columbine didnt want
to win, they wanted to kill as many people</p>
<p t="1521550" d="3700">as possible to make a point, and then they
wanted to kill themselves - just in case you</p>
<p t="1525250" d="4990">didnt exactly get the point. And the point
was: the more destruction, the better, and</p>
<p t="1530240" d="4730">if i have to go along with it, hey no problem,
that just makes me a little more serious than</p>
<p t="1534970" d="7030">i'd otherwise been. Those sort of motivations
are not pleasant to understand. We have enough</p>
<p t="1542000" d="4990">documentation about events like that, especially
the mass killings. Those guys have written</p>
<p t="1546990" d="7610">down exactly why they do it. I have some excellent
books on extraordinarily vengeful serial killers</p>
<p t="1554600" d="4930">and mass murderers. I know exactly how they
think.There's a great book on this sort of</p>
<p t="1559530" d="4490">thing, if you're interested in this sort of
thing called Panzram.</p>
<p t="1564020" d="6000">And Carl Panzram was a serial killer and rapist
who lived pretty much early in the 20th century.</p>
<p t="1570020" d="6030">He was a tough, delinquency sort of kid, from
a large family. When he was 13, 14, they sent</p>
<p t="1576050" d="4940">him off to some reform school. It was run
by the same sort of people that had run Canada's</p>
<p t="1580990" d="5520">residential schools. So you know, they were
basically predators on children. And of course,</p>
<p t="1586510" d="7160">he was raped, and brutalized, and tormented
in all sorts of horrible ways, but he was</p>
<p t="1593670" d="4940">a tough guy. When he came out, he decided
the human race wasn't really worth that much</p>
<p t="1598610" d="4700">and that he was going to wreak as much mayhem
as he possibly could for the rest of his life.</p>
<p t="1603310" d="6160">He raped a thousand men. He killed dozens
of people. He kept track of the dollar value</p>
<p t="1609470" d="7980">of the buildings he burned down. Like, this
was a serious guy. He was bent on destruction.</p>
<p t="1617450" d="1680">And that's that.</p>
<p t="1619130" d="5470">What were his dying words? First of all, there
was a committee, I believe of women, that</p>
<p t="1624600" d="6620">intervened on behalf of him, cause they were
anti-capital punishment, and he said to them,</p>
<p t="1631220" d="3820">if I remember correctly, that he wished the
human race had one neck so he could put his</p>
<p t="1635040" d="5780">hands around it and squeeze. So that was his
way of pointing out to the people who didn't</p>
<p t="1640820" d="4510">think that capital punishment was justified
in his case, that they maybe weren't thinking</p>
<p t="1645330" d="4800">clearly. Then to the hangman, he said hurry
up, you hoosier bastard. I could kill ten</p>
<p t="1650130" d="5360">men in the time it takes you to kill me.
You don't get a statement like that from someone</p>
<p t="1655490" d="7460">who isn't thoroughly committed to what he's
doing. So, the situation in the world found</p>
<p t="1662950" d="4790">itself involved in really had me thinking.
Part of it was well, what the hell's going</p>
<p t="1667740" d="4360">on with all these weapons, and how can it
possibly be anyone thinks that's a reasonable</p>
<p t="1672100" d="5140">solution. How did it come about that this
could even occur, and what are we thinking.</p>
<p t="1677240" d="5490">There's that, and there was also the why are
people so damn convinced on either side of</p>
<p t="1682730" d="5160">this argument that they're right enough to
risk everything for - which is a perfectly</p>
<p t="1687890" d="2710">good question.
And then there was the malevolence issue,</p>
<p t="1690600" d="5100">with how much of this was wanting to see your
side win and everything to do with wanting</p>
<p t="1695700" d="3150">to see everything lose. And then</p>
<p t="1698850" d="15550">And then 
there was another issue which was, well are
both sides wrong? Are both sides right? Because</p>
<p t="1714400" d="3430">that's more of a cultural relativist approach
because yeah, yeah, the Communists believe</p>
<p t="1717830" d="4460">one thing and the bloody capitalists believe
another and they're just as bad. Who believes</p>
<p t="1722290" d="4420">what is completely arbitrary because belief
systems are arbitrary, and so maybe they're</p>
<p t="1726710" d="3940">both right or they're both wrong. I thought
well, either of those conclusions were pretty</p>
<p t="1730650" d="4670">damn dismal because well, if they're both
right, what are you gonna do? Have them talk</p>
<p t="1735320" d="4830">it out? I don't think so. And if they're both
wrong, that's not much better. And then if</p>
<p t="1740150" d="5230">one's right and the other's wrong - well does
that mean anything? Like is it possible for</p>
<p t="1745380" d="4710">one belief system to be more right than another
belief system because of course, that's certainly</p>
<p t="1750090" d="5560">not a tenet of moral relativism, and you might
think of that as the standard intellectual</p>
<p t="1755650" d="4550">approach to morality, and has been for the
past hundred years. I think, by the way, that</p>
<p t="1760200" d="2260">that's a reprehensible morality.</p>
<p t="1762460" d="8020">I'll tell you why, as we move through the
course because one of the things I tried to</p>
<p t="1770480" d="5600">find out was was what we were fighting for
- assuming you give the West a bit of a benefit</p>
<p t="1776080" d="4400">of the doubt and assume that some of the things
we stand for, we actually stand for and we</p>
<p t="1780480" d="8250">aren't just posturing, parading - grounded
in anything? Or was it just arbitrary opinion?</p>
<p t="1788730" d="5790">So, that's what we're going to talk about.
We're going to talk about why people believe</p>
<p t="1794520" d="9080">the things they believe. What psychological
function does belief perform. We're going</p>
<p t="1803600" d="5510">to talk about malevolence. As far as I can
tell, malevolence is the willingness to do</p>
<p t="1809110" d="5470">evil, and I think the best definition of evil
- and I've thought about this for a long time,</p>
<p t="1814580" d="6250">like what constitutes evil, and it's complicated
- but I think if you want a one line summary,</p>
<p t="1820830" d="5120">it's the desire to do harm for the sake of
the harm. So you have to think about it as</p>
<p t="1825950" d="1910">a kind of art form.</p>
<p t="1827860" d="4490">Look. If you have a terrorist and you think
he's hidden an atom bomb in the stadium, and</p>
<p t="1832350" d="3140">you think well, he's not gonna tell me - you
have good evidence - he's not gonna tell me</p>
<p t="1835490" d="4263">unless I torture him. I don't think you should
torture him because torture is wrong. But you</p>
<p t="1840100" d="4350">know, if you do that and you really believe
he's hidden an atom bomb in a stadium, at</p>
<p t="1844450" d="3370">least you have some justification for what
you're doing and it's not necessarily that</p>
<p t="1847820" d="4930">what you're doing is evil - it might be wrong.
It might be misguided. But who's to say in</p>
<p t="1852750" d="6350">such a situation as that. It certainly should
be illegal. But at least you can say there's</p>
<p t="1859100" d="5040">a plausible explanation for it, but lots of
situations where there's absolute horror, there's</p>
<p t="1864140" d="5520">no plausible explanation for whatsoever.
I can give you an example. One of the things</p>
<p t="1869660" d="6630">that used to happen in Auschwitz, if i remember
correctly - Auschwitz, I don't know what you guys envision</p>
<p t="1876290" d="5730">when you guys envision concentration camps.
Concentration camp, it's a funny name first</p>
<p t="1882020" d="4780">of all because it's not really a camp. You
know what i mean, but a concentration camp</p>
<p t="1886800" d="6550">isn't like a prison. Thats easy to envision
them like a prison. Those bloody things were</p>
<p t="1893350" d="5170">cities. They had tens of thousands of people
in them. They were massive. At least, they</p>
<p t="1898520" d="3240">were large towns. So these were very big places.</p>
<p t="1901760" d="4880">Anyways, at the typical concentration camp,
the trains would come rolling in and of course</p>
<p t="1906640" d="4120">people had been packed into the damn trains,
well, worse than animals. They'd be packed</p>
<p t="1910760" d="5510">standing, and lots of people just died in
the cars, especially if they were old or little</p>
<p t="1916270" d="3290">or had some respiratory problems or something
like that because they would overheat if they</p>
<p t="1919560" d="3540">were cramped in the middle of people or they
would freeze to death along the outside because</p>
<p t="1923100" d="4170">they would freeze against the wood. But that
was okay, it just made the job easier when</p>
<p t="1927270" d="6200">they finally landed at Auschwitz. And then,
once they were in Auschwitz, the guards would</p>
<p t="1933470" d="3940">play tricks on them. One trick would be to
get some poor son of a bitch, who'd you know,</p>
<p t="1937410" d="4660">been torn away from his country, who had his
family destroyed, who knew where he was going,</p>
<p t="1942070" d="5170">who was half dead for six different reasons.
Maybe he didn't even speak, or she didn't</p>
<p t="1947240" d="7730">even speak that was most common there, guarded
by absolutely ruthless barbarians who wanted</p>
<p t="1954970" d="5590">to do nothing else but make people as miserable
as possible in the most creative possible</p>
<p t="1960560" d="1180">ways.</p>
<p t="1961740" d="3340">And so, what they would do was, some of the
prisoners, they would give them wet sacks</p>
<p t="1965080" d="4770">of salt - and so those weighed about a hundred
pounds - and they'd have them carry from one</p>
<p t="1969850" d="7480">side of the compound to the other. Well, that's
not so bad, when you're really, really innovative</p>
<p t="1977330" d="3530">in your capacity to perpetrate evil, and the
next thing they made them did was carry them</p>
<p t="1980860" d="4630">back. You think about that, you know, and
this is something you have to understand if</p>
<p t="1985490" d="6630">you really want to understand evil is that
it's an aesthetic, it's an art form. The reason</p>
<p t="1992120" d="3880">that was such a terrible torture was, well
partly because these people were already ruined,</p>
<p t="1996000" d="3920">and a hundred pounds is a lot of salt, and
maybe it was winter and they didn't have any</p>
<p t="1999920" d="3040">shoes, and - you know, like it was just brutal
labor.</p>
<p t="2002960" d="3550">But Solzhenitsyn, when he wrote about the
Gulag Archipelago, he said, you know even</p>
<p t="2006510" d="3850">if you were a prisoner and they were having
you build a wall, you could at least take</p>
<p t="2010360" d="4070">some damn pride in building the wall. You
could lay some bricks out, and you could say</p>
<p t="2014430" d="4080">well this suck and it's really horrible and
everything but you know, I built a straight</p>
<p t="2018510" d="4840">wall. That's something. But if you have to
take a sack of wet salt from one side of the</p>
<p t="2023350" d="7730">compound and then carry it back, the net consequence
of that is zero. It's zero. And of course,</p>
<p t="2031080" d="6040">the famous sign on the outside of the concentration
camps were Work will set you free.</p>
<p t="2037120" d="8060">Right? Now that's another joke. It's like
mutual assured Destruction, and the only way</p>
<p t="2045180" d="7919">you could - a joke like that is satanic. There's
no other way to think about it. A joke like</p>
<p t="2053099" d="6210">that comes out of the deepest depths of human
malevolence. Then the work that sets you free,</p>
<p t="2059309" d="6510">it wasn't even work. It was a parody of work.
And the purpose of the work was to destroy</p>
<p t="2065819" d="7220">you, but not quickly because that's not as
terrible as destroying you slowly. So these</p>
<p t="2073039" d="6080">are very very terrible things. Part of what
I thought about in relation to people's belief</p>
<p t="2079119" d="5750">systems was people are territorial. Chimps
- I don't know if you know this or not - chimps</p>
<p t="2084869" d="5250">basically go to war.
Jane Goodall discovered that a couple of decades</p>
<p t="2090119" d="4621">ago and it really, really was hard on her
because she was kind of a Rousseauian. For</p>
<p t="2094740" d="5769">those of you who don't know, Jean Jacques
Rousseau was a French philosopher and French</p>
<p t="2100509" d="3580">philosophers have an awful lot of sins on
their conscience and Rousseau was certainly</p>
<p t="2104089" d="6530">one of them because Rousseau was the first
fully articulate promoter of the idea that</p>
<p t="2110619" d="5041">human beings were basically good. So we had
a good soul in a moral sense, but we were</p>
<p t="2115660" d="9599">corrupted by our social institutions. So,
as far as Rousseau is concerned, it was kind</p>
<p t="2125259" d="2090">of a noble savage idea.</p>
<p t="2127349" d="4651">Like the human being in their raw form has
a pure soul and then you give them to parents,</p>
<p t="2132000" d="4359">and you give them to teachers, and they get
into politics, then there's group disputes</p>
<p t="2136359" d="5750">and they get all corrupted. Well that's it.
I don't even know what else to say about that</p>
<p t="2142109" d="4980">except that it's absolutely moronic, but it's
an appealing proposition if you're a naive</p>
<p t="2147089" d="4071">optimist. I mean, first of all, it doesn't
explain where malevolence comes from because</p>
<p t="2151160" d="5099">the people created the institutions, so it
just puts you into an infinite regress. Chicken</p>
<p t="2156259" d="4731">and egg. If the institutions are reprehensible
but the people who built them aren't, then</p>
<p t="2160990" d="3339">where did the reprehensible elements of the
institution come from?</p>
<p t="2164329" d="4180">He might think thats its an auto generating
consequence of organizing people, but you</p>
<p t="2168509" d="6330">know it's a pretty specious theory. Of course
he had a counterpart, a philosophical counterpart,</p>
<p t="2174839" d="5541">Thomas Hobbes and Hobbes said basically exactly
the opposite, that people were vicious and</p>
<p t="2180380" d="5729">cruel, and unless you put them in straitjackets
- fundamentally - and made them obey, everything</p>
<p t="2186109" d="2811">was going to go immediately to hell.</p>
<p t="2188920" d="5179">And when you saw what happened in Iran when
the Americans waltzed in, and then the power</p>
<p t="2194099" d="3960">structure disintegrated, it was a hell of
a lot more like Hobbes than Rousseau. You</p>
<p t="2198059" d="5550">took out the tyrant at the top and it wasn't
like everyone got all peaceful and loving</p>
<p t="2203609" d="5970">all of a sudden. It was like absolute chaos
reigned. Of course, you can rationalize that.</p>
<p t="2209579" d="6641">Anyways, Rousseau had five children by a maid
- an illiteral maid - that was his mistress,</p>
<p t="2216220" d="4589">and he put every single one of them in orphanages,
and of course they perished because orphanages</p>
<p t="2220809" d="6081">at Rousseau's time were not exactly a luxury
resort. Even up until the beginning of the</p>
<p t="2226890" d="7000">20th century, who were under one years of
age, who were in care institutions die, partly</p>
<p t="2233890" d="4869">disease and that sort of thing. But partly
because they weren't touched, cared for physical,</p>
<p t="2238759" d="9161">even if they were fed. And 200 years ago,
they weren't even fed. Anyways, nonetheless,</p>
<p t="2247920" d="6760">people maintained the optimistic idea that
human beings were basically good and were</p>
<p t="2254680" d="6450">corrupted by institution. It's a very common
idea in universities.</p>
<p t="2261130" d="3260">University people are always complaining about
the corrupt nature about this institution,</p>
<p t="2264390" d="7360">and that institution, while they sit here
in the warmth with the electricity on. It's</p>
<p t="2271750" d="4730">surrounded by wealth that characterizes maybe
one tenth of one percent of the entire world's</p>
<p t="2276480" d="4400">population, and they complained about how
oppressed they are and how nasty the institutions</p>
<p t="2280880" d="6340">are. Well, you know you actually haven't been
to a nasty institution because they get pretty</p>
<p t="2287220" d="5770">damn bad. Most of the institutions in the
world are like that. So, it isn't exactly</p>
<p t="2292990" d="4510">clear that people are pristine in their heart
and corrupted by institutions, although I'm</p>
<p t="2297500" d="3569">sure that happened. It happened with Panzram
for example.</p>
<p t="2301069" d="7921">Anyways, this has been a line of philosophical
speculation that's - I would say, constituted</p>
<p t="2308990" d="6140">one of the unspoken fundamental assumptions
of Western intellectuals in particular. Jane</p>
<p t="2315130" d="4310">Goodall thought, in many ways, the same way.
She thought chimps were basically animals,</p>
<p t="2319440" d="13280">they're okay. They co-exist relatively peacefully
with one another. Even Carl Rogers - who I</p>
<p t="2332720" d="4049">talk about a bit in my Personality class - he
thought that people were basically fundamentally</p>
<p t="2336769" d="4951">good and that institutions made them bad.
But the problem is, you look at chimps and</p>
<p t="2341720" d="1359">they're a fair bit like us.</p>
<p t="2343079" d="6730">Bonobos - you can look at them too, they're
genetically quite related to us, so we're</p>
<p t="2349809" d="6220">a weird mixture of the two. But chimps, like
those things, there is no evidence that they</p>
<p t="2356029" d="5851">really have any internal control over their
aggression at all. There was a horrible case</p>
<p t="2361880" d="4639">about two years ago, where a woman was interacting
with a chimp and it tore her to pieces, and</p>
<p t="2366519" d="6050">they can do that. It took her face right off,
and they have about the strength of six men.</p>
<p t="2372569" d="5641">An adult male chimp can break a three hundred
pound test cable. Those things are really,</p>
<p t="2378210" d="3940">really strong, and they're not friendly.</p>
<p t="2382150" d="8590">So in Arnhem zoo for example, there has been
a troop of chimps there that have been followed</p>
<p t="2390740" d="4809">by an extremely brilliant primatologist named
Frans de Waal, whose work I would very highly</p>
<p t="2395549" d="4220">recommend. De Waal is a very smart guy, and
he's looked at the origins of morality in</p>
<p t="2399769" d="4611">chimpanzees, from you know, a biological perspective.
It's very, very nice work - very, very clear-headed.</p>
<p t="2404380" d="6020">But you know, he's recounted absolutely horrific
stories about chimpanzee behavior. One of</p>
<p t="2410400" d="4879">the stories he talked about, for example,
was you kind of have this idea that there's</p>
<p t="2415279" d="3820">a male chimp hierarchy. It's roughly true
- there's a female hierarchy too, but the</p>
<p t="2419099" d="3301">males in the chimp world anyways, tend to
be the dominant ones.</p>
<p t="2422400" d="5840">You know, you kind of think of a dominant
primate as a prize fighter. He's ruling because</p>
<p t="2428240" d="5829">of his physical prowess. Now that turns out
not to exactly be true. In this particular</p>
<p t="2434069" d="3901">case, the guy who was running the chimp troop
was a bit of a bully, and he wasn't making</p>
<p t="2437970" d="5240">any friends. That's not such a good idea because
no matter how tough you are by yourself, two</p>
<p t="2443210" d="4099">weaker guys can probably take you out, and
that's what happened during Frans de Waal's</p>
<p t="2447309" d="250">observations.</p>
<p t="2447559" d="4681">Two chimps attacked the leader. They had a
coalition, they were grooming each other,</p>
<p t="2452240" d="5690">they were pals. And chimps are pretty good
at remembering reciprocal relationships, and</p>
<p t="2457930" d="4089">having friendships. They have a very highly
social structure. They just tore him apart.</p>
<p t="2462019" d="3951">The things they did to him, like you don't
even want to know about. So chimps really</p>
<p t="2465970" d="4619">have no upper limit on their capacity for
aggression. And when they hunt, because chimps</p>
<p t="2470589" d="4720">hunt, they like meat - they often hunt Colobus
monkeys, and they weight about 35 pounds.</p>
<p t="2475309" d="3681">A Colobus monkey is a major league animal,
and they eat those things alive. And they</p>
<p t="2478990" d="4009">scream while they're being killed, and that
does not slow the chimps down one bit. So</p>
<p t="2482999" d="5201">it's not obvious the chimp is really a creature
of a lot of empathy - especially the males.</p>
<p t="2488200" d="3760">The females are likely more empathetic because
they have to deal with infants for long periods</p>
<p t="2491960" d="6690">of time. What seems to inhibit the aggression
of male chimps isn't anything they hold internally.</p>
<p t="2498650" d="3849">It seems that when they get hyper aggressive
in the troop, the troop gets more and more</p>
<p t="2502499" d="4241">agitated and basically shuts them down. So
you can imagine maybe you're in a rough bar,</p>
<p t="2506740" d="4819">and some dingbat who's half-psychopathic and
has had two pints of alcohol, is starting</p>
<p t="2511559" d="4181">to cause a tremendous amount of trouble. He's
not going to shut himself down, but the rest</p>
<p t="2515740" d="5109">of the troop might. And that kind of means
the control over the aggression is externalized.</p>
<p t="2520849" d="6750">It's not a consequence of superego control.
We like to think that we control our own aggression,</p>
<p t="2527599" d="4381">but I'm not so sure about that.
If you read things like - there's a great</p>
<p t="2531980" d="4629">book, a horrifying book published about twenty
years ago called the Rape of Nanking,</p>
<p t="2536609" d="4740">which is - the woman who wrote it committed
suicide and that suffices to tell you what</p>
<p t="2541349" d="4940">the Rape of Nanking was all about. It's a
story about the Japanese in WW2 going into</p>
<p t="2546289" d="5510">a Chinese city called Nanking where, I believe,
about 350,000 people were killed.</p>
<p t="2551799" d="4411">The Nazis in that story were the good guys,
so you can imagine the kind of brutality that</p>
<p t="2556210" d="6289">was going on there. But, there's absolutely,
perfectly well documented evidence that the</p>
<p t="2562499" d="6671">Japanese soldiers engaged in competitive brutality.
So really what happened was the Japanese had</p>
<p t="2569170" d="5040">been pretty militarized by World War II, and
they adopted a Prussian education system.</p>
<p t="2574210" d="7369">The Prussians and Germans, pre 20th century
Germans, were basically interested in educating</p>
<p t="2581579" d="5520">obedient soldiers because it was a militaristic
culture. The Japanese kind of adopted that</p>
<p t="2587099" d="3670">because they were pretty sick of being kicked
around by the Europeans - pretty successfully</p>
<p t="2590769" d="4361">because they defeated the Russians in the
early stages of the 20th century.</p>
<p t="2595130" d="4590">It was quite a shock to everyone in Europe,
and a cause for great celebration in Japan.</p>
<p t="2599720" d="4339">Anyways, they militarized the hell out of
their young men, and taught them basically</p>
<p t="2604059" d="4821">that the Japanese were a master race, and
that other people were subhuman. It's a very</p>
<p t="2608880" d="5560">common human way of thinking, by the way.
I would say it's really the default way human</p>
<p t="2614440" d="5399">tribes think about other tribes. I mean, it's
a little more complicated than that because</p>
<p t="2619839" d="3611">human tribes tend to trade with other tribes.</p>
<p t="2623450" d="4339">So it's not all demonization, but a lot of
it is. If you look around the world in the</p>
<p t="2627789" d="5480">anthropological literature, what you see is
that the names that most tribes have for themselves</p>
<p t="2633269" d="5411">is something like The Human Beings, or The
People, indicating that the rest of the people</p>
<p t="2638680" d="4349">aren't really people. They're barbarians,
or you know. They live out where the sun is</p>
<p t="2643029" d="6631">being eaten by the dragon of the night. The
word barbarian is a word that comes from the</p>
<p t="2649660" d="4990">Greeks making fun of how non-Greeks spoke.
They thought they went bar bar bar bar</p>
<p t="2654650" d="5889">bar, something like that. So anyways, what
Goodall found was that the chimps - the chimp</p>
<p t="2660539" d="5480">adolescents in particular, particularly the
males - would patrol the borders of their</p>
<p t="2666019" d="5980">territory in groups of three or four, often
with a female or two. But the females didn't</p>
<p t="2671999" d="6830">seem to be really the - they were more part
of the group rather than the initiators. But</p>
<p t="2678829" d="3930">what the chimps would do is if they found
a chimp from another troop, even if that was</p>
<p t="2682759" d="5050">a chimp that had moved from their troop in
the not too distant past and joined another,</p>
<p t="2687809" d="3851">cause sometimes the males leave and they go
to other troops. If they outnumbered them,</p>
<p t="2691660" d="2280">they would tear them to pieces.</p>
<p t="2693940" d="4869">It looked like that was why they were doing
the border patrol. They're out looking for</p>
<p t="2698809" d="3121">trouble. They're gangs, roughly speaking,
and they were looking for trouble. But the</p>
<p t="2701930" d="4689">point of it is that - and they would only
attack if they outnumbered because chimps</p>
<p t="2706619" d="500">can, I wouldn't say they can count, but they
have a rudimentary notion of group size.</p>
<p t="2713789" d="4480">i don't think you can count without being able
to verbalize, but you can estimate at a glance.</p>
<p t="2718269" d="7411">So when I say tear apart, that's exactly what
I mean. There's no upper limit on the brutality.</p>
<p t="2725680" d="4560">So Goodall discovered that first, and she
didn't tell anybody about it. Now she had</p>
<p t="2730249" d="5409">a reason. Some of them might think we're ideological
- oh the lovely chimps, and fair enough. But</p>
<p t="2735999" d="4881">some of it was also that she thought that
maybe the chimps had been corrupted as a consequence</p>
<p t="2740880" d="4719">of their contact with human beings and their
natural behavior had been somehow transformed.</p>
<p t="2745599" d="5101">And that's not - it's reasonable to be cautious
as a scientist before you go out and say hey</p>
<p t="2750700" d="6549">chimps go to war. Isn't that revolutionary,
because it is. It just ends the idea that</p>
<p t="2757249" d="3770">our war-like, malevolent nature is just a
function of culture.</p>
<p t="2761019" d="5260">Like if chimps do it, well what are they perverted
by their own culture? I don't think so.</p>
<p t="2766279" d="4820">I mean there are more and less violent chimp
cultures, and there's more and less violent</p>
<p t="2771099" d="5551">baboon cultures. There's some culture variance,
but since Goodall's time, this sort of behavior</p>
<p t="2776650" d="6459">has been documented on many, many chimp troops.
So that's us, in a nutshell. It's not self</p>
<p t="2783109" d="6710">evident if you put the typical adolescent
male, who's not a very well formulated personality,</p>
<p t="2789819" d="4950">and you know - because he's not that individual
and he hasn't seen much of the world. The</p>
<p t="2794769" d="5121">typical guy who goes into the army is kind
of on the margins of society. Maybe he's not</p>
<p t="2799890" d="5600">particularly bright. I'm not trying to be
insulting by that, but it's not exactly a</p>
<p t="2805490" d="1900">high end job.</p>
<p t="2807390" d="5800">You put someone like that in a place where
there's no rules. It's like who leads where</p>
<p t="2813190" d="4300">there are no rules? Well the probability that
it's the friendliest and nicest people is</p>
<p t="2817490" d="4890">very, very low. So what seemed to happen in
Nanking was the Japanese soldiers took their</p>
<p t="2822380" d="4929">cues from the people with the most brutal
imaginations</p>
<p t="2827309" d="6050">People can have pretty brutal imaginations,
especially when they start to compete. So,</p>
<p t="2833359" d="6601">I was interested in that. What exactly was
at the core of that malevolence. I think it's</p>
<p t="2839960" d="3950">uniquely human. The chimps would go and tear
apart, but basically they're just going to</p>
<p t="2843910" d="3980">kill them. That's their goal, and maybe it
might take awhile, but it's not going to take</p>
<p t="2847890" d="5060">four weeks whereas if you're a human being,
you can draw out your enemy's death for a</p>
<p t="2852950" d="5950">very, very long. Part of that is the desire to produce
the misery and suffering that's attended on</p>
<p t="2858900" d="6740">the death. Only human beings have the imagination
to do that. That's why I think in the book</p>
<p t="2865640" d="6250">of Genesis where people's eyes are open and
they become self conscious, they also learn</p>
<p t="2871890" d="4189">the difference between good and evil. Once
your eyes are open and you know what you're</p>
<p t="2876079" d="4670">like, once you know you're naked and vulnerable,
you can exploit that in other people.</p>
<p t="2880749" d="4610">Only human beings have that kind of knowledge.
So the fact that we know we can be hurt makes</p>
<p t="2885359" d="5081">us particularly dangerous because if I know
how I can be hurt, I sure know how you can</p>
<p t="2890440" d="7309">be hurt. So it's a nasty situation. I'm kind
of interested in the motivation for that.</p>
<p t="2897749" d="5431">You look at the Columbine kids, for example,
and the mayhem they produced was trivial to</p>
<p t="2903180" d="4149">the mayhem they were planning. If it was up
to those two guys, they would have bombed</p>
<p t="2907329" d="5811">Detroit flat. They had visions of exactly
that. And it was a media spectacular, and</p>
<p t="2913140" d="6510">they didnt do it because they were poor kids
in some sense who were bullied. That is an</p>
<p t="2919650" d="5359">idiotic explanation. It's not true. Everybody
is a bloody outsider. I'm sure there isn't</p>
<p t="2925009" d="4080">a single one of you who doesn't have a memory
from junior high where you were an outcast</p>
<p t="2929089" d="3770">in one way or another. Maybe some of you weren't,
but it's very, very common.</p>
<p t="2932859" d="5051">To think of that as sufficient motivation
to shoot people cold bloodedly in a high school</p>
<p t="2937910" d="5329">- sorry, that's a little on the naive side.
So I'm very, very interested in what makes</p>
<p t="2943239" d="7141">up that motivation because malevolence plus
nuclear weapons isn't a very good combination.</p>
<p t="2950380" d="4939">It doesn't look to me that we can afford that
unconscious malevolence anymore because we're</p>
<p t="2955319" d="4401">just too powerful, and if the wrong person
ends up being like that with the wrong weapons,</p>
<p t="2959720" d="7440">it's like game over. I've also become convinced
while I'd been looking through this that the</p>
<p t="2967160" d="5250">problem that we're discussing is not a sociological
problem, or a political problem, or an economic</p>
<p t="2972410" d="3530">problem because a lot of what you read - and
a lot of political scientists will tell you</p>
<p t="2975940" d="3379">this sort of thing because they're basically
closet Marxists - is that they'll tell you</p>
<p t="2979319" d="5811">the reason for struggle between nations is
economic.</p>
<p t="2985130" d="5260">I think that's absurd, not because it isn't
true, but because it doesn't actually address</p>
<p t="2990390" d="5290">a more fundamental issue which is okay, economic
struggle is a struggle about who has access</p>
<p t="2995680" d="7399">to what's valued. But, there's nothing self
evident about what's value. That's the problem.</p>
<p t="3003079" d="8883">It's like you have the idea of natural resource.
Oil is not a natural resource until you have an automobile.</p>
<p t="3012249" d="5790">The interplay between cultural value structures
and what constitutes a natural resource is</p>
<p t="3018039" d="6141">so tightly put together - except for maybe
air and water - that saying there are natural</p>
<p t="3024180" d="4679">resources which means things of intrinsic
value, and that's what people fight over.</p>
<p t="3028859" d="6341">Well, you've made the mystery disappear inside
the word natural resource. You haven't solved</p>
<p t="3035200" d="6109">anything. Well the question is why would people
fight over things that they value? Well because</p>
<p t="3041309" d="7141">there's all sorts of things you can value,
like peace. So, it's not a sufficient explanation</p>
<p t="3048450" d="5839">and it's also not clear to me people's primary
motivations are economic.</p>
<p t="3054289" d="5080">Well it's not trivial, but I would say the
motivation isn't really economic. It's more</p>
<p t="3059369" d="5140">related to dominance hierarchy position, and
that's fundamentally a sexual motivation especially</p>
<p t="3064509" d="4490">for men because if men are higher up the
dominance hierarchy, women are more attracted</p>
<p t="3068999" d="7290">to them. So you could say that's economic.
I don't think it is. Economic is just a secondary</p>
<p t="3076289" d="4750">consequence of that. I don't believe, by the
way, that's a theory because there's excellent</p>
<p t="3081039" d="5330">documentation on hyper aggression in adolescent
males, and the best evidence suggests that</p>
<p t="3086369" d="4190">adolescent males become hyper aggressive when
you put them in situations where they can't</p>
<p t="3090559" d="3871">win. Then they become hyper aggressive and
attempt to formulate a dominance hierarchy</p>
<p t="3094430" d="3990">so that some of them can rise to the top and
basically be attractive.</p>
<p t="3098420" d="5069">So you can call that economic if you want,
but I think you're pushing your luck with</p>
<p t="3103489" d="13421">that sort of explanation. Well, so that's
basically the background. So, when I was investigating</p>
<p t="3116910" d="4230">this, I first started studying political science
and I actually liked that quite a bit in the</p>
<p t="3121140" d="3859">first couple years because I was basically
reading political philosophy. It's actually</p>
<p t="3124999" d="6240">worthwhile reading great political philosophers
because A - they could think - and B - you</p>
<p t="3131239" d="4850">think like they think even if you don't know
it because one of the hallmarks of a great</p>
<p t="3136089" d="7450">philosopher is that his ideas or her ideas
sink into the culture so deeply that a hundred</p>
<p t="3143539" d="4250">years after they were written, they think
they've always thought that way.</p>
<p t="3147789" d="3421">That's one of the things that's happened to
Freud. One of the things people understand</p>
<p t="3151210" d="7889">is that theres an unconscious and that's its
motivated by sexual drive. It's like what's</p>
<p t="3159099" d="16901">so brilliant about that? Yeah, well it's obvious
once Freud points it out. So anyways, I started</p>
<p t="3176000" d="5440">- I took political science and literature
which I also found was extremely useful because</p>
<p t="3181440" d="8200">great literary people have great things to
say. Like Dostoevsky's novels absolutely flatten</p>
<p t="3189640" d="5719">me. He's so brilliant and I've never read
anyone who takes moral question so seriously.</p>
<p t="3195359" d="5081">For example, if you look at Crime and Punishment,
which is a book I would highly recommend,</p>
<p t="3200440" d="6720">Dostoevsky is an absolute model of a true
intellectual. I say that because in Crime</p>
<p t="3207160" d="6369">and Punishment, for example, Dostoevsky had
this character named Raskolnikov, and you</p>
<p t="3213529" d="4701">guys can identify with Raskolnikov because
he's a university student and he's your age.</p>
<p t="3218230" d="3369">Now he's having a rough time because he's
in St. Petersburg and he doesn't have any</p>
<p t="3221599" d="4861">money and he lives in this tiny little room
which basically has a bunch of clothes on</p>
<p t="3226460" d="2460">the bed which he sleeps in, and he's basically
starving to death.</p>
<p t="3228920" d="4750">He only has bread to eat, and he's a law student.
So he's having a rough time. St. Petersburg</p>
<p t="3233670" d="5139">at the end of the 19th century is kind of
a rough place. Some of you guys probably have</p>
<p t="3238809" d="4460">it pretty bad, but Raskolnikov kind of had
it pretty bad. And so, he's half starved and</p>
<p t="3243269" d="6901">half delirious. Also, his ideas are very addled
because he's one of the first Russians who</p>
<p t="3250170" d="8179">really considered himself an Atheist. Russia
was a medieval society until the late 1900's.</p>
<p t="3258349" d="2851">It was sort of like Quebec before 1960.</p>
<p t="3261200" d="1559">[Students' laughter]</p>
<p t="3262759" d="4381">I'm serious about that, because Quebec was
basically the last European country, so to</p>
<p t="3267140" d="5399">speak, that underwent a secularization, and
that happened in about 1960. Quebec families</p>
<p t="3272539" d="5200">went from an average size of about 12 to 13
to about 1.2. Lowest birth rate in the world.</p>
<p t="3277739" d="3570">And all the Quebecois were married, and none
of them are now, and they were all Catholic,</p>
<p t="3281309" d="4930">hardly any of them are now. It was an overnight
transformation. That's partly what fed Quebec</p>
<p t="3286239" d="6651">nationalism. There was actually a study that
was released by the Gallup organization. I've</p>
<p t="3292890" d="5540">only heard it referred to in one meeting where
they indicated if you were a lapsed Catholic</p>
<p t="3298430" d="5540">in Quebec, you were ten times more likely
to be a separatist. That's really worth thinking</p>
<p t="3303970" d="5039">about right, because religion just collapses
and nationalism just rises up to take its</p>
<p t="3309009" d="4100">place because you need a bloody belief structure
because, what are you gonna do? Wander around</p>
<p t="3313109" d="1271">aimlessly?</p>
<p t="3314380" d="7830">That's not fun. It's not useful. So, you just
jump from one structure of belief to another,</p>
<p t="3322210" d="6440">or you fall apart. So that's also something
very much worth knowing. Anyways, Raskolnikov,</p>
<p t="3328650" d="4129">he thinks he's a pretty educated guy and thinks
he's pretty smart, and he is pretty smart</p>
<p t="3332779" d="4151">but he's like smart arrogant, not smart wise
because he's 21. What the hell does he know?</p>
<p t="3336930" d="4879">He doesn't know anything, but he's smart.
He's contemptuous about other people because</p>
<p t="3341809" d="4641">he's probably smarter than most of them and
he confuses that with knowing what's going</p>
<p t="3346450" d="6450">on. He lives in this little horrible apartment,
and he has a really horrible landlady - this</p>
<p t="3352900" d="5959">is where Dostoevsky is a genius - like Raskolnikov
hates his landlady, and Dostoevsky tells you</p>
<p t="3358859" d="9051">why. Then you think well yeah, I'd hate her
too. So, she's miserable. She owns a bunch</p>
<p t="3367910" d="2869">of apartments. She charges too much rent for
them.</p>
<p t="3370779" d="4810">She tortures all the people that rent from
her in every possible way she can. The places</p>
<p t="3375589" d="4910">are filthy. She doesn't provide any furniture.
She hoards money, and doesn't do anything</p>
<p t="3380499" d="6510">with it, so she lives in absolute poverty
and filth. She's a cruel person in every possible</p>
<p t="3387009" d="6371">way. Plus she has a niece who isn't very bright,
and she basically treats her like a slave.</p>
<p t="3393380" d="4689">So, she's not doing anyone any good. That's
Raskolnikov's idea. And then, he gets a letter</p>
<p t="3398069" d="5670">from his mother and his mother basically tells
him that his sister's going to go marry this</p>
<p t="3403739" d="6221">rich guy because she's in love with him, and
that'll solve all of his monetary problems</p>
<p t="3409960" d="1430">so he could keep going to law school.</p>
<p t="3411390" d="5179">But he reads between the lines and he realizes
pretty quickly that this rich guy is a real</p>
<p t="3416569" d="4920">miserly scum rat, and he's gonna treat his
sister and his mother absolutely miserably,</p>
<p t="3421489" d="3141">and his sister doesn't really love him anyways,
and the only reason she was marrying him is</p>
<p t="3424630" d="6209">so Raskolnikov can go to school. So he's not
very happy with that, and fair enough. You</p>
<p t="3430839" d="4420">can understand his motivation. So he's starving
and he's full of these ideas and they're also</p>
<p t="3435259" d="8310">sort of Nietzschean. Like Atheistic ideas
hit Russia really hard because it went from</p>
<p t="3443569" d="5970">seriously orthodox Christian in every possible
way to unbelievably skeptical in one generation.</p>
<p t="3449539" d="1861">It just fractured the society.</p>
<p t="3451400" d="4599">It's partly why Communism became so absolutely
attractive for the Russians, and Dostoevsky</p>
<p t="3455999" d="4881">also details that extremely brilliantly in
the book called The Possessed or The Devil's.</p>
<p t="3460880" d="4300">It's a wonderful book. It's hard to get into,
you have to read about 200 pages before it</p>
<p t="3465180" d="7149">really kicks in, but Russian novels are sort
of like that. So anyways, Raskolnikov is thinking</p>
<p t="3472329" d="5200">these sort of super man-ish, rationalistic
ideas, and he thinks, well you know there's</p>
<p t="3477529" d="6320">no evidence that there's any real moral hierarchy.
And you can easily make a case that the reason</p>
<p t="3483849" d="4831">that people aren't really moral, they're just
cowardly - and this is a Nietzschean observation.</p>
<p t="3488680" d="3299">Most of what you'd call your morality isn't
morality at all. It's just you're too afraid</p>
<p t="3491979" d="4510">to do what you want, and because you're too
weasly to admit that, you say you don't do</p>
<p t="3496489" d="2891">those things because it isn't moral. But it
isn't true.</p>
<p t="3499380" d="5099">You'd love to do them if you were brave enough,
but you aren't. So people misread that to</p>
<p t="3504479" d="4461">say what Nietzsche thought that all morality
was cowardice. That isn't what he thought.</p>
<p t="3508940" d="6119">He thought all cowardice masqueraded as morality.
That's a whole different thing. So anyways,</p>
<p t="3515059" d="5500">Raskolnikov is thinking about these things.
He's thinking, well I can be lawyer. I can</p>
<p t="3520559" d="4331">be a good one. I'd help people. I'd help the
poor people. What the hell good is it for</p>
<p t="3524890" d="4679">me to wander around starving like this. It
doesn't seem reasonable. My sister's basically</p>
<p t="3529569" d="5641">going to go prostitute herself for this rich
guy, and that sucks. There's my landlady and</p>
<p t="3535210" d="5450">she's an absolutely reprehensible creature
and everyone agrees, and she's old and worn</p>
<p t="3540660" d="7790">out. And she has this person she keeps as
a slave. Maybe I should just get rid of her.</p>
<p t="3548450" d="8799">What I love about that is that - like this
happens almost all the time in universities,</p>
<p t="3557249" d="4401">I would say. Whenever you hear people who
think they're smart having a discussion. What</p>
<p t="3561650" d="4879">they generally do is that they have an idea,
and then they have an idea about the person</p>
<p t="3566529" d="5090">who has a different idea. The idea about the
person who has the different idea is that</p>
<p t="3571619" d="6380">their idea is stupid. So what they do is produce
a caricature of that person's idea, and then</p>
<p t="3577999" d="5580">they blast it. Then they think, wow I've won
that argument. Which is really - it's pathetic.</p>
<p t="3583579" d="4470">It's a strawman argument. It's a sign of a
weak mind. What you do if you really want</p>
<p t="3588049" d="4601">to have an argument with someone is you help
them. Let's say you're a right winger and</p>
<p t="3592650" d="2839">you're arguing with a left winger, or you're
left winger and you're arguing with a right</p>
<p t="3595489" d="6750">winger. It's like, you want to make their
argument as magnificent as you possibly can,</p>
<p t="3602239" d="3490">and then see if you can undermine it.</p>
<p t="3605729" d="5691">That's what you do because then you're getting
somewhere. Like any idiot can make a strawman</p>
<p t="3611420" d="6740">and light it. Dostoevsky never does that.
He makes the people - like when he sets up</p>
<p t="3618160" d="6569">two ideas to go to war, he embodies both sets
of ideas in the most powerful characters he</p>
<p t="3624729" d="6201">can imagine. So in The Brothers Karamazov,
for example, the two people, the two protagonists</p>
<p t="3630930" d="3270">basically - there's a bunch of them - but
basically one of them is named Ilyusha, and</p>
<p t="3634200" d="4940">the other is named Ivan. And Ilyusha is kind
of an innocent guy. A good guy fundamentally,</p>
<p t="3639140" d="5810">a little on the naive side. Religious, but
not in the way that he can defend. It's more</p>
<p t="3644950" d="4460">like a natural expression spirit, and he's
in a monastery, and he's a follower of this</p>
<p t="3649410" d="10530">famous monk. He's kind of into Orthodox Christianity
in his benevolent and sincere way. But he's</p>
<p t="3659940" d="2030">not much of an intellect.</p>
<p t="3661970" d="3879">And Ivan, his older brother, he's good looking
and tall. I believe he's a soldier. He's an</p>
<p t="3665849" d="6581">impressive guy, and he's got a viciously cutting
intellect. He just tears Ilyusha apart every</p>
<p t="3672430" d="4740">chance he gets, across the whole book. You
can see two parts of Dostoevsky fighting it</p>
<p t="3677170" d="5439">out in the book because part of Dostoevsky
was highly spiritualized, not least because</p>
<p t="3682609" d="6111">he was epileptic and that often - for reasons
we'll talk about later - that often exaggerates</p>
<p t="3688720" d="6389">spirituality. Also because he was a deeply
spiritual person and also a tremendous intellect.</p>
<p t="3695109" d="5390">And so, he was at war inside and he put those
parts of him out into these characters, and</p>
<p t="3700499" d="5780">let them just go at it. It's brilliant, you
know. Ivan makes the best argument for Atheism</p>
<p t="3706279" d="6710">that's ever been written. It's really powerful.
He talks about all these terrible things that</p>
<p t="3712989" d="4770">were being done to children in Russia at the
turn of the century, back in the late 1800's.</p>
<p t="3717759" d="6201">He talks about this one situation where the
parents of this one girl locked her in a freezing</p>
<p t="3723960" d="4950">outhouse overnight. She was crying and screaming,
and telling them that she was sorry. And they</p>
<p t="3728910" d="4699">just left her in there and she froze to death.
It was like front page news in Russia at the</p>
<p t="3733609" d="6010">time, maybe in Moscow, or maybe in St. Petersburg.
Dostoevsky lifted that argument and he said</p>
<p t="3739619" d="7781">to - he had Ivan ask Ilyusha, well this is
the sort of thing God permits? He said the</p>
<p t="3747400" d="4079">whole damn world isn't worth that. The suffering
of one child in a situation like that.</p>
<p t="3751479" d="4360">How can you possibly see that something like
that can exist and wander around with your</p>
<p t="3755839" d="6061">boneheaded belief and a benevolent god? Would
you lock a girl in an outhouse and let her</p>
<p t="3761900" d="4819">freeze? If that meant other people would be
happy? And of course Ilyusha says, no I would</p>
<p t="3766719" d="5840">never do that. So Ivan tells him that, yeah
you wouldn't do that but this god you imagine</p>
<p t="3772559" d="5500">exists would be perfectly pleased to let something
like that occur. And you know Ilyusha has</p>
<p t="3778059" d="4920">no idea what to say about that. That's just
a fragment of Ivan's argument. He's like punching</p>
<p t="3782979" d="6560">at him like mad. I think the way Ilyusha basically
responds is by trying to live a good life.</p>
<p t="3789539" d="9161">He can't argue. Ivan's better at it than he
is, plus there's this vicious strain of critical</p>
<p t="3798700" d="3980">thinking about religion that's being wafted
in from Western Europe.</p>
<p t="3802680" d="5260">There's 300 years of philosophical force behind
it, and Ivan is its mouthpiece. It's like</p>
<p t="3807940" d="6020">Ilyusha and Russia itself is just blown apart
by that. They have no defense against that.</p>
<p t="3813960" d="4750">The bloody Western Europeans had 300 years
to get used to it. The Russians had like ten</p>
<p t="3818710" d="6369">years. It just fragmented them. They were
like waiting for the new Messiah, and they</p>
<p t="3825079" d="7601">sure got one. Both Dostoevsky and Nietzsche
prophesied about what happened to Russia forty</p>
<p t="3832680" d="6429">years before it happened. That's bloody amazing.
To think you could look that far into the</p>
<p t="3839109" d="3650">future and actually get it right. I mean,
things didn't change quite as fast there as</p>
<p t="3842759" d="5411">they are now, but you know, it wasn't like
the Victoria times were static. There were</p>
<p t="3848170" d="4740">a lot of things going on. To get that right
over four decades - those guys were in touch</p>
<p t="3852910" d="8760">with something very deep that was going on
underneath the substrata of Western civilization.</p>
<p t="3861670" d="7869">Alright, so I'm thinking about belief structures
and I'm thinking about malevolence and I'm</p>
<p t="3869539" d="7940">think about the psychological role that these
sorts of things are playing because it occurred</p>
<p t="3877479" d="5661">to me at some point, something like - an idea
something like this. This actually tormented</p>
<p t="3883140" d="4010">me for about six months. I would say, when
I had been thinking these things through - I</p>
<p t="3887150" d="3959">would say about five years at this point - I
was really obsessed by it. I was thinking</p>
<p t="3891109" d="5000">about this literally every minute of the day,
from the time I woke up till the time I went</p>
<p t="3896109" d="8470">to sleep. It was really manic, probably. At
one point I got to this conclusion. I thought,</p>
<p t="3904579" d="5260">okay well here's the situation. It's pretty
obvious that people need belief structures</p>
<p t="3909839" d="5190">because first of all a belief structure orients
them to action so you have to believe that</p>
<p t="3915029" d="2770">one thing is more valuable than other to just
act.</p>
<p t="3917799" d="4661">So, why did the chicken cross the road? Well
because he thought the other side of the road</p>
<p t="3922460" d="2029">was better than the side he was on, obviously.</p>
<p t="3924489" d="651">[Students' laughter]</p>
<p t="3925140" d="5790">You know, because whenever you're moving,
the implicit hypothesis of your movement is</p>
<p t="3930930" d="4020">that the thing you're moving towards is better
than the thing you're leaving, unless you're</p>
<p t="3934950" d="4419">self destructive because otherwise, why bother?
So what that means is that you don't move</p>
<p t="3939369" d="3990">without a value structure, and you don't get
to not have one. You might say, well I don't</p>
<p t="3943359" d="7260">believe in anything. It's like, well, you
say you don't believe in anything, so technically</p>
<p t="3950619" d="5460">you can't make an argument for what you believe
or you don't know what you believe. But if</p>
<p t="3956079" d="6220">you're not just sitting there, vegetating,
then you believe something otherwise - you</p>
<p t="3962299" d="1831">act it out.</p>
<p t="3964130" d="12149">You have to have a belief system or you fall
apart. So you're nihilistic or depressed or</p>
<p t="3976279" d="5740">hopeless. That's certainly - like who wants
that? That's not good. It's painful. Depression</p>
<p t="3982019" d="8750">is no joke. I know someone who had a very
serious illness. It was an illness that destroyed</p>
<p t="3990769" d="4770">part of this person's body. It destroyed their
joints, and they also had clinical depression.</p>
<p t="3995539" d="5401">I asked this person at one point - okay, you
get to have a choice. You get to get rid of</p>
<p t="4000940" d="3329">the illness that's destroying your joints,
so they had to be replaced, or you could get</p>
<p t="4004269" d="5131">rid of the depression. He said, I'd get rid
of the depression first, no problem. So that's</p>
<p t="4009400" d="4040">worth thinking about. If you believe nothing,
and you're hopeless and you've got no value</p>
<p t="4013440" d="5109">structure, the place you end up is not good.
And I'm sure lots of you have experienced</p>
<p t="4018549" d="4101">that. I mean most people - especially the
people who are more likely to come to this</p>
<p t="4022650" d="5719">class - most people, by the time they're your
age, have gone through a dark period or two</p>
<p t="4028369" d="3660">for whatever reason. Relationship breaks up
or maybe you lose the meaning in your life</p>
<p t="4032029" d="4030">or someone betrays you or someone gets sick
or you get sick or, you know, some tragedy</p>
<p t="4036059" d="4180">comes along and knocks you flat. You think,
what the hell, what's going on? Why isn't</p>
<p t="4040239" d="5230">any of this worthwhile? And it's a good questions,
but you can't go there because that's like</p>
<p t="4045469" d="380">death.</p>
<p t="4045849" d="5101">Then the other problem is, let's say you do
have a belief system. Alright, so what happens</p>
<p t="4050950" d="5359">if I have a different one? What are we supposed
to do about that? You can't give up yours</p>
<p t="4056309" d="4660">cause then you're done. I'm not gonna give
up mine for the same reason. But it isn't</p>
<p t="4060969" d="4260">clear that we can inhabit the same part of
the Earth peacefully if we don't believe the</p>
<p t="4065229" d="5830">same things. So I - when I sorted that all
out, I thought well that's it man. We're basically</p>
<p t="4071059" d="3851">- that's it. We're done. We can't not have
a belief system, and if you have one, you</p>
<p t="4074910" d="5349">can't not fight. We're too well armed to fight
now. We're not just going to collapse into</p>
<p t="4080259" d="6990">nihilism, although that happens quite a bit.
So, game's over. Well, it turned out that</p>
<p t="4087249" d="3661">that was wrong, thank god, but it took me
an awful long time to even begin to understand</p>
<p t="4090910" d="5820">how that could possibly be wrong because as
far as I could tell, those were the options.</p>
<p t="4096730" d="5600">So another thing we're gonna try to figure
out is not only exactly why people have belief</p>
<p t="4102330" d="5360">systems, exactly what a belief system is,
and why they compete, and why you can't just</p>
<p t="4107690" d="3970">get rid of them. But, we're also gonna figure
out what it is that you might be able to do</p>
<p t="4111660" d="3860">about the fact that you're going to inhabit
places with people who don't have exactly</p>
<p t="4115520" d="6500">the same belief systems as you. And in some
sense, it's really a problem of social being,</p>
<p t="4122020" d="4580">right? And creatures have been trying to solve
this problem ever since, well we don't know</p>
<p t="4126600" d="5060">how long. I like to use lobsters as an example
because lobsters arrange themselves into dominance</p>
<p t="4131660" d="5270">hierarchies, and they have very complex social
behavior. They don't have much of a brain.</p>
<p t="4136930" d="5210">So you can have pretty damn complex social
behavior without having much of a brain. Lobsters</p>
<p t="4142140" d="3850">have been around for around 400 million years.</p>
<p t="4145990" d="5180">So us, roughly speaking, since we had a shared
ancestor with the lobster a very long time</p>
<p t="4151170" d="4770">ago, we've been trying to figure out how to
coexist with other creatures that don't precisely</p>
<p t="4155940" d="5640">share our belief systems for 400 million years.
And we've been sufficiently successful about</p>
<p t="4161580" d="5440">it so that we're both social, and here we
are. So obviously, there's ways that it can</p>
<p t="4167020" d="6020">be dealt with; although I think we don't necessarily
understand them very well. I didn't want to</p>
<p t="4173040" d="5310">just understand what it was about belief systems,
you know, about their necessity and their</p>
<p t="4178350" d="5040">function, and the way the become pathologist.
I wanted to figure out if there's also a pattern</p>
<p t="4183390" d="7320">to the processes by which belief systems are
modified and negotiated so that belief systems</p>
<p t="4190710" d="4550">that have different structures can coexist
in the same place peacefully.</p>
<p t="4195260" d="4030">It's a vital question right? Because most
of you are going to get married, successfully</p>
<p t="4199290" d="3920">or unsuccessfully. And even if you don't,
you're going to live with someone for a long</p>
<p t="4203210" d="3250">period of time, and you're going to find out
they're not like you, and that's extremely</p>
<p t="4206460" d="7570">annoying. But, what are you gonna do? You're
either going to be a slave, or a tyrant, or</p>
<p t="4214030" d="4880">you're going to negotiate because those are
your options. And negotiation is extraordinarily</p>
<p t="4218910" d="3790">difficult because you have to figure out what
you want, and you probably won't even admit</p>
<p t="4222700" d="4440">it, and second of all you have to listen to
your stupid partner about what they want.</p>
<p t="4227140" d="5640">Then you have to try to figure out how to
make both of them possible. Well, slavery,</p>
<p t="4232780" d="4440">tyranny; that's comparatively easy from a
cognitive perspective, compared to actually</p>
<p t="4237220" d="5740">trying to figure how you can be mutually satisfied
in the same space, but you can do it.</p>
<p t="4242960" d="6330">That's the thing. There is a process, and
it's identifiable. So I want to talk to you</p>
<p t="4249290" d="5370">about belief systems and their psychological
significance. What they're like. What function</p>
<p t="4254660" d="5060">they can perform, but I also want to talk
to you about how they transform because they</p>
<p t="4259720" d="5110">do right? They change, especially with humans.
So they can change - that means they can modify.</p>
<p t="4264830" d="5900">And that means, at least in principle, that
we could have a dialogue. Now dialogues, that's</p>
<p t="4270730" d="5290">rough, but the alternative is war. That's
partly why you're supposed to listen to your</p>
<p t="4276020" d="5100">enemy because if you don't listen to your
enemy, the only other thing you can do is</p>
<p t="4281120" d="2290">fight with them. That's it.</p>
<p t="4283410" d="8280">>>[Student asks: You talked about how belief
systems can often modify, so they can be close</p>
<p t="4291690" d="4130">together. Isn't that what political perspectives
basically is?]</p>
<p t="4295820" d="5550">>> You mean it's the desire for that to happen.
Well, I would say it's partly the desire for</p>
<p t="4301370" d="5570">that to happen. Thing is, whenever I look
at a political movement, especially an ideological</p>
<p t="4306940" d="7970">group, I think okay, there's a bunch of things
you're for. Fine. What are you against? Because</p>
<p t="4314910" d="3550">one of the things about people that have adopted
ideological positions like to presume is that</p>
<p t="4318460" d="6120">all of the right is on their side. That makes
them very unconscious of their shadow, from</p>
<p t="4324580" d="5290">the Jungian perspective. The Nazis had all
sorts of positive reasons for what they're</p>
<p t="4329870" d="4670">doing, but the negative reasons were there
too, and you could easily make it a case that</p>
<p t="4334540" d="2370">the negative reasons were really the reasons.</p>
<p t="4336910" d="5360">When I look at ideologues, I always think,
yeah yeah that's what you're for, but I don't</p>
<p t="4342270" d="4020">really think all the good people are on your
side. And B - I know that negative motivations</p>
<p t="4346290" d="4760">are more powerful than positive ones. So you
say you're for things, but you're against</p>
<p t="4351050" d="6600">them too, so let's start with that. I started
thinking about this after I'd read George</p>
<p t="4357650" d="5690">Orwell. I love George Orwell, by the way.
How many of you know who George Orwell is?</p>
<p t="4363340" d="8100">Wow, really? That's impressive. How many don't?
Okay, well that's good. That's amazing. How</p>
<p t="4371440" d="4070">the hell did you learn about George Orwell?
Is it 1984? Animal Farm?</p>
<p t="4375510" d="1750">>>[Students answer: Animal Farm.]</p>
<p t="4377260" d="4470">>>Okay, okay, well that's good because George
Orwell - I tell you - George Orwell was the</p>
<p t="4381730" d="5130">first Western intellectual who figured out
what the hell was going on in the Soviet Union.</p>
<p t="4386860" d="6390">And he did that in the mid forties, early.
It was complicated because we sort of knew</p>
<p t="4393250" d="3400">what was happening in the twenties and the
thirties. There was Lenin, and that wasn't</p>
<p t="4396650" d="5020">so good. There was the Russian civil war.
There was the idea of universal Communism,</p>
<p t="4401670" d="3680">that wasn't such a good idea, for as far as
people who didn't want to become Communists</p>
<p t="4405350" d="5220">were concerned. And then there was what happened
in the Ukraine in the 1930's. The evidence</p>
<p t="4410570" d="6070">was starting to pile up, but unfortunately
what happened was the Spanish Civil War, and</p>
<p t="4416640" d="4440">the lefties were pretty much the good guys
in the Spanish Civil War. It was like a microcosm</p>
<p t="4421080" d="5510">of the second world war. The lefties were
fighting the fascists, and some of the lefties</p>
<p t="4426590" d="5390">were Communists, but some of them, I think,
were people genuinely fighting for freedom.</p>
<p t="4431980" d="7050">A lot of North American literary figures went
to Spain to fight on the side of the - against</p>
<p t="4439030" d="9240">the fascists. And so fair enough, the fascists
were obviously reprehensible, clearly. So</p>
<p t="4448270" d="4060">that kind of muddied the water, right, because
the fascists were bad and that sort of means</p>
<p t="4452330" d="4210">the people that are fighting them are good,
and some of them are Communists. There was</p>
<p t="4456540" d="5390">pretty good reason for people to be radically
socialist at that point in human history because</p>
<p t="4461930" d="5250">the plight of the working man was relatively
unpleasant. George Orwell wrote a book called</p>
<p t="4467180" d="6080">The Road to Wigan Pier, and he went
up to this town, that was a coal mining town</p>
<p t="4473260" d="8670">and just looked at their life. So here's part
of their life. So, you basically work a seven</p>
<p t="4481930" d="4050">and a half hour shift when you're a coal miner,
and you think oh that's not too bad by 1930</p>
<p t="4485980" d="8110">standards, and it's like yeah except you have
to go down to the coal mine tunnels and they're</p>
<p t="4494090" d="6260">not eight feet high and carpeted. They're
like four and a half feet high and rough,</p>
<p t="4500350" d="6580">and poorly lit, and the air is terrible. So
basically, you have to chimp walk or crawl,</p>
<p t="4506930" d="6510">up to three miles, just to get to work. And
then you'd have to do that at end of your</p>
<p t="4513440" d="5080">shift, and you don't get paid for that. That's
just your commute.</p>
<p t="4518520" d="6080">Then of course what you're doing when you
get there is it's absolutely filthy. It's</p>
<p t="4524600" d="7680">unbelievably noisy and brutally difficult.
Coal miners, they had no teeth, but their</p>
<p t="4532280" d="4710">bodies were absolutely perfect. They were
unbelievably powerful and strong because all</p>
<p t="4536990" d="5690">they did was incredibly intense physical labor.
It was bloody rough. And the housing most</p>
<p t="4542680" d="6820">people had, it's like fifty families for one
outhouse. That's probably good enough to describe</p>
<p t="4549500" d="6250">it. Often they were row houses, and the row
houses had no back doors. They had no paths</p>
<p t="4555750" d="4270">between them, and all the outhouses were at
the back. So, that meant if it was twenty</p>
<p t="4560020" d="2940">below and it was the winter, and you were
sick then you'd get to go all the way around</p>
<p t="4562960" d="3470">your block to get to the damn outhouse and
maybe there was only one there, and you'd</p>
<p t="4566430" d="7570">line up with fifty people so that - you know.
Orwell, he was an upper class guy basically,</p>
<p t="4574000" d="6670">and he was trying to help himself overcome
his upper class prejudices. He was a real,</p>
<p t="4580670" d="4950">documentarian of the terrible working conditions
of working class people.</p>
<p t="4585620" d="4050">He wrote this book called Road to Wigan
Pier but one of the things that Orwell</p>
<p t="4589670" d="6600">said - he wrote this story about these poor
god damn coal miners, it's like yeah how about</p>
<p t="4596270" d="4920">some social legislation so that these people
and their children aren't absolutely brutalized</p>
<p t="4601190" d="5290">nonstop. But then he wrote the last half of
the book and he wrote it for the Left Book</p>
<p t="4606480" d="5040">Club which was a socialist group that would
publish a book every month or so. What he</p>
<p t="4611520" d="5520">did was, he wrote a critique of socialism
- of British socialism, and he said yeah this</p>
<p t="4617040" d="5040">sucks man. It's like we should be on the side
of the working people, but the socialists</p>
<p t="4622080" d="3900">I meet, they're not on the side of the working
people. They're like tweed wearing middle</p>
<p t="4625980" d="4870">class hyper intellectuals who never go anywhere
near the working class because of their class</p>
<p t="4630850" d="2060">prejudices and for all sorts of other reasons.</p>
<p t="4632910" d="5510">And they don't like the poor at all, they
just hate the rich. I thought - I had been</p>
<p t="4638420" d="3080">a member of the NDP for a long time at that
point and there's always something a little</p>
<p t="4641500" d="6140">off about it, especially the radical end like
what's with you guys? It doesn't look like</p>
<p t="4647640" d="4920">benevolence as far as I can tell. There's
a lot of whining and complaining and resentment.</p>
<p t="4652560" d="8880">What's that about? I read Orwell, and I thought
aha! Right. If you hate the successful, if</p>
<p t="4661440" d="3100">you hate the rich - rich by the way is whoever
has more money than you, but that's how you</p>
<p t="4664540" d="7350">define rich - and the best way to mask your
resentment is to pretend you're on the side</p>
<p t="4671890" d="6130">of poor. And I read that and thought, that's
exactly right. That's also what made me psychoanalytically</p>
<p t="4678020" d="7540">oriented because one thing psychoanalysts
always do, always, is if you say you're - here's</p>
<p t="4685560" d="7210">how I'm positively predisposed, the psychoanalyst
says, how are you using that to mask something</p>
<p t="4692770" d="8490">easy and malevolent you're doing? And that's
a very very useful question. It's not always</p>
<p t="4701260" d="3960">correct, but it's correct a lot more than
people generally like to think.</p>
<p t="4705220" d="4860">You know, it's like the mother - or the witch
- in Hansel and Gretel. You know this story</p>
<p t="4710080" d="5690">right? This guy gets married. He's got a couple
of kids, and his new wife doesn't really like</p>
<p t="4715770" d="6290">the kids. You have a hundred times higher
chance, by the way, of being abused by a stepparent</p>
<p t="4722060" d="5050">than by a biological parent - just so you
know. So the stepmother doesn't like the kids.</p>
<p t="4727110" d="2930">She tells the guy, well why don't you just
put those kids out in the woods. So out they</p>
<p t="4730040" d="5560">go, out in the woods. So they're lost kids,
right, they have nowhere to go. So they're</p>
<p t="4735600" d="5790">wandering out there in the forest. What happens?
They come across a gingerbread house. You</p>
<p t="4741390" d="6000">think wow, you're a starving kid. Gingerbread
house, that's good news right. Not only is</p>
<p t="4747390" d="6620">it a house, but it's made out of candy! How
could anything be possibly any better? So</p>
<p t="4754010" d="6400">in they go. Well and then there's this grandmotherly
type there and she starts to fatten them up.</p>
<p t="4760410" d="5940">She puts, I think it's Hansel, in a cage.
She gets Gretel, after a while, to basically</p>
<p t="4766350" d="3710">work as their scullery maid and it becomes
quite obvious to the children that she's actually</p>
<p t="4770060" d="3270">fattening them up so she can put them in the
oven and eat them.</p>
<p t="4773330" d="4400">And so, I think what Hansel does is I think
Gretel gives him like this bone from some</p>
<p t="4777730" d="4770">animal and the old witch is half blind, and
every time she reaches in to sort of reach</p>
<p t="4782500" d="5360">his leg, he gives her the bone and so she's
just not all that interested in eating him.</p>
<p t="4787860" d="3120">Anyway, the kids end up pushing her in the
oven and closing it, and getting the hell</p>
<p t="4790980" d="4510">out of there. So you know it's a happy ending,
as far as fairy tales go. But it's an Oedipal</p>
<p t="4795490" d="6770">story, right? It's a classic story, but an
Oedipal family. Be bloody wary of people who</p>
<p t="4802260" d="7220">do too much for you. Right. It's like if you
have a mother, or any other relative for that</p>
<p t="4809480" d="8320">matter who's fattening you up on mercy and
candy, the probability that her basic goal</p>
<p t="4817800" d="6780">is to eat you enough so that you never leave
- the probability is extraordinarily high.</p>
<p t="4824580" d="5730">And that's no joke. You know, one of the things
that you do learn if you read about the sorts</p>
<p t="4830310" d="4020">of people who burst out of their mother's
basement and go shoot up Dawson College is</p>
<p t="4834330" d="4860">often that's exactly the situation they've
been in. They're burning with resentment in</p>
<p t="4839190" d="4300">their uselessness down in the basement for
five or six year. They don't have to leave.</p>
<p t="4843490" d="4800">They don't have to become independent. Everything's
done for them, so they never have to do anything</p>
<p t="4848290" d="7100">for themselves. It's not pretty, and so one
of the rules for dealing with people - and</p>
<p t="4855390" d="7900">I know this is actually a rule for dealing
with elderly people in hopes for retired people</p>
<p t="4863290" d="3330">- is that do not do anything for anyone they
cannot do for themselves. You're stealing</p>
<p t="4866620" d="5220">from them when you do that. And it's a great
rule of thumb for kids. Once they can dress</p>
<p t="4871840" d="4330">themselves, they dress themselves. If they
can set the table, even if it takes twenty</p>
<p t="4876170" d="4860">minutes, it's like, they're setting the table.
You're not doing a favor by helping them do</p>
<p t="4881030" d="5370">anything they can do themselves. It's kind
of harsh, but it beats the hell out of the</p>
<p t="4886400" d="1490">witch in Hansel and Gretel</p>
<p t="4887890" d="5230">So anyways, one of the things we're going
to look at as well, is the dark side of positive</p>
<p t="4893120" d="9640">motivations. Now how are we gonna do this?
One of the things you might ask yourself is</p>
<p t="4902760" d="5220">how in the world do you know if something
is true? Now, the first thing I would suggest</p>
<p t="4907980" d="4960">is that the attitude you guys should bring
to this class is that nothing that I tell</p>
<p t="4912940" d="7230">you is true. Okay, now I don't mean you should
be arrogantly skeptical because that's not</p>
<p t="4920170" d="8610">appropriate. But, you should bring every critical
faculty you have to bear on what I tell you</p>
<p t="4928780" d="4430">to see if you can chip away at it because
what you want to do is you want to build yourself</p>
<p t="4933210" d="5800">a body of knowledge that you cannot undermine.
And the way you do that is by trying to undermine</p>
<p t="4939010" d="4220">it, by hacking away at the foundation with
everything you've got, and if the ideas can</p>
<p t="4943230" d="5970">withstand a total onslaught, then you've got
something. You've got a foundation. You've</p>
<p t="4949200" d="4940">got something you can stand on that's gonna
be there when things get rough.</p>
<p t="4954140" d="4840">So I'm gonna tell you what I found that's
been useful to me when things got rough, but</p>
<p t="4958980" d="5020">I don't expect you to assume that that's gonna
work for you, and I don't want you to - like</p>
<p t="4964000" d="5920">I want you to listen and to think, but I want
you to keep your wits about you. Now, I'm</p>
<p t="4969920" d="5400">gonna tell you how I go about to determine
whether something is true. Now first of all,</p>
<p t="4975320" d="9380">there's different definitions of truth. So
we're gonna flip back and forth between two.</p>
<p t="4984700" d="4440">One definition of truth is an objective definition,
but we don't have to talk much about that</p>
<p t="4989140" d="4440">cause you guys already know what that is;
but there's another definition of truth that</p>
<p t="4993580" d="5630">I think the best way of defining it is as
pragmatically true. Pragmatism is a branch</p>
<p t="4999210" d="4370">of American philosophy, and it's a very sophisticated
branch of philosophy. In fact, I actually</p>
<p t="5003580" d="3770">think it's the most sophisticated brand of
philosophy.</p>
<p t="5007350" d="5810">Probably because it makes the least claims.
What the pragmatists state, basically, is</p>
<p t="5013160" d="4520">well you really don't know anything. You don't
have ultimate knowledge about anything, so</p>
<p t="5017680" d="4340">your knowledge always bottoms out in ignorance.
So then the question is well, how do you know</p>
<p t="5022020" d="5640">then, if anything is true? And the pragmatists
would say, in a sense you don't. What you</p>
<p t="5027660" d="6190">know always is if something is true enough
for a particular function. So for example,</p>
<p t="5033850" d="4310">your theory about getting to the door might
be that you can stand up and walk there, and</p>
<p t="5038160" d="4080">you might - well god only knows what might
happen on the way there you know. Maybe there'll</p>
<p t="5042240" d="3450">be an earthquake, or a ceiling tile might
fall on you. Who knows? Maybe you'll have</p>
<p t="5045690" d="4990">a heart attack. So you don't know whether
you can get there; you can infer from past</p>
<p t="5050680" d="6210">experience, but if you get there then what
you can say is my statement about truth was</p>
<p t="5056890" d="5880">sufficient so that the outcome was what the
theory predicted. So in some sense, what the</p>
<p t="5062770" d="4220">pragmatists are saying is that every time
you make a statement, especially if it's related</p>
<p t="5066990" d="5760">to action, that you offer a theory of truth
along with that statement, implicitly which</p>
<p t="5072750" d="5770">is that this is true enough if what I predict
happens happens.</p>
<p t="5078520" d="5560">And so, it's a very nice theory eh? It doesn't
require you to be omniscient about anything</p>
<p t="5084080" d="4310">for things to be true enough, and you are
ignorant - you don't know everything about</p>
<p t="5088390" d="5550">anything, and so obviously you're working
in the world with partial knowledge, and it</p>
<p t="5093940" d="7180">works - not all the time. You get old, you
get sick, you die. You're not gonna work it</p>
<p t="5101120" d="7650">out thoroughly. So we're gonna use the pragmatic
truth framework and we're gonna use the objective</p>
<p t="5108770" d="5690">truth framework. And one of the propositions
that I'm going to make to you is that the</p>
<p t="5114460" d="10060">stories that are associated with our deepest
moral intuitions are pragmatic truths, and</p>
<p t="5124520" d="4260">that you need pragmatic truths and you need
objective truths, and you need pragmatic truths</p>
<p t="5128780" d="6730">because you don't just need to know what the
world's made of. You need to know what to</p>
<p t="5135510" d="5070">do about the fact that the world's made out
of things. And because human beings are motoric</p>
<p t="5140580" d="6020">creatures, we act in the world. We act on
the world, so what we need to know is how</p>
<p t="5146600" d="4280">is it that you should act on the world. That
is not a question that could be addressed</p>
<p t="5150880" d="4660">by objective methods. Technically right? Because
it's actually a value question. What should</p>
<p t="5155540" d="7040">you do? Science, by its very methodologies,
refuses to answer such questions.</p>
<p t="5162580" d="5810">People confuse the fact that science is value
free, sort of, with the idea that existence</p>
<p t="5168390" d="6030">is value free. Like that's philosophically
primitive, I would say, because science was</p>
<p t="5174420" d="5610">actually set up to get rid of the value of
this objective value in its technique. So</p>
<p t="5180030" d="5550">you can't say we set this thing up to get
the values and all the values fall. It's like</p>
<p t="5185580" d="8230">there's no value. No, no, you put that domain
out of the range of consideration. That doesn't</p>
<p t="5193810" d="8270">mean it doesn't exist. It's just a different
- it requires a different philosophy, a different</p>
<p t="5202080" d="5590">outlook, different techniques, different tools,
different methods of proof. All of these things.</p>
<p t="5207670" d="4780">So part of what we're gonna do - I'm gonna
use objective truth as much as I possibly</p>
<p t="5212450" d="6530">can because I think that a lot of what psychology,
as a science, has been able to offer in the</p>
<p t="5218980" d="5120">last hundred years has been extraordinarily
useful for elucidating some of the issues</p>
<p t="5224100" d="4210">that we're going to discuss. Because we really
have made some progress in understanding the</p>
<p t="5228310" d="6860">psyche, especially at a biological/behavioral
level. We got some pretty solid information,</p>
<p t="5235170" d="3980">it's not perfect but it's helpful.</p>
<p t="5239150" d="4270">So we're gonna draw on a bunch of sources.
We're gonna draw on stories. We're gonna draw</p>
<p t="5243420" d="3290">on literature. We're gonna draw on philosophy.
We're gonna draw on religion. We're gonna</p>
<p t="5246710" d="6340">draw on mythology. We're gonna draw on biology
and psychology. There's this idea which you</p>
<p t="5253050" d="2730">should've learned about - which you should've
learned about if you're a psychologist - called</p>
<p t="5255780" d="7180">multi method multi trait matrix. This was
invented back in the 1950's. I think it was</p>
<p t="5262960" d="4030">Meehl and Cronbach. It was a famous paper
that was published in the 50's. Everyone's</p>
<p t="5266990" d="5960">supposed to know it. No one ever pays attention
to it. But, what they were interested in is</p>
<p t="5272950" d="9430">how do you know if when you say that something
exists, like let's say anger, does anger exist?</p>
<p t="5282380" d="11300">Well, the answer seems self evident. It's
tricky because generally no one comes up to</p>
<p t="5293680" d="2950">you and says anger. They tell you a little
story where they use words related to anger</p>
<p t="5296630" d="5190">in the story and you sort of derive what they
mean by angry from the context.</p>
<p t="5301820" d="8670">The context is important in defining the reality,
so you don't know if the central idea, anger,</p>
<p t="5310490" d="5480">can be pulled out of the context and you can
say that's a thing like iron is a thing, or</p>
<p t="5315970" d="5030">like mercury is a thing. Maybe it's not. Maybe
it's a pattern or maybe it's something that</p>
<p t="5321000" d="4210">is a convention or you know, maybe there's
all sorts of things that are associated with</p>
<p t="5325210" d="8230">it. So, one of Cronbach and Meehl's fundamental
claims was that in order to determine whether</p>
<p t="5333440" d="5880">or not something existed, you had to be able
to detect it using different methods. Now,</p>
<p t="5339320" d="6100">it's tricky because it's not obvious what
constitutes a different method. So you kind</p>
<p t="5345420" d="4520">of have to make a judgment but I would say
you use a multi method, multi trait means</p>
<p t="5349940" d="7280">of determining what's true with your senses.
How many do you have? Six, because you have</p>
<p t="5357220" d="8390">proprioception. Why? Well let's say five,
for the sake of simplicity. Why? Why not one?</p>
<p t="5365610" d="5630">>>[Student answers: To increase the likelihood
of it being true. You could see something</p>
<p t="5371240" d="10430">but not touch it. That might be a mirage maybe.
So there's multiple reasons for it to be pointing</p>
<p t="5381670" d="1960">to the probability of it being true.]</p>
<p t="5383630" d="5110">>>Yes, well that's exactly it. And you want
it to be - so the sense idea is a really good</p>
<p t="5388740" d="4500">one because you can see sense uses different
modalities. It's like obviously the eyes rely</p>
<p t="5393240" d="5680">on electromagnetic radiation and the ears
rely on vibrations in the ear, and touch is</p>
<p t="5398920" d="5320">really an atomic phenomena in some sense because
you're feeling the outer surfaces of electrons</p>
<p t="5404240" d="5577">with your electron surfaces. There's taste,
which is again a molecular level phenomena. And smell.</p>
<p t="5410040" d="6740">So our idea kind of is, is if all five of
those things detect it, it's sufficiently</p>
<p t="5416780" d="5129">real so we can use it to guide our actions
and we won't be wrong. So it's five dimensions</p>
<p t="5421909" d="4521">- you need a five-dimensional analysis, and
that's evolved. You might say, well let's</p>
<p t="5426430" d="4660">call that a good estimate. You need five ways
of detecting something before you can be sure</p>
<p t="5431090" d="8000">it's true. Now you know, when you're learning
about experimental psychology, p is less than</p>
<p t="5439090" d="5510">0.05 and you use a measurement, and then you
determine whether the probability that that</p>
<p t="5444600" d="6500">has manifested itself exceeds a certain level
of chance. If it does, then the thing exists.</p>
<p t="5451100" d="6560">But that's actually not right. It's not right
for experimental psychology, and experimental</p>
<p t="5457660" d="4370">psychologists have known it since the late
fifties. You have to demonstrate the damn</p>
<p t="5462030" d="5860">thing exists multiple different ways. Now,
what constitutes a different way can be subject</p>
<p t="5467890" d="5500">to debate. It's a complicated thing to sort
out, but you can kinda figure it out right?</p>
<p t="5473390" d="4240">Maybe use a physiological measurement and
self report or something like that, or you</p>
<p t="5477630" d="5960">self report another report. Maybe you don't
need five, but you probably need three, or</p>
<p t="5483590" d="5160">something like that depending on the - so
what I'm going to do is tell you a story,</p>
<p t="5488750" d="5880">roughly speaking, and I wanna make the story
evident at five or six different levels of</p>
<p t="5494630" d="6080">analysis. And I want to show you how the story
is the same at all these levels of analysis.</p>
<p t="5500710" d="9860">Now, the one - one of the potential flaws
of that method is this. Joseph Campbell, for</p>
<p t="5510570" d="5320">example, wrote about hero mythology. Some
of you have probably read The Hero of a Thousand</p>
<p t="5515890" d="4370">Faces. One of the criticisms about Joseph
Campbell and people like him, is that they</p>
<p t="5520260" d="6660">read the stories of multiple cultures, but
they have an a priori framework. Because of</p>
<p t="5526920" d="5130">the a priori framework, they only see what
their theory tells them that they're going</p>
<p t="5532050" d="480">to see.</p>
<p t="5532530" d="5320">They don't look for the exceptions, so it's
a problem with pattern recognition. You may</p>
<p t="5537850" d="7030">be able to recognize patterns where they don't
exist. Now, my method could be criticized</p>
<p t="5544880" d="6200">on that grounds. But, the way I've tried to
protect myself against that was to make sure</p>
<p t="5551080" d="6520">I drew from enough sources so that the probability
I would be able to tell a coherent story across</p>
<p t="5557600" d="5360">all those different types of methods is vanishingly
small. Now you're going to have to decide</p>
<p t="5562960" d="9560">if that's true. I'll tell you roughly, the
dimensions of analysis. The ideas that I'm</p>
<p t="5572520" d="4440">going to talk to you about, I've put into
practice personally. They work for me. They</p>
<p t="5576960" d="3440">work for the people that I've taught them
to, so those are family members often, but</p>
<p t="5580400" d="4130">not only family members, lots of other people
because I'm also a clinician right? So it</p>
<p t="5584530" d="4580">seems to work quite nicely. I have a lot of
people write to to me and tell me the ideas</p>
<p t="5589110" d="10900">have worked. So, I've got multi rater reliability.
And then, I think it's manifest biologically,</p>
<p t="5600010" d="4750">and I think it's manifest culturally, and
I think it's manifested in these very, very</p>
<p t="5604760" d="9320">old stories and anthropologically and so forth.
You know, make up your own mind, you can see.</p>
<p t="5614080" d="3920">The other thing - I don't really know what
to do, what to make of this. You know sometimes</p>
<p t="5618000" d="5240">you have an intuition of truth. It's like
maybe you're describing a problem to someone</p>
<p t="5623240" d="4350">and they say this seems to be at the heart
of it. They give you a formulation, and it</p>
<p t="5627590" d="5690">kind of goes click. Yeah, that's how all those
things hang together. It's a pattern recognition</p>
<p t="5633280" d="6650">mechanism. People generally have the feeling
that when something like that happens, something</p>
<p t="5639930" d="7490">of truth has been revealed. Now, a very common
response from the students I had in these</p>
<p t="5647420" d="7380">courses is that I never tell anyone anything
they don't already know. And the reason for</p>
<p t="5654800" d="4230">that, what I'm hoping is the reason, is that
what I'm outlining is archetypal structures</p>
<p t="5659030" d="3500">and you know, I've drawn a lot of my work
from Jung and was very interested in archetypal</p>
<p t="5662530" d="4370">structures. So, what will happen - and I think
it will happen - is I'll tell you a story,</p>
<p t="5666900" d="3960">you'll think oh yeah right, that's what that
means, and I see in here all the things that</p>
<p t="5670860" d="4940">it explains. So you'll have this sense, and
that's the - we talked about your friend with</p>
<p t="5675800" d="6680">the spiritual awakening. Often, one of the
cognitive phenomena that accompanies a spiritual</p>
<p t="5682480" d="6800">awakening is the connections of many, many
diverse phenomena into an overarching unity.</p>
<p t="5689280" d="4510">And you feel that, like as a radical simplification.
It's something like that, a decrease in entropy,</p>
<p t="5693790" d="5400">or something like that. It's a very, very
powerful sensation. I mean, there's other</p>
<p t="5699190" d="5690">sources of what you might call spiritual experiences
as well, but that's certainly one of them.</p>
<p t="5704880" d="5900">And so you can see you know, I'll tell you
these stories; you can think oh well - how</p>
<p t="5710780" d="7290">does that story manifest itself in your experience?
That's a phenomenological level of truth.</p>
<p t="5718070" d="7240">So the phenomenologists - branch of philosophy
- started by Heidegger, not exactly but let's</p>
<p t="5725310" d="7750">say extended as well as anyone extended it,
by Heidegger. Heidegger thought that Western</p>
<p t="5733060" d="5570">philosophy had gone wrong basically since the
time of Socrates which is quite a long time.</p>
<p t="5738630" d="5470">And he said that we became interested in what
the world was made of, and how we knew things,</p>
<p t="5744100" d="6090">and what we should've been interested instead
was the nature and quality of being. What</p>
<p t="5750190" d="7150">he meant by being isn't the objective world.
What he meant by being was the manner in which</p>
<p t="5757340" d="6920">you have experience. So there are elements
of being that aren't objective elements.</p>
<p t="5764260" d="6540">So I would say pain is a phenomenological
reality. It's not something you can - you</p>
<p t="5770800" d="7520">can index it objectively, but the index is
not the phenomena. And you know, is your pain</p>
<p t="5778320" d="6750">real? This is a question for people who think
there's no such thing as meaning. Like you</p>
<p t="5785070" d="4060">try to argue yourself out of pain and see
how far you get. You might think, well that's</p>
<p t="5789130" d="3660">not the sort of meaning I meant. Well you
know, a negative meaning is a place to start</p>
<p t="5792790" d="4310">right? Because if something's negative and
it's real, it does imply that there's something</p>
<p t="5797100" d="4660">positive that's real. It might be harder to
get a hold of it, but at least it's not pain.</p>
<p t="5801760" d="10010">But, pain - Descartes, and I'll close with
this. You guys can have a break. Descartes</p>
<p t="5811770" d="4290">implemented a method called radical doubt
when he went on his philosophical journey.</p>
<p t="5816060" d="3270">What Descartes looked for was one thing he
couldn't doubt.</p>
<p t="5819330" d="2560">Cause he was probably clinically depressed</p>
<p t="5821890" d="5200">and he was doubting everything, like how do
I know the world isn't just a mirage made</p>
<p t="5827090" d="7590">by an evil demon to obfuscate reality from
me. Well his conclusion was that the one thing</p>
<p t="5834680" d="6750">that he could not dispute was that he was
and could think. Now I don't think Descartes</p>
<p t="5841430" d="7450">really meant what we meant by think. I think
he meant more by what we would mean by experience</p>
<p t="5848880" d="6950">because thought has become a much more narrowly
defined term since the time of Descartes.</p>
<p t="5855830" d="4370">So I don't think he meant I think therefore
I am, I think he meant something like I experience.</p>
<p t="5860200" d="5640">I have experience, therefore I am. Regardless
of that, modern people think about it as thought.</p>
<p t="5865840" d="5480">Heidegger was different. Heidegger basically
said, the one thing you can't dispute is that</p>
<p t="5871320" d="9080">experience is your experience. It exists.
It's almost by definition, it's like the definition</p>
<p t="5880400" d="1340">of exist.</p>
<p t="5881740" d="5920">And then he was interested in what the fundamental
elements of existence were. And they're not</p>
<p t="5887660" d="4700">atoms, like the fundamental elements of the
objective world. They're more things like</p>
<p t="5892360" d="6170">pain, and for me that was the thing that stopped
me from doubting. It's like, I cannot doubt</p>
<p t="5898530" d="6990">the existence of pain. It seems real. I might
say it seems more real than anything else.</p>
<p t="5905520" d="4010">Now, you might say you don't believe that,
but I would say I don't care what you think</p>
<p t="5909530" d="5210">you believe. I'll watch you when you're in
pain, and every single one of your actions</p>
<p t="5914740" d="4600">will indicate that you believe in it. And
not only that, but that you can't not believe</p>
<p t="5919340" d="6620">in it. It's there, and it's there so much
that that's a meaning.</p>
<p t="5925960" d="6480">And so it's in that way that Heidegger thought
out existence, or as experience as composed</p>
<p t="5932440" d="4440">of meaning. So part of the reason this course
is called Maps of Meaning is that because</p>
<p t="5936880" d="4450">one of the things we're going to look at is
the structure of meaning, and we're going</p>
<p t="5941330" d="4900">to start with negative meaning because from
my perspective - look you can doubt whether</p>
<p t="5946230" d="5530">or not good exists. But once I'm done telling
you the things that I know about human history,</p>
<p t="5951760" d="4350">there won't be a single person in this room
who thinks that evil doesn't exist. And you</p>
<p t="5956110" d="4790">might think that's a bloody horrible thing
to learn, but it's not. It's unbelievably</p>
<p t="5960900" d="7140">useful because once you can establish something
that you cannot deny, you can move from that.</p>
<p t="5968040" d="8050">I think you can hypothesize that if you're
capable of detecting radical evil, I'll tell</p>
<p t="5976090" d="6120">you about Unit 731, or you can look it up
yourself - I wouldn't recommend it by the</p>
<p t="5982210" d="1310">way.</p>
<p t="5983520" d="4840">Once you can identify radical evil and you
think, well that's just - beyond a doubt that's</p>
<p t="5988360" d="5690">reprehensible. There's no justification for
that whatsoever, no matter what, whenever.</p>
<p t="5994050" d="3290">Well then you've got something to stand on,
and you can start thinking, well what's the</p>
<p t="5997340" d="5210">absolute opposite of that thing? It might
be, how is it that you can conduct yourself</p>
<p t="6002550" d="6040">so that in your sphere of influence, the probability
that anything like that is reduced to the</p>
<p t="6008590" d="6620">absolute maximum? Well, that's a reasonably
moral question. And I don't think it's something</p>
<p t="6015210" d="6000">you can dispense with with a casual nihilism.
I don't think a nihilist can dispense with</p>
<p t="6021210" d="8570">it, because even nihilists suffer. Thank god
for that. It's their only source of potential</p>
<p t="6029780" d="4410">salvation. Sometimes they notice it - oh I'm
suffering from all this nihilism, maybe that</p>
<p t="6034190" d="4820">indicates there's something flawed in it.
It's always possible.</p>
<p t="6039200" d="5195">Okay, so let's take a break. We will come back at, what time is it?</p>
<p t="6044560" d="1696">2:58</p>
<p t="6046377" d="7311">2:58? Okay. Come back at 3:15. We will see you then. And then I will talk to you more about the technical elements of the class.</p>
