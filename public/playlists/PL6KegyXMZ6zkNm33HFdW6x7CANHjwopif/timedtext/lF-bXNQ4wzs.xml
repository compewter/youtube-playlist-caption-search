<p t="5290" d="6160">If you don't have anything to look up to,
you don't have anything to do, right?</p>
<p t="11450" d="5640">A lot of the meaning that people find in their
lives is purpose driven.</p>
<p t="17090" d="6349">And in order to put effort into something,
to work towards something, you have to assume</p>
<p t="23439" d="2911">axiomatically that what you're working towards
is better than what you have.</p>
<p t="26350" d="2570">Because why else would you do it?</p>
<p t="28920" d="3650">And there's a relationship, like, if it's
way better than what you have, it's obviously</p>
<p t="32570" d="1340">proportionally difficult.</p>
<p t="33910" d="5770">So you try to balance difficulty with positivity,
let's say, something like that.</p>
<p t="39680" d="2570">But you're always aiming up if you're
aiming.</p>
<p t="42250" d="3480">And if you're not aiming then you don't
really have any purpose, and that deprives</p>
<p t="45730" d="4020">your life of meaning, and that's not good
because if your life is deprived of meaning</p>
<p t="49750" d="2010">then what you're left with is the suffering.</p>
<p t="51760" d="2750">It's not neutral, right, it's negative.</p>
<p t="54510" d="7520">So now the problem with having to aim up is
that produces a hierarchy, because if you</p>
<p t="62030" d="7581">posit and aim then everyone arrays themselves
along a hierarchy of “better at it” to</p>
<p t="69611" d="2029">“worse at it”.</p>
<p t="71640" d="7730">And it doesn't matter—if you create basketball
as a game, 100 years later you create people</p>
<p t="79370" d="4210">who are hyperspecialized at basketball and
they're great at it, and virtually everyone</p>
<p t="83580" d="1740">else is bad.</p>
<p t="85320" d="1000">So it doesn't matter.</p>
<p t="86320" d="4160">As soon as you produce a value proposition,
you produce a hierarchy.</p>
<p t="90480" d="3800">The problem with a hierarchy is it produces
inequality.</p>
<p t="94280" d="2960">The problem with inequality is it produces
resentment.</p>
<p t="97240" d="4340">Right, but you can't get rid of the damn
hierarchy just because they produce inequality</p>
<p t="101580" d="2300">and resentment, because then you don't have
anywhere to go.</p>
<p t="103880" d="2180">So that's not an answer.</p>
<p t="106060" d="4770">Okay, so let's say you're trying to deal
with the fact that you have to put up with</p>
<p t="110830" d="1700">a hierarchy if you're going to have any
values.</p>
<p t="112530" d="3560">Well, how do you escape from the resentment
trap?</p>
<p t="116090" d="4240">And the answer is you do an intelligent multidimensional
analysis of your life.</p>
<p t="120330" d="5810">It's like, by the time you're 30, I would
say, you're a pretty singular person.</p>
<p t="126140" d="5409">You're unique and particular and your life
has multiple dimensions.</p>
<p t="131549" d="4381">And you're more or less successful—or
not—along many of those dimensions.</p>
<p t="135930" d="5419">But it's a completely ridiculous game to
pick someone else arbitrarily, who's doing</p>
<p t="141349" d="4991">much better than you on one of those dimensions,
to assume that you're a failure because</p>
<p t="146340" d="5060">of that, or that the world is unfair because
of that, without knowing in full detail all</p>
<p t="151400" d="1759">of the rest of the elements of their lives.</p>
<p t="153159" d="7741">I mean, look, we're absolutely awash in
stories of unhappy celebrities mired in interminable</p>
<p t="160900" d="4550">divorces or in affairs or in addictions.</p>
<p t="165450" d="1879">And that's par for the course.</p>
<p t="167329" d="1441">It's not helpful.</p>
<p t="168770" d="2169">It's helpful to have a goal.</p>
<p t="170939" d="2190">It's necessary to have a hierarchy.</p>
<p t="173129" d="5140">It's not particularly useful to compare
yourself to other people.</p>
<p t="178269" d="2110">But it is useful to compare yourself to yourself.</p>
<p t="180379" d="2181">That's the right baseline, right?</p>
<p t="182560" d="2849">That takes everything else into account.</p>
<p t="185409" d="2160">And it's really practically useful.</p>
<p t="187569" d="2291">And I've done this in my clinical practice
very frequently.</p>
<p t="189860" d="5749">It's like okay, let's take stock of where
you are and then let's hypothesize about</p>
<p t="195609" d="1000">where you would like to be.</p>
<p t="196609" d="4080">It's a complex conversation because we want
to figure out what's not so good about your</p>
<p t="200689" d="5281">present situation—exactly, precisely—and
then come up with a hypothesis about what</p>
<p t="205970" d="2980">your life would look like if it was better.</p>
<p t="208950" d="2069">And then we can work on incremental improvement.</p>
<p t="211019" d="6860">And the idea would be there's some step
you could take, that you would take, that</p>
<p t="217879" d="5991">would make today or tomorrow fractionally
better than yesterday.</p>
<p t="223870" d="1750">And then you can iterate that.</p>
<p t="225620" d="2310">And that's actually unbelievably powerful.</p>
<p t="227930" d="4739">You hit the effect of compounding interest,
let's say, very, very rapidly if you do</p>
<p t="232669" d="1000">that.</p>
<p t="233669" d="2921">So there's real utility in incremental progress.</p>
<p t="236590" d="4399">And you don't have to improve your life
much in increments to start hitting the effect</p>
<p t="240989" d="1930">of compounding interest.</p>
<p t="242919" d="4820">You make one thing slightly better, and that
increases the probability that you'll make</p>
<p t="247739" d="4500">the next thing slightly better—as well as
having its positive side effects.</p>
<p t="252239" d="4671">And so even if you make small steps forward
and you do that regularly, that can turn your</p>
<p t="256910" d="3380">life around very rapidly over a one- to two-year
period.</p>
<p t="260290" d="3630">I mean, that's a long time, one to two years,
but it's not a lifetime.</p>
<p t="263920" d="4180">And it certainly beats the hell out of going
downhill precipitously, which tends to be</p>
<p t="268100" d="1750">the alternative.</p>
<p t="269850" d="4110">It's better and it keeps you out of the
resentment, you know.</p>
<p t="273960" d="6600">It's also more realistic because it's
not like everyone else doesn't have their</p>
<p t="280560" d="1000">problems.</p>
<p t="281560" d="6010">You know, we have these fictitious, successful
people that it's easy for us to compare</p>
<p t="287570" d="4750">ourselves to detrimentally and to become jealous
and bitter about that, but also to be very</p>
<p t="292320" d="3800">hard on ourselves because we're not successful.</p>
<p t="296120" d="4720">If you talk to successful people, let's
say—and I'm not trying to say that there's</p>
<p t="300840" d="5450">no such thing as genuine accomplishment because
obviously there is—but even people who are</p>
<p t="306290" d="7150">successful have lives that are very difficult,
and they have an ill family member or aged</p>
<p t="313440" d="4720">parents or they're suffering from some serious
illness themselves which is very, very common.</p>
<p t="318160" d="3900">Or they have a psychological problem that's
not trivial or they have traumatic past.</p>
<p t="322060" d="2350">It's like—life is brutal.</p>
<p t="324410" d="6070">And becoming resentful about your relative
position is a way to make it more brutal.</p>
<p t="330480" d="2580">It's not helpful to you, and it's not
helpful to anyone else.</p>
