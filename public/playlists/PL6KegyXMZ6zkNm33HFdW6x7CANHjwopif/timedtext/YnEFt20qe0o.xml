<p t="640" d="2449">apologies for my prolonged absence</p>
<p t="3670" d="3799">I've been dealing over the last few weeks with my somewhat Shaky current health</p>
<p t="8019" d="3470">It seems probable that I can use arrest if I had the opportunity</p>
<p t="12519" d="3980">And I knew how I [should] probably be having a rest right now</p>
<p t="17170" d="5029">But be that as it may I have prepared this letter presumptuously to the world</p>
<p t="22900" d="7129">Or at least to that corner of it with which I can communicate here at the dawn of the new year in these perilous times</p>
<p t="31630" d="2119">Although I usually speak extemporaneously</p>
<p t="35050" d="5750">That takes a level of capacity that I cannot quite currently manifest, so I'm going to read instead</p>
<p t="41980" d="6110">It's also a careful argument. [I] hope and it required the editing for which only the written word can suffice</p>
<p t="50820" d="2000">Dear World</p>
<p t="53199" d="3800">On January sixteenth, I'm going to talk with Sam Harris on his podcast</p>
<p t="57910" d="7100">Waking up with Sam Harris Dr.. Harris is one of the so-called new atheists of which there are four</p>
<p t="66250" d="2479">like the other three Christopher hitchens</p>
<p t="69760" d="7789">Dan Dennett and Richard Dawkins who by the way. I always wanted particularly to debate Dr.. Harris is a smart guy</p>
<p t="78610" d="3559">And I'm certainly not complaining that [I] will encounter him instead of Darkens</p>
<p t="83740" d="7010">So I'm preparing my arguments carefully although. I have been doing so for years the specific ideas. I'm going to share with you today</p>
<p t="91780" d="2659">We're obsessing me from the moment. I woke up</p>
<p t="95170" d="2000">Somewhat fitfully this morning</p>
<p t="98229" d="5029">So I dictated them to my son and then edited them with his help</p>
<p t="105880" d="5000">The central problem of human beings isn't religion as the new atheists insist</p>
<p t="112299" d="2000">[it's] tribalism</p>
<p t="114880" d="5690">We know this in part because Chimps are closest biological can go to war</p>
<p t="121210" d="1979">And they're not religious</p>
<p t="123189" d="2000">Although they are tribal</p>
<p t="125229" d="3740">Tribalism also has a central problem, and it's not competition</p>
<p t="130030" d="4430">Despite the tendency of competition to produce at least temporary early winners and losers</p>
<p t="137770" d="2539">The problem of tribalism is cooperation</p>
<p t="141340" d="6229">Because cooperation is what allows us to exist is bounded groups group by definition is a collective</p>
<p t="148060" d="4970">Cooperatively aiming at something it can't be aimed at nothing because nothing cannot unite</p>
<p t="154150" d="2000">It only divides</p>
<p t="157390" d="5600">Thus attacks on collective purpose because of its tendency to Produce tribalism merely divide</p>
<p t="165430" d="5209">The politics of identity which emerged when the central purpose is criticized to destructively?</p>
<p t="171220" d="3919">Inevitably produce the situation described in the story of the tower of babel</p>
<p t="176380" d="6500">Everyone fragments into primitive tribes and speaks their own mutually in comprehensible language</p>
<p t="184930" d="7520">One alternative to fragmentation is of course union under a banner a collective ideal cause or purpose</p>
<p t="194070" d="7019">The problem with uniting under a banner as the postmodernists to push identity politics rightly point out is that to value something?</p>
<p t="201700" d="1980">means simultaneously</p>
<p t="203680" d="2000">to Devalue other things</p>
<p t="206590" d="2990">And thus to value is an exclusionary process</p>
<p t="213100" d="4489">But the alternative is valueless pneus which is equivalent to nihilism</p>
<p t="219100" d="2419">Denialism does not produce freedom from exclusion</p>
<p t="222790" d="8000">It just makes everyone excluded and that's an intolerable state direction. 'less uncertain chaotic and Angst-ridden</p>
<p t="232930" d="2390">When such uncertainty reaches a critical level</p>
<p t="235959" d="2000">the counter Response appears</p>
<p t="238540" d="1710">first the unconscious</p>
<p t="240250" d="5929">and then the collectively express demand for a leader possessed by the spirit of totalitarian certainty</p>
<p t="246580" d="2750">Who promises above all to restore order?</p>
<p t="251620" d="6350">The Society without a unifying principle oscillates on Lord between Nihilism and totalitarianism</p>
<p t="259209" d="3410">Human beings have been wrestling with this problem since the beginning of civilization</p>
<p t="263470" d="5389">In our capacity to form large groups for all its advantages also started to pose a new threat</p>
<p t="269650" d="2420">that of the hyper domination of the state</p>
<p t="272740" d="4550">Collective or purpose, but without the state. There's just fragmentation into smaller groups</p>
<p t="278980" d="2059">the group itself cannot be done away with</p>
<p t="281669" d="5490">Because for better or worse human beings are social animals not loners like Sharks are tigers</p>
<p t="288250" d="1800">We're team players</p>
<p t="290050" d="2540">But being on one team means not being on others</p>
<p t="293370" d="2459">this means that any given team sidelines</p>
<p t="296260" d="5149">Marginalizes and alienates those who cannot play their game as well as conflicting with other teams</p>
<p t="302050" d="5390">In the west starting in the middle east thousands of years ago a new idea began to Emerge</p>
<p t="308530" d="2000">Evolved is not too strong a word</p>
<p t="310690" d="6829">In the collective imagination you might following darkens consider this a mean although. This is far, too weak a word</p>
<p t="319419" d="6950">This idea whose development can be traced back through egypt to mesopotamia before disappearing into unwritten history</p>
<p t="327550" d="2119">Is that of the divine individual?</p>
<p t="331900" d="2329">This eons old work of the imagination</p>
<p t="334960" d="2000">is a dramatic</p>
<p t="337030" d="2000">presentation of an emergent idea</p>
<p t="339520" d="6800">Which is the solution to how to organize social being without falling prey to nihilistic divisive pneus or deceitful?</p>
<p t="347080" d="2000">totalitarian certainty</p>
<p t="349270" d="2000">the group must unite</p>
<p t="351850" d="2029">but under the banner of the individual</p>
<p t="355210" d="4220">The [individual] is the source of the new wisdom that updates the antiquated</p>
<p t="360010" d="4250">nihilistic or totalitarian D'Ãªtre tests and Glory of the past</p>
<p t="367000" d="2000">for better or for worse</p>
<p t="370690" d="2599">That idea reaches its apogee and Christianity</p>
<p t="374890" d="5119">The Divine individual is Masculine because the feminine is not individual</p>
<p t="381400" d="2990">The Divine Feminine is instead mother and child</p>
<p t="386229" d="6440">However, it is a hallmark of Christian supposition that the redemption of both men and women comes through the masculine</p>
<p t="393789" d="2290">And that's because the masculine is the individual</p>
<p t="398740" d="2000">the Central realization</p>
<p t="401360" d="6980">[Express] dramatically and symbolically is that the subordination of the group to the ideal of the divine individual?</p>
<p t="408919" d="3710">Is the answer to the Paradox of Nihilism and totalitarianism?</p>
<p t="414500" d="4069">The divine individual is the man that every man admires</p>
<p t="419690" d="3019">and a man who all women want their men to be</p>
<p t="424580" d="6529">The divine individual is the ideal from which deviations are punished by the group with contempt and disgrace</p>
<p t="431630" d="4519">And finality to which is rewarded by the group with attention and honor</p>
<p t="437389" d="3140">The divine individual is not the winner of any individual game</p>
<p t="441229" d="7190">But the player who plays fairly and is therefore continually invited to play the divine individual is the builder</p>
<p t="448880" d="5419">Maintainer an expander of the state he who boldly goes where no man has gone before</p>
<p t="455090" d="3470">And someone who eternally watches over the windows and the children</p>
<p t="460430" d="4070">His power of Direct and honest communication is that which identifies?</p>
<p t="465139" d="4459">discusses and then resolves the continuum urgent problems of human existence</p>
<p t="471050" d="4070">It is for this reason that he is regarded as the savior of the world</p>
<p t="478820" d="6589">The primary image for women is not the divine individual because of the heavy burden they bear for reproduction</p>
<p t="485659" d="3080">It is instead the divine mother and child</p>
<p t="489289" d="6890">[this] is not to say that man is the divine individual and woman is not although such confusion is understandable</p>
<p t="496580" d="2000">given the complexity of the problem</p>
<p t="499909" d="4730">Man like women have the divine mother and child as an element of their personality</p>
<p t="505460" d="3170">In man however, it's in the background, so to speak</p>
<p t="510500" d="3349">as the divine individuals in the background of the psyche for women</p>
<p t="514940" d="3619">men by Necessity play less primary Role in the care of Children</p>
<p t="520039" d="5960">This frees them to act as individuals in a manner that up to now has been nearly impossible for women</p>
<p t="528829" d="7250">Identification with these images is belief in the belief is not the statement of agreement with a set of facts</p>
<p t="536079" d="5520">But the willingness to act something out to become something to stake your life on something</p>
<p t="543350" d="5780">for men and women alike this means voluntary adoption of responsibility</p>
<p t="550880" d="5209">responsibility for oneself Family and State</p>
<p t="557600" d="6229">It's in that responsibility and not in rights that meaning itself resides</p>
<p t="565310" d="2000">the meaning that makes life bearable</p>
<p t="570230" d="7789">Societies that refused to honor both of these elements therefore doom their inhabitants to purposelessness unhappiness sterility</p>
<p t="579529" d="7910">And the out for mention dangers of nihilistic to visit pneus and deceitful oppressive totalitarian certainty</p>
<p t="589519" d="3980">The meaning and responsibility is the necessary meaning in life</p>
<p t="595160" d="3830">Which can serve as a counterbalance to its terrible fragility and tenuous?</p>
<p t="600560" d="7339">people must unite under the banner not of their group and not of nothingness, but of the individual</p>
<p t="610220" d="6500">This is a brilliant and intrinsically paradoxical solution to the problems of nihilistic nothingness</p>
<p t="617360" d="2989">and too rigid group identity alike</p>
<p t="624319" d="7040">[it's] the consciousness of the individual which transforms the Chaos of potential [into] habitable cosmos</p>
<p t="632389" d="3140">as the greatest origin stories repeatedly insist</p>
<p t="637069" d="4910">It is that same consciousness which stands up rebellious and revelatory?</p>
<p t="643160" d="6470">To break down the pathological and too rigid order of that cosmos when it has become old</p>
<p t="650269" d="2780">Infirm Willfully blind and corrupt</p>
<p t="655130" d="6619">It is that consciousness. Which is the image of [God] dwells within every embodied human form</p>
<p t="663260" d="2000">the fact of its existence</p>
<p t="665470" d="2099">Is the reason that the law of the land itself?</p>
<p t="668210" d="6049">Must be bound by ultimate respect for the individual regardless of his or her sins and crimes</p>
<p t="676730" d="2839">It is that consciousness not the objective</p>
<p t="680120" d="3769">Material substrate of being which should be regarded as the ultimate reality</p>
<p t="684110" d="6789">There's no self-evident reason why Dead matter should be given ontological primacy over living spirit</p>
<p t="693230" d="4339">Although doing so has produced a massive increase in human technological power</p>
<p t="698390" d="4429">Is left that power in the hands of an increasingly disenchanted [populace]?</p>
<p t="703970" d="2000">And that presents a mortal danger</p>
<p t="708170" d="6109">Such power must be wielded by those who have truly and voluntarily accepted the responsibility of being</p>
<p t="715280" d="2000">less [to] [Prove] Fatal</p>
<p t="720560" d="5239">The west has long being the civilized embodiment of the idea of the divine individual</p>
<p t="726530" d="2000">Who does exactly that?</p>
<p t="729110" d="4880">That's what the voluntary lifting of the cross of suffering symbolically represents</p>
<p t="736490" d="6109">For all its faults which are manifold the west has therefore served as a shining beacon of hope</p>
<p t="745640" d="7580">To those destined to inhabit places too chaotic or too rigid for the human spirit to tolerate</p>
<p t="754130" d="6200">About the west is in grave danger of losing its way the negative consequences of this can hardly be overstated</p>
<p t="761390" d="4460">a close reading of 20th century history indicates as nothing else can</p>
<p t="766610" d="2000">the horrors that accompany</p>
<p t="771110" d="2000">loss of Faith in the idea</p>
<p t="774710" d="2000">of the individual</p>
<p t="778310" d="3709">It is only the individual after all who suffers</p>
<p t="783920" d="2539">The group does not suffer</p>
<p t="799869" d="2000">Only those who compose it</p>
<p t="804610" d="4819">That's the reality of the individual must be regarded as primary</p>
<p t="810639" d="1831">of suffering</p>
<p t="812470" d="2209">Is to be regarded seriously?</p>
<p t="819369" d="6290">Without such regard there can be no motivation to reduce suffering and therefore no respite</p>
<p t="827559" d="4309">instead the production of individuals suffering can and has</p>
<p t="835420" d="7969">And will be again rationalized it justified for its supposed benefits for the future</p>
<p t="845110" d="2000">and the group</p>
<p t="855810" d="5210">Effective birth control has emerged as one of the consequences of our powerful technological materialism</p>
<p t="862530" d="3169">This has been accompanied by the rise of [state] sufficiently</p>
<p t="865890" d="5599">Civilized so that women who inhabit them can walk the streets unaccompanied Din safety</p>
<p t="871950" d="5719">We do not yet know how to balance the opportunities that's provided for expanded female individuality</p>
<p t="877950" d="5210">With the eternal necessity for a woman to serve as the mother of the divine individual</p>
<p t="883680" d="7970">Dividing our civilization into polarized ideological camps of female group identity and male group identity is certainly not the answer</p>
<p t="893250" d="5270">We have to be honest male and female alike about what we really want as individuals</p>
<p t="899220" d="1550">And talk it out</p>
<p t="900770" d="6899">We [don't] beyond dispute. The [Society's] whom emancipate their women are more productive and peaceful and that the relationship is causal</p>
<p t="909750" d="2270">Thus it's not a matter of if but how</p>
<p t="914430" d="7640">But such amounts of emancipation places a dual burden on the now more autonomous woman who is required to balance?</p>
<p t="922620" d="2179">manifesting the potential of our individual spirit</p>
<p t="925830" d="4849">With the necessity of desire to Bear and rear the next generation of mankind</p>
<p t="931770" d="2000">to live with [free] women</p>
<p t="934050" d="3049">And gain the advantages of their freedom and sophistication</p>
<p t="938040" d="6139">Man must therefore bring their shadows psychic identification with the divine mother and child into the light</p>
<p t="944820" d="3229">without losing their divine individuality in the process</p>
<p t="949080" d="2000">They must consciously</p>
<p t="951150" d="2479">voluntarily deliberately and strategically</p>
<p t="954270" d="5539">Accept their responsibility for the relationship between Autonomous female companionship</p>
<p t="960450" d="4330">support love and the responsibility of producing out next generation</p>
<p t="965670" d="6350">This means rejecting among other things the misbegotten idea of casual sexual gratification</p>
<p t="975180" d="6049">Sex is either the impulsive Short-term gratification of a domineering biological instinct</p>
<p t="982230" d="5119">Or the Union of two conscious spirits taking responsibility for what they are doing</p>
<p t="989100" d="4549">The former is simply not commensurate with the demands of an advanced civilization</p>
<p t="994499" d="4880">Which requires the adoption of responsibility above all for its preservation?</p>
<p t="1000170" d="2000">maintenance and expansion</p>
<p t="1002379" d="1810">It is for this reason</p>
<p t="1004189" d="5510">That the sexualized interactions between young men and women in universities for example</p>
<p t="1010610" d="4549">Are increasingly and inevitably falling under the Harsh and tyrannical?</p>
<p t="1015860" d="2000">regulation of the State</p>
<p t="1021199" d="2330">In the west we are as well</p>
<p t="1024439" d="2000">Shuttering are great cathedrals</p>
<p t="1026750" d="1620">those marvelous</p>
<p t="1028370" d="5390">monumental embodiments of the idea of the Divine individual which our civilization is based</p>
<p t="1036530" d="3079">This is no mirror practical material matter</p>
<p t="1041659" d="4070">It's a symbolic and mediation process whose importance cannot be overstated</p>
<p t="1048110" d="4969">Without that central idea we will dissolve and be lost</p>
<p t="1056480" d="7489">It is time for each of us to consciously realize what the great symbolic stories of the past insist upon</p>
<p t="1065390" d="4640">That we are all sons and daughters of the divine logos consciousness itself</p>
<p t="1071419" d="2000">bearers of its light</p>
<p t="1073940" d="5660">And that we must act in accordance with that great central fact last all hell break loose</p>
<p t="1082490" d="4489">This means above all to tell the truth and to care for one another</p>
<p t="1088010" d="5059">Starting at the level of the individual and proceeding from that out to the broader reaches of society itself</p>
<p t="1093890" d="3439">The alternative as the same stories have always insisted</p>
<p t="1098630" d="3140">Is the more permanent instantiation of the horror?</p>
<p t="1102620" d="7479">That we already saw a manifest in multiple forms in the last bloody terrible century</p>
<p t="1115040" d="5849">We need to wake up individual man and woman alike [now]. We need to do it now</p>
