<p t="2030" d="8800">So while you guys were gone, I went on Wikipedia
and looked up Osiris, because when I did the</p>
<p t="10830" d="4979">research for this book it certainly wasn't
possible to get access to that kind of information</p>
<p t="15809" d="5131">instantaneously. And the stories that are
laid out in there… there's a thread that</p>
<p t="20940" d="4010">runs the stories that are laid out there,
that's quite similar to the one I told you,</p>
<p t="24950" d="4840">but there's all sorts of details that are
very radically different. And so, I don't</p>
<p t="29790" d="4720">really know what to say about that. And you
know, part of the reason that people like</p>
<p t="34510" d="7060">Joseph Campbell and Carl Jung and… there
was an original anthropologist, an armchair</p>
<p t="41570" d="5040">anthropologist, who wrote a book called The
Golden Bough, whose name escapes me momentarily</p>
<p t="46610" d="2769">[it's Sir James George Frazer], but it was
one of the first attempts to do a cross-cultural</p>
<p t="49379" d="5531">categorisation of mythology, and to look for
underlying commonalities. Now the problem</p>
<p t="54910" d="4640">is, you know I told you about Naomi Klein
going down to Argentina and looking at the</p>
<p t="59550" d="5230">factory through her particular lens. The problem
is that when you develop a lens and then you</p>
<p t="64780" d="4470">look at things through it, you may just see
what that lens heightens, you know, and I</p>
<p t="69250" d="5140">think that's a criticism that could be leveled
against the sorts of things that I'm telling</p>
<p t="74390" d="4500">you about. You know, that I've cherry-picked
certain stories and interpreted them in certain</p>
<p t="78890" d="6970">ways so that they fall coherently into a scheme
of thought. And so I'll tell you some of</p>
<p t="85860" d="5619">the things that I do methodologically to protect
myself against that, insofar as that's possible.</p>
<p t="91479" d="8320">So there is this idea in psychology called
the multimethod-multitrait method of construct</p>
<p t="99799" d="7070">validation, which is, you know, a God-awful
agglomeration of jargon. But it actually means</p>
<p t="106869" d="6221">something. And it was the construction of
two psychologists back in the late 1950s,</p>
<p t="113090" d="5110">Cronbach and Meehl, who were interested in
what psychologists meant when they said something</p>
<p t="118200" d="7150">existed. Like say, anger. Is that a real thing?
Well what do you mean, ‘thing'? What is</p>
<p t="125350" d="4019">it that you're talking about? What is anger,
exactly? I don't mean as ‘anger', but</p>
<p t="129369" d="5790">as an idea. What sort of idea is the idea
of anger or the idea of anxiety or the idea</p>
<p t="135159" d="5461">of sadness? Or the idea of self-esteem or
self-competence or any of these things that</p>
<p t="140620" d="6699">psychologists talk about as if they're realities.
Well, some realities are very tangible, right,</p>
<p t="147319" d="5802">and it's somewhat easy to come to agreement
about the contours of their existence, and</p>
<p t="153121" d="6829">the borders, but other things are way more
difficult than that. And so their idea was</p>
<p t="159950" d="4459">that if something actually existed, you should
be able to measure it multiple ways, using</p>
<p t="164409" d="6601">multiple techniques, and still get the same
answer. And so, your senses do that. You have</p>
<p t="171010" d="4420">five of them. And the reason you have five,
apparently, is because evolution has determined</p>
<p t="175430" d="5560">that if you only had four you'd die more
often. So it seems as if you have five separate</p>
<p t="180990" d="6469">sources of information that all lead to the
same conclusion. You can be relatively certain</p>
<p t="187459" d="7211">that the conclusion's that reached is real.
Well, the multimethod-multitrait method is</p>
<p t="194670" d="6010">an application of that idea to construct validation,
which is like… you could think of anger</p>
<p t="200680" d="5809">as an idea, as a construct, it's a terminological
issue. You just define it as a construct,</p>
<p t="206489" d="4580">a psychological construct. How do you know
if they're real? Well the idea is it's</p>
<p t="211069" d="4821">very complicated. You have to measure them
in multiple ways. All the ways you measure</p>
<p t="215890" d="6760">them have to give the same reading. Then you
have to show that that idea is the same in</p>
<p t="222650" d="4750">certain ways as other ideas that it's related
to and different from other ideas that it's</p>
<p t="227400" d="7520">not related. So let me give an example. There's
a construct: ‘neuroticism'. And you might</p>
<p t="234920" d="5100">say, well there's another construct: ‘depression'.
Well then you might say, “well are those</p>
<p t="240020" d="7360">separate or are they the same?” Well that's
a tough one, because in many, many ways they're</p>
<p t="247380" d="5970">the same. Are they different in any important
ways? Well, the way you do that technically</p>
<p t="253350" d="5000">is you would measure neuroticism however you
were going to measure it. Maybe I'd have</p>
<p t="258350" d="3930">you tell me how neurotic you were using a
questionnaire, and then I'd have your friend</p>
<p t="262280" d="4990">tell me and maybe your parent, so we've
got a pretty good triangulation on your neuroticism.</p>
<p t="267270" d="5420">Then I have them do the same thing, all those
people do the same thing with regards to your</p>
<p t="272690" d="5680">levels of depression and anxiety. Then I'd
use both those measures to predict something</p>
<p t="278370" d="8990">else, like how well your life goes in terms
of career over the next ten years. And if</p>
<p t="287360" d="3670">neuroticism predicted and depression predicted,
so they were correlated, then I'd think</p>
<p t="291030" d="5250">well there's some relationship. Then I'd
look at them at the same time. If I predict</p>
<p t="296280" d="7470">with neuroticism and then I add depression
to the mix, does that give me more predictive</p>
<p t="303750" d="7000">power. It's sort of like does A = C or does
A + B = C? That's all you're asking in</p>
<p t="310750" d="7630">a regression equation, roughly speaking. Well
if A = C is just as good as A + B = C, especially</p>
<p t="318380" d="5810">if the two things are also correlated (depression/anxiety
and neuroticism are going to be very highly</p>
<p t="324190" d="5150">correlated, like 0.7, something like that),
you might say well those are the same things.</p>
<p t="329340" d="5770">Just because they have different names, it's
not helped. And part of it is, it's a pragmatic</p>
<p t="335110" d="5990">conceptualisation of reality, it's like,
is this categorisation structure good for</p>
<p t="341100" d="4550">something?
Okay, so anyways, I'll unpack all that and</p>
<p t="345650" d="4790">say, well part of my rules for determining
whether these things were useful or not was</p>
<p t="350440" d="5140">to see if the ideas apply across multiple
levels of analysis. So that's why I told</p>
<p t="355580" d="4350">you about the conceptual, so that's sort
of the cognitive psychology, and then the</p>
<p t="359930" d="7570">neuropsychological, so there's some input
of brain research. And then the narrative</p>
<p t="367500" d="5349">or mythological, and then the cross-cultural
and think well those all stack up in a certain</p>
<p t="372849" d="4561">way so that if you look between all of them
you can see a pattern. And it seems to me</p>
<p t="377410" d="5970">increasingly unlikely that that pattern would
be there across all of those levels at the</p>
<p t="383380" d="6039">same time. Now you could say well, you know
that depends on how good you are at weaving</p>
<p t="389419" d="9071">a story. But at some point, encapsulating
that many phenomena and weaving a coherent</p>
<p t="398490" d="5649">story out of them if such a thing doesn't
exist, it seems to me to become cognitively</p>
<p t="404139" d="6530">impossible. You just can't do it unless
there's actually something there. And of</p>
<p t="410669" d="4911">course everything I tell you also is a simplification.
It has to be. Because you could spend your</p>
<p t="415580" d="4110">whole life investigating any of the things
we're talking about and so what I'm hoping</p>
<p t="419690" d="6690">is I've extracted out the central issues
of these multiple levels of analysis and put</p>
<p t="426380" d="9469">together, each of them support all the others.
Anyways, who knows? You know, I don't know,</p>
<p t="435849" d="5341">but so far so good. Okay so this is a cool
representation, I really like this one. This</p>
<p t="441190" d="6610">is called The Open Virgin. And it's a 14th
or 13th century sculpture, if I remember correctly.</p>
<p t="447800" d="4011">It's made out of wood. And these things
were actually… this isn't the only one</p>
<p t="451811" d="7429">of them. They were a form of religious interpretation
that had different exemplars. You could find</p>
<p t="459240" d="5670">different ones of them online. This is brilliant,
this bloody thing, as far as I'm concerned.</p>
<p t="464910" d="7439">So let me show you this figure again. So basically
what you have here, in this figure, this is</p>
<p t="472349" d="5720">a world conception. And the world conception
is roughly: there's an individual, positive</p>
<p t="478069" d="7171">and negative, he or she is in a cultural sphere
that's positive or negative, that's embedded</p>
<p t="485240" d="4330">in the world outside of culture, that's
positive and negative, and all of it comes</p>
<p t="489570" d="8520">from potential. That's the idea.
Now, this map shows all of the positives and</p>
<p t="498090" d="4120">negatives in relationship to one another,
and you see it's not perfectly symmetrical</p>
<p t="502210" d="5239">and the reason for that is, as far as I can
tell, the adversarial element of the individual</p>
<p t="507449" d="5471">is the thing that generates the tyrannical
element of culture. And that's the thing</p>
<p t="512920" d="9020">that gets in your way of establishing a creative
relationship with what you don't know. Well,</p>
<p t="521940" d="9130">anyways. Here is a manifestation of that,
I believe. And I like this manifestation because…</p>
<p t="531070" d="7620">like, it's obviously Christian, but not
exactly. It's more mythological than Christian.</p>
<p t="538690" d="9450">And the reason for that, well, is quite obvious.
So the superordinate figure is Mary, the feminine.</p>
<p t="548140" d="4510">Now you think, well it's amazing the person
who carved this didn't get burnt up at the</p>
<p t="552650" d="6180">Inquisition, because it's a radical idea,
but it's just an indication of how the mythology</p>
<p t="558830" d="4090">can change the causal relationship between
these different elements.</p>
<p t="562920" d="6750">So you have Mary there, she's the ultimate
in femininity, the ultimate feminine deity,</p>
<p t="569670" d="7990">but only the positive side. And then within
her, so it's like Nature opens itself up,</p>
<p t="577660" d="5950">benevolent Nature opens itself up, and what
you see inside is culture, that's God the</p>
<p t="583610" d="6390">Father, holding the individual, and the individual
in this case is the crucified Christ, which</p>
<p t="590000" d="4410">is a wonderful conceptualisation as far as
I'm concerned, because of course that is</p>
<p t="594410" d="5650">what life does to people, that's why that's
such a powerful symbol. It's like, you know,</p>
<p t="600060" d="6460">Christ is the person who has to face the reality
of his own death, voluntarily or involuntarily,</p>
<p t="606520" d="6740">who's betrayed by his culture, betrayed
by his friends, it's sort of like he's</p>
<p t="613260" d="8280">exposed to the most torturous elements of
individual being. And simultaneously, at least</p>
<p t="621540" d="3090">in principle, transcends them. Well it's
like you bloody well better do that because</p>
<p t="624630" d="5290">otherwise, well what's going to happen?
You're done if you don't do that. And</p>
<p t="629920" d="5340">it's even worse, it's not only that you
fail, that's just the beginning of it. If</p>
<p t="635260" d="6120">you can't transcend the tragedy of your
being then you get corrupted. I see this happening</p>
<p t="641380" d="6770">to people happening all the time.
So you know, if you're suffering and you</p>
<p t="648150" d="8730">can't cope with it, generally speaking what
happens is that it embitters you. And once</p>
<p t="656880" d="5020">you get bitter you get resentful, and once
you get resentful you look for revenge. And</p>
<p t="661900" d="5400">that can just get completely out of hand.
Now that's a quick trip to the worst suburb</p>
<p t="667300" d="6140">of the Underworld, that's for sure. So you
know, it's not only that if you don't</p>
<p t="673440" d="6370">manage this transcendent act that you're
swamped by the tragedy of your life. You're</p>
<p t="679810" d="4790">swamped by the tragedy of your life, and then
that corrupts you, and then you start working</p>
<p t="684600" d="6360">to make everything even more tragic than it
has to be. And so I think that's why in</p>
<p t="690960" d="7960">medieval Christian conceptualisations in particular,
the idea of hell, the idea that you were destined</p>
<p t="698920" d="4461">to hell was worse than the idea of dying.
And it's a strange idea, you know, because</p>
<p t="703381" d="3949">you think (this is what the terror management
theorists think too) is that “there's</p>
<p t="707330" d="3630">nothing worse than the fear of death!” It's
like, that's wrong. They don't have the</p>
<p t="710960" d="7430">right imagination. There are lots of things
that are worse than the fear of death. I'm</p>
<p t="718390" d="7130">not trying to trivialise the fear of death,
obviously, but I don't think it's very</p>
<p t="725520" d="5370">difficult to understand that there are some
things that you would rather die than do.</p>
<p t="730890" d="5550">I mean I'm sure that I could get you guys
to sit for fifteen minutes and say okay, list</p>
<p t="736440" d="5810">ten things that you would rather die than
do. That's easy. Especially if you're</p>
<p t="742250" d="3680">a parent. You can think of those things in
like no time flat.</p>
<p t="745930" d="5000">Okay so that's pretty interesting. So you've
got the superordinate feminine figure here,</p>
<p t="750930" d="3900">which is not what you would expect from a
Christian representation, right? You'd expect</p>
<p t="754830" d="3920">God to be on the outside, and then Mary and
then Christ, in all likelihood, although that</p>
<p t="758750" d="6550">would also be a valid representation. Because
you can think of the mother as something that's</p>
<p t="765300" d="5250">protected by the culture. And supporting the
individual, because that's basically what</p>
<p t="770550" d="5790">this representation shows. But then you see
on the open sides, I really like this, I think</p>
<p t="776340" d="4930">it's so cool, is that you've got all these
people who aren't archetypal figures, they're</p>
<p t="781270" d="4940">in a little crowd. And they're gazing at
the central figure. And of course that's</p>
<p t="786210" d="3410">exactly what's happened in Christianity
for two thousand years, right, insofar as</p>
<p t="789620" d="4590">it has spread, is that for two thousand years
people have been looking at that image, which</p>
<p t="794210" d="9080">is the crucifixion, transfixed by it. Well
why? Well, you know, for reasons that we don't</p>
<p t="803290" d="6120">understand. When everybody woke up in the
late 1800s and said, “why were we looking</p>
<p t="809410" d="4650">at that for the last two thousand years?”
the first answer was “well we really don't</p>
<p t="814060" d="5680">have the foggiest idea”. It was just one
of the things that we did, roughly speaking.</p>
<p t="819740" d="5650">It encapsulated people within the belief system.
So that's another good example, anyway,</p>
<p t="825390" d="5030">of how this archetypal imagery can manifest
itself, say spontaneously, in the imagination</p>
<p t="830420" d="7450">of an artist. And the thing is, that's a
sacred image. And it is an actuality, that's</p>
<p t="837870" d="7050">what it is. What it shows is, well there's
a superordinate, transcendent, natural order</p>
<p t="844920" d="4620">that has a beneficial element that we associate
with femininity, and inside that there's</p>
<p t="849540" d="5081">a supportive culture that's properly nested
if things are organised properly. And it's</p>
<p t="854621" d="4899">both of those things that provide support
for the suffering individuals. It's like</p>
<p t="859520" d="6770">yeah, that's pretty much got it. Now that
doesn't exhaust the meaning of this particular</p>
<p t="866290" d="6080">representation, there's a lot more to it
than that, but just that is not so bad.</p>
<p t="872370" d="5750">And then, you know I can show you a more negative
representation, I think I've shown you this</p>
<p t="878120" d="6870">before. Like this would be a representation
of the negative element of the feminine. And</p>
<p t="884990" d="6890">so you have Kali here, and Kali is the goddess
to whom you make sacrifices and hopefully</p>
<p t="891880" d="5440">if you make the right sacrifices, then Kali
turns into her positive counterpart. And you</p>
<p t="897320" d="6670">know, you think, well that's a… what…
how does sacrifice affect your relationship</p>
<p t="903990" d="3270">with the gods? Well first of all there's
no gods and second of all, well then what</p>
<p t="907260" d="4700">the hell are you doing with the sacrifices?
But it's pretty straightforward. We've</p>
<p t="911960" d="5890">already talked about this at length. You do
make sacrifices, all the time. And what that</p>
<p t="917850" d="6570">means is that you act as if you can have a
relationship with being. You assume that if</p>
<p t="924420" d="5470">you withhold certain things from yourself
now, that you will improve your relationship,</p>
<p t="929890" d="5360">both with nature and with culture. And I already
told you guys that as far as I was concerned</p>
<p t="935250" d="6790">that was the most stunning cognitive discovery
of mankind. It's the discovery of the future.</p>
<p t="942040" d="4190">And it's the discovery of the relationship
between the present and the future. You know</p>
<p t="946230" d="4532">it's such an amazing idea, that you can
alter your behaviour now, and it'll pay</p>
<p t="950762" d="6098">off in a year. God, that's not obvious.
It's certainly not… animals don't think</p>
<p t="956860" d="4660">that way. You know, some of them act that
way, like bees and so on, but that's just</p>
<p t="961520" d="3720">built right into their behaviour, as far as
we can tell.</p>
<p t="965240" d="6670">So anyway, so there's Kali. And you know,
she's a spider. She's in a web of fire.</p>
<p t="971910" d="6210">The fire is outside a web that's made out
of skulls. She's got weapons in her hand,</p>
<p t="978120" d="4490">her hair is on fire. She's got a headdress
of skulls. I mean, if you ever saw something</p>
<p t="982610" d="3190">like that it would traumatise you so badly
you wouldn't be able to get out of your</p>
<p t="985800" d="4990">house for like five years. That's exactly
what it is. That's what it is. It's a</p>
<p t="990790" d="6640">representation of all of that that would traumatise
you if you encountered it. And you know, it's</p>
<p t="997430" d="4180">an attempt to encapsulate that as an image,
and what you could say, in some sense, is</p>
<p t="1001610" d="5890">that the people who developed this image were
attempting to conceptualise the class of all</p>
<p t="1007500" d="5700">terrifying things. And once you get the class
of all terrifying things conceptualised, you</p>
<p t="1013200" d="5130">could come up with the class of all useful
responses. And that would be something like</p>
<p t="1018330" d="6870">the proper way to behave, and sacrifice is
an integral element of that. It's like yeah,</p>
<p t="1025200" d="5280">absolutely. Absolutely dead on. Unless you
don't believe that sacrifice works, in which</p>
<p t="1030480" d="4680">case, what the hell are you doing here? I
mean, you know, you act out your belief. And</p>
<p t="1035160" d="5280">it's a firm belief. And you would also say
that if things fell apart so badly that sacrifice</p>
<p t="1040440" d="5580">no longer paid off, your life would basically
become intolerable. Because it would mean</p>
<p t="1046020" d="5920">that you would have abandoned all sense of
control over the outcomes of your actions.</p>
<p t="1051940" d="8110">Well you can't live like that, you'd just
die of stress. Well and as I said, she was</p>
<p t="1060050" d="4390">pregnant, she's given birth to this unfortunate
character, who she's devouring intestines</p>
<p t="1064440" d="5810">first. Like it's a rough image. It's an
image of the destructive element of nature.</p>
<p t="1070250" d="5500">And so that's the negative side of the feminine,
we might say.</p>
<p t="1075750" d="13700">There's a positive representation. This
is a Greek representation. That's Diana,</p>
<p t="1089450" d="8820">or Artemis. I'm hoping I'm remembering
this properly. She's multi-breasted. This</p>
<p t="1098270" d="8550">circle around her head is undoubtedly a representation
of her cosmic nature. So it's like a halo</p>
<p t="1106820" d="7610">but the halo is basically a planetary body
like the Sun… a cosmic body like the Sun</p>
<p t="1114430" d="5570">or the Moon behind the head of the divine
individual with all of that power shining</p>
<p t="1120000" d="4440">forward. So it's an attempt to use… you
know, if you look up at the Moon or you look</p>
<p t="1124440" d="4920">up at the Sun, there's an element that's
characterised by awe. You can't help but</p>
<p t="1129360" d="5460">feel that, at least its beauty and power,
and sometimes it's overwhelming. Well, you</p>
<p t="1134820" d="5520">take the representation of the personality
and you throw the representation of these</p>
<p t="1140340" d="6690">cosmic powers behind it, and it's an attempt
to represent transcendent value. It's very</p>
<p t="1147030" d="5260">intelligent. It's brilliant, in fact. And
so partly what you're trying to do as you</p>
<p t="1152290" d="5330">conduct your life is you're trying to get
all of these archetypal forces in proper balance.</p>
<p t="1157620" d="6990">And I suppose in some sense to get them tilted
towards the good, if that's possible. I</p>
<p t="1164610" d="13600">mean, that's what this representation in
some sense, you might say… [looks for picture]…</p>
<p t="1178210" d="7280">yeah, you might say well if you got everything
ordered properly, this is what being would</p>
<p t="1185490" d="7680">be like. Still pretty rough, given that the
crucifix is at its centre.</p>
<p t="1193170" d="6450">Now I don't know, you know, if you think
about it from a purely technical perspective,</p>
<p t="1199620" d="5370">roughly speaking, each of these archetypes
is split into positive and negative. You might</p>
<p t="1204990" d="7880">say, well, that's just how it is. There
is no way that you can interact with all of</p>
<p t="1212870" d="8350">them so that the whole system tilts towards
the positive, you know. But I don't think</p>
<p t="1221220" d="4800">that's true. I think you can get them lined
up so that things tilt towards the positive.</p>
<p t="1226020" d="4740">And I think you can detect when that happens,
because those are the periods in your life</p>
<p t="1230760" d="5000">where you feel that you're richly enough
engaged in what you're doing and life is</p>
<p t="1235760" d="6520">meaningful enough, so that the rest of it,
the substructure that makes it necessary,</p>
<p t="1242280" d="5770">is worth it. It's worthwhile, you know,
that the negative exists is okay given the</p>
<p t="1248050" d="5770">way that things are structured.
Now I think that whether or not that's true</p>
<p t="1253820" d="8800">is in some sense the eternal question of mankind.
Can you organise your life so that it's</p>
<p t="1262620" d="7040">good? Well, it seems like you can certainly
allow your life to degenerate so that it's</p>
<p t="1269660" d="3770">terrible. That seems indisputable, right,
and there does seem to be an element of choice</p>
<p t="1273430" d="6420">in that, although, you know something terrible
can happen to you that you have no choice</p>
<p t="1279850" d="5450">of or control over. But it certainly seems
that you could do any number of stupid and</p>
<p t="1285300" d="4760">blind things that make everything worse. I
think that's common experience. And I also</p>
<p t="1290060" d="5100">think you'd be hard-pressed to find anyone
who wouldn't say that there were things</p>
<p t="1295160" d="5971">they did consciously and willingly, that were
of their own choice, that they didn't have</p>
<p t="1301131" d="7019">to do, that made things worse. So we seem
to have some sense of our moral agency. And</p>
<p t="1308150" d="5330">we seem automatically to accept some responsibility
for the outcomes of our actions. And so partly</p>
<p t="1313480" d="4170">what that means is that we do believe that
we can make things better or worse. And I</p>
<p t="1317650" d="5170">suppose in some way that means that we believe
we can tap the whole archetypal structure</p>
<p t="1322820" d="14090">of being into the positive. Well I would say
if you drill down to the bottom of existentialism,</p>
<p t="1336910" d="4760">in some sense, that's the question that
the existentialists pose, you know. Is there</p>
<p t="1341670" d="5610">a manner of conducting your life such that
it becomes… it's not merely acceptable,</p>
<p t="1347280" d="8650">it's more than that. You'd say yes, this
is how it should be.</p>
<p t="1355930" d="3740">What we're going to do now, although we're
not going to do it today, is we're going</p>
<p t="1359670" d="5350">to start talking about other representations
of this sub-structure from other religious</p>
<p t="1365020" d="5370">traditions. And we're going to also talk
about ways that you might relate to these</p>
<p t="1370390" d="5810">figures. Because one question might be, well
you're part of your culture, and it's</p>
<p t="1376200" d="5430">got an orderly element, and a protective element,
and a tyrannical element. Okay so what should</p>
<p t="1381630" d="6900">you do about that? You know, should you…
the tyrannical element is real and it's</p>
<p t="1388530" d="4310">corrupt and blind, and so to the degree that
you identify with that, when you're tyrannical</p>
<p t="1392840" d="5040">and corrupt and blind, but by the same token
you're the fortunate beneficiary of tens</p>
<p t="1397880" d="7450">of thousands of years of cultural and technological
evolution and effort. And it seems to me that,</p>
<p t="1405330" d="5191">you know, you should be at least appropriately
grateful for that. And so then you're in</p>
<p t="1410521" d="5009">a real position, because you have to be grateful
and happy for the thing that tyrannises and</p>
<p t="1415530" d="5370">controls you. Well, okay, that's not an
easy thing to figure out, because those things</p>
<p t="1420900" d="6870">seem to conflict. So what exactly should your
relationship to culture be? Well, I think</p>
<p t="1427770" d="7060">there are myths that describe that quite directly.
And they take into account the corruption.</p>
<p t="1434830" d="7610">It's not a whitewash. It's like yes of
course this thing is dead and blind and corrupt.</p>
<p t="1442440" d="7900">Obviously. And you know, it's foolishness
and wilfulness… it's ignorance and wilful</p>
<p t="1450340" d="5350">blindness that make it that way, as well as
things merely getting old and falling apart.</p>
<p t="1455690" d="4050">So the fact that there's some malevolence
at the bottom of it is also true. Should you</p>
<p t="1459740" d="7280">flee from that? Well, that isn't what the
myths say. They say what you're supposed</p>
<p t="1467020" d="4440">to do is, just like Pinocchio, you're supposed
to go to the bottom of the ocean, to the most</p>
<p t="1471460" d="5430">monstrous possible part, and rescue your father.
That's what you have to do before you become</p>
<p t="1476890" d="7520">an individual.
And I can't see how that can't be right.</p>
<p t="1484410" d="5630">In fact, I think that's what you're doing
in university, if you're actually getting</p>
<p t="1490040" d="5800">a university education. What you're here
to do is sift through the dead remnants of</p>
<p t="1495840" d="5930">the past and pull up what's vital, that's
so sophisticated and complex that there's</p>
<p t="1501770" d="3800">no way that you'd be able to think it up
for yourself. But you know, it requires you</p>
<p t="1505570" d="5550">as the discriminating agent. You know, if
you read someone like Nietzsche or you read</p>
<p t="1511120" d="4840">someone like Freud, there's lots to throw
away. It isn't what you throw away though,</p>
<p t="1515960" d="4610">it's what you keep that matters. And to
be a discriminating reader means that you</p>
<p t="1520570" d="5690">get rid of the dead matter and you keep the
gold. And you build yourself up a storehouse</p>
<p t="1526260" d="8180">of gold, and then you can live in the world.
And people often ask, what's the purpose</p>
<p t="1534440" d="5830">of getting a degree in the humanities? Well
the answer to that is that if you're properly</p>
<p t="1540270" d="7039">trained in the humanities, you know how to
live. Now that's the same as having a job,</p>
<p t="1547309" d="5731">and you need to have a job. But you know,
knowing how to live is a more important thing</p>
<p t="1553040" d="5850">than having a job, even though having a job
is an important thing. And the reason for</p>
<p t="1558890" d="5880">that is that if you don't know how to live
then things fall apart. And that's not good.</p>
<p t="1564770" d="5160">And they can really fall apart, you know,
and part of the reason I think that this became</p>
<p t="1569930" d="7360">so much of an obsession for me is that I believe
that we don't have a lottery of… we are</p>
<p t="1577290" d="12010">narrowing… we've become so powerful that
the consequence of our blindness is reaching</p>
<p t="1589300" d="4590">uncontrollable proportions. If you're weak
and stupid, well you know, there's only</p>
<p t="1593890" d="6990">so much damage you can do. But we're not
weak, not at all. We have unbelievable power</p>
<p t="1600880" d="5170">at our disposal now, and a lot of weird things
are going to come down the pipes in the next</p>
<p t="1606050" d="6020">ten years.
The more people that have their act together,</p>
<p t="1612070" d="8680">the better. Because then things will be tilted
towards everything lining up in a positive</p>
<p t="1620750" d="4781">direction rather than being tilted in the
other direction. And that's important. And</p>
<p t="1625531" d="5239">I think people can make a very powerful individual
contribution to that, wherever you happen</p>
<p t="1630770" d="10909">to be. You know, all of these myths always
say the same thing. They say that the future</p>
<p t="1641679" d="9481">of the world depends on individual choice.
And I think that's literally true. So then</p>
<p t="1651160" d="3930">you might think, well you better put yourself
in a position where you make wise choices,</p>
<p t="1655090" d="8150">because if you don't… we've already
seen what happens. We got a taste in the 20th</p>
<p t="1663240" d="8650">century. So, if you want some more of that,
you could certainly have it.</p>
