<p t="2020" d="1799">So I</p>
<p t="3819" d="2000">Want to recommend a book first?</p>
<p t="6310" d="3530">To everyone here. It's called explaining post-Modernism, [and]</p>
<p t="10660" d="2569">it's by a gentleman named Steven Hicks and</p>
<p t="14080" d="1979">You need to understand post-Modernism</p>
<p t="16059" d="1851">Because that's what you're up against</p>
<p t="17910" d="6359">and you're up against it far more than you know or think and it's a much more [well-developed] and</p>
<p t="25660" d="2359">Pervasive Pernicious nihilistic</p>
<p t="28660" d="2449">intellectually attractive doctrine than</p>
<p t="31960" d="4099">has yet come to public realization it absolutely dominates the</p>
<p t="36399" d="6590">Humanities and increasingly the social sciences [and] universities, and what's happening? You see someone once said who?</p>
<p t="43600" d="6380">unfortunately, I can't remember it might have been friedrich Nietzsche said that everybody is the unconscious exponent of a dead philosopher and</p>
<p t="51309" d="3560">Fortunately the post modern Philosophers most of them are dead, so that's a good thing</p>
<p t="55360" d="810">but</p>
<p t="56170" d="6740">That doesn't mean that their words aren't continually being spoken by people who who are following in their wake like saying it's not like any</p>
<p t="62910" d="4109">Given person is absolutely possessed and saved by the spirit of post-Modernism</p>
<p t="67210" d="5300">Because often they're not educated enough to know all the [details] about what it is that has them in their grip</p>
<p t="73150" d="1759">but if you get 20 of them together</p>
<p t="74909" d="3300">And they're all 5% influenced by the post Modernist</p>
<p t="78210" d="4559">Ethos you basically have the spirit of the mob that's a mouthpiece for [that] particular</p>
<p t="82990" d="2690">philosophical doctrine and if you understand the doctrine</p>
<p t="85840" d="6529">Then you understand why things are progressing the way that they're progressing and so I'm going to tell you a little bit about the doctrine</p>
<p t="93549" d="6680">Because it's not optional to understand this it's absolutely crucial to understand this huh you can't underestimate</p>
<p t="100540" d="5419">The power of ideas and also the power of words of course because ideas are expressed in words</p>
<p t="105960" d="6089">But you see the post modernists completely reject the structure of western Civilization</p>
<p t="112049" d="7200">And I mean completely so I can give you an example in one term jacques, Derrida whose head trickster for the Post Modernist movement</p>
<p t="119890" d="5239">Regarded western culture, let's call it the Patriarchy as a logo centric, okay?</p>
<p t="125130" d="3269">So fallow comes from Phallus Pha, lL</p>
<p t="128399" d="5890">[oh], and so that's the insistence that what you see in Western Culture is the constant of a male-dominated</p>
<p t="134960" d="1950">Oppressive</p>
<p t="136910" d="2660">Self-Serving society and we might say well</p>
<p t="139570" d="6149">you know societies do tend to be self-serving and people in power do tend to Act in their best interests, but a</p>
<p t="146390" d="4910">Tendency is not an absolute, and that's one of the things that needs to be considered continually</p>
<p t="151300" d="6960">There are no shortage of flaws in the manner in which we've structured our society and compared to any hypothetical utopia</p>
<p t="158260" d="1240">It's and that's absolutely</p>
<p t="159500" d="4190">Dismal wreck but compared to the rest of the world and the plight of other</p>
<p t="163790" d="2809">Societies throughout the history of Mankind we're doing pretty damn well</p>
<p t="166670" d="3080">And we should be happy to be living in the society that we're living in</p>
<p t="172460" d="7429">So the first thing that you might want to note about post-Modernism. Is that it doesn't [have] [a] shred of gratitude, and there's something</p>
<p t="180440" d="2720">Tautologically wrong with the person who does that it doesn't have any gratitude?</p>
<p t="183440" d="5600">Especially when they live in what so far is the best of all possible worlds, and so if you're not grateful</p>
<p t="189040" d="6989">You're driven by resentment and resentment is the both the worst emotion that you can possibly experience apart from Arrogance resentment</p>
<p t="196160" d="3199">Arrogance and deceit there is an evil Triad for you</p>
<p t="199360" d="4830">And if you're bitter about everything that's happening around you despite the fact that you're bathed in wealth</p>
<p t="204190" d="5729">And there's something absolutely wrong with you. You know the black community in the united states is the 18th wealthiest community</p>
<p t="210080" d="6889">18th wealthiest nation on the Planet now that doesn't mean there isn't such a thing as relative poverty and relative poverty matters</p>
<p t="217100" d="1139">It's an important</p>
<p t="218239" d="2060">It's an important political economic issue</p>
<p t="220300" d="5220">And it's very very difficult to deal with but absolute wealth matters too and the western Societies have been</p>
<p t="225709" d="1981">Absolutely remarkable in their ability to generate</p>
<p t="227690" d="6979">And distribute wealth as you can tell by just looking around and taking a you know a brief bit of consideration for the absolute miracle</p>
<p t="234670" d="2000">That even a building like this represents</p>
<p t="236720" d="6619">So you have to [educate] yourself about post-Modernism [ok] so here's what the post modernists believe they don't believe in the individual</p>
<p t="243340" d="5010">That's the logos [Park] Western Culture is Fel logo Centric Logo is logos</p>
<p t="248510" d="6470">That's partly the Christian word, but it's also partly the root word of logic [ok] they don't believe in logic</p>
<p t="255230" d="3289">they believe that logic is part of the process by which the</p>
<p t="259130" d="7369">patriarchal institutions of the west continue to dominate and to justify their dominance they don't believe in dialogue the</p>
<p t="266740" d="1829">Word of dialogue is logos again</p>
<p t="268569" d="7350">They don't believe that people of goodwill can come to consensus through the x through the exchange of ideas [they] believe that that</p>
<p t="276289" d="2000">notion is part of the</p>
<p t="278539" d="1051">philosophical</p>
<p t="279590" d="2029">substructure and practices [of] the dominant culture</p>
<p t="281900" d="5510">So the reason they don't let people who they don't agree with speak on [campuses] because they don't agree with letting people</p>
<p t="287810" d="1220">Speak you</p>
<p t="289030" d="4649">See it's not part of the ethos [ok] so, what else do they believe and not believe?</p>
<p t="293990" d="5450">They believe that you since you [don't] have an individual identity your fundamental identity is [group] fostered</p>
<p t="299440" d="2069">and that means that you're basically an</p>
<p t="301699" d="8000">Exemplar of your race hence white privilege or you're an exemplar of your gender or [your] sex or your ethnicity or you're an exemplar of?</p>
<p t="310190" d="500">however</p>
<p t="310690" d="6359">You can be classified so that use you are placed in the position of victim against the oppressor</p>
<p t="317360" d="3770">Because that's the game and it's it's [a] it's a post marxist</p>
<p t="321380" d="7399">[sleight-of-hand] right the old Marxist notion was that the world was a battleground between the burgeois [z] and the [proletariat] [and] that</p>
<p t="329720" d="2000">failed to have any</p>
<p t="332000" d="2239">philosophical or ethical standing that</p>
<p t="334550" d="7399">Argument after the working class actually saw its standard of living massively elevated as a consequence of western corporate democracy</p>
<p t="343310" d="2000">[Western] free Enterprise Democracy</p>
<p t="345710" d="7040">And also the end and also as a consequence of the revelations of everything terrible that had happened in every bloody country that ever</p>
<p t="352940" d="2299">dared to make equity and and</p>
<p t="355759" d="7370">the Marxist Communist [dogma] part of their fundamental structure right and nothing but murderous [Nozanne] depression and so by the</p>
<p t="363500" d="4669">1970s it was evident that that game was up the postmark the post Modernist Marxist</p>
<p t="368169" d="4860">just barely basically pulled a sleight of hand and said ok if it's not the poor against the rich it's the</p>
<p t="373460" d="5989">Oppressed against the oppressor will just read of I'd the subpopulations in ways that make our our bloody</p>
<p t="379940" d="6469">Philosophy continuing it's in its in its movement forward and that's where we're at now and so for the post modernists</p>
<p t="386409" d="3270">The world is a Hobbesian battleground of identity groups</p>
<p t="389680" d="3089">They do not communicate with one another because they can't</p>
<p t="393080" d="5240">All there is is a struggle for power and if you're in the predator group which means you're an oppressor</p>
<p t="398320" d="2789">Then you better look out because you're not exactly well come</p>
<p t="401630" d="6769">Not exactly welcome and neither are your ideas, so [that's] what you're up against. [I] would say it's time for conservatives to stop</p>
<p t="409009" d="2690">apologizing for being conservatives no and</p>
<p t="418130" d="5149">You don't apologize to these people that's a big mistake apology there. They read apology as</p>
<p t="423919" d="2180">An admission of guilt [you] don't apologize</p>
<p t="426139" d="1411">And you don't back down</p>
<p t="427550" d="2000">you young people that are out [there] who are</p>
<p t="429680" d="5209">[University] students you need to take over the student unions you need to take them back because they're absolute snake pits</p>
<p t="434889" d="2000">And they have been since the 1990s</p>
<p t="441830" d="2270">with regards with regards to the universities</p>
<p t="444100" d="5160">I thought at one point that the best thing [to] do would be to cut their funding by [25] percent let them fight amongst themselves</p>
<p t="449260" d="4559">For the remnants because it would force the universities to decide exactly what's important</p>
<p t="453820" d="4979">and what isn't so I would say the humanities and much of the social sciences has turned into a</p>
<p t="459110" d="6950">Postmodern neo-Marxist playground for radicals the scholarship is terrible 80% of humanities papers aren't cited once</p>
<p t="466760" d="5029">Once and so what that means is that they write papers for each other and they sell them to libraries</p>
<p t="471789" d="2580">[and] that's how the publishers make their money. No one reads them</p>
<p t="474370" d="5429">but the publishers can print them because the libraries have to buy them and they're buying them with your tax money and so all of</p>
<p t="479800" d="1899">You who are sitting here are?</p>
<p t="481699" d="1771">funding a</p>
<p t="483470" d="1229">Postmodern Radical</p>
<p t="484699" d="2120">neo-Marxist Agenda that has its roots in the</p>
<p t="486919" d="4820">university and your tax money is going towards that and if you want proof of that you just go online and</p>
<p t="491870" d="7489">Look at the websites especially of disciplines like women's studies. Which is pathological right to the core, but it's not just women's studies</p>
<p t="499360" d="2000">It's all the ethnic studies groups</p>
<p t="503570" d="5089">it's anthropology its sociology its social work and most of all it's</p>
<p t="508940" d="6260">Education and oszi for example in Ontario is perhaps apart from the Ontario human rights commission the most dangerous</p>
<p t="515419" d="2000">institution in Canada [it] should</p>
<p t="520449" d="1680">It should be defunded</p>
<p t="522129" d="6619">It's as simple as that [they] don't do the research they purport to do they're not interested in it at all in education</p>
<p t="528749" d="6570">They're interested in the indoctrination of people as young as they can [fun] as young as they can get their hands on so to speak</p>
<p t="535689" d="3830">[now] we need to figure out our society needs to figure out how [to] stop</p>
<p t="539980" d="5329">shunting public tax money to radical Left-wing activists if we were doing that for radical Right-wing</p>
<p t="545529" d="5869">Activists there would be an absolute storm, but it's happened incrementally since the 1960s and it needs to stop</p>
<p t="551920" d="2630">so that's that's partly what [the]</p>
<p t="555399" d="5179">Conservatives, not only conservatives, but also liberals true liberals in the English sense are up against</p>
<p t="560670" d="3809">I mean what's happened that as also as a consequence of this postmodern?</p>
<p t="565059" d="5090">Neo-Marxist intellectual invasion is that the center keeps moving. It's moved way to the right now</p>
<p t="570149" d="6390">So if you're a classic liberal you've become a conservative and so for all of you who are interested in Purdue pursuing the conservative agenda</p>
<p t="576790" d="5389">There's a lot of classic liberals that you could be talking to and then finally with regards to talking to young people</p>
<p t="582179" d="2010">You finally have something to sell to them</p>
<p t="584189" d="3869">You know it's not easy to sell conservatism to young people because they want to change things</p>
<p t="588059" d="3330">And that's not what conservatives want to do they want to maintain things</p>
<p t="591610" d="6289">Well now you've got something to sell the young people you can sell them freedom of speech, and you can tell sell them</p>
<p t="598420" d="2509">Responsibility the left is selling them rights</p>
<p t="601209" d="1940">You can sell the responsibility</p>
<p t="603149" d="6479">And I can tell you because I received many letters of the sort that that God was talking about young people are absolutely starving</p>
<p t="609990" d="4889">For someone to provide them with the sense of responsibility [and] say look here's something worth living for man</p>
<p t="620160" d="2510">You know you can find meaning in life with freedom</p>
<p t="622670" d="5130">But freedom freedom is a chaotic sort of meaning right and freedom isn't the sort of thing that makes people happy</p>
<p t="627800" d="3149">it's the sort of thing [that] makes people trouble some trouble because</p>
<p t="632129" d="1531">freedom</p>
<p t="633660" d="5450">expands your your series of choices and that makes you nervous and uncertain so but</p>
<p t="639540" d="3589">Responsibility is another and not to say that that's a bad [thing]. It's a good thing</p>
<p t="643129" d="5220">But it requires that you that you shoulder the responsibility of the freedom</p>
<p t="648350" d="3029">But responsibility per se is what gives your life meaning?</p>
<p t="651959" d="2809">genuine meaning in the face of suffering and you and</p>
<p t="654870" d="6199">Young people is really [there] starving for that. I've been teaching young people for thirty years and mostly what I've been teaching them about is</p>
<p t="661800" d="3079">Responsibility, [it's] like your heirs to a great tradition</p>
<p t="664879" d="7410">It's not perfect [obviously] but comparatively. There's nothing else like it. That's ever been produced and it's it</p>
<p t="672839" d="2000">represents a tiny minority of</p>
<p t="675720" d="2000">human qualities most of which are</p>
<p t="678779" d="2750">run by Murderous antisocial psychopathic</p>
<p t="683639" d="2000">thugs and not that</p>
<p t="686040" d="5239">Seriously, and so what kind of alternative is that we've got this beacon of freedom and wealth in the west</p>
<p t="691279" d="6479">That works although. It doesn't work perfectly and one of the one [of] the responsibilities of young people is to find out</p>
<p t="697759" d="4050">what's at the [core] of that the great great core of that the</p>
<p t="701970" d="2419">Paramount the Paramount importance of the</p>
<p t="704459" d="6200">Individual and the divinity [of] speech man, not some to sell its what our whole culture is predicated on</p>
<p t="715280" d="3079">All right, well I should stop there. So thank you very much for the invitation</p>
