<p t="11549" d="1781">I</p>
<p t="13330" d="3350">Started that I started the beginning of the class</p>
<p t="18460" d="2239">three months ago talking to you about</p>
<p t="22329" d="4100">What it what the problem was that I was trying to address?</p>
<p t="27399" d="1621">and</p>
<p t="29020" d="3199">The fundamental problem was the problem of belief systems</p>
<p t="32860" d="2000">and</p>
<p t="34870" d="2000">the issue is was</p>
<p t="38800" d="2540">what precisely constitutes a belief system and</p>
<p t="43360" d="5930">Then a secondary question was why are people so inclined to</p>
<p t="50920" d="4160">even engage in conflict to Maintain and Expand their belief systems</p>
<p t="56800" d="5959">and then maybe a sub question of that and is there an alternative to conflict with regards to belief systems and</p>
<p t="63909" d="2000">then the last issue</p>
<p t="66820" d="4729">Was something like well. Is there a way of judging the relative quality of belief systems?</p>
<p t="72520" d="2779">And so those are all very very complicated questions, I</p>
<p t="76329" d="3559">mean the first one is something like</p>
<p t="81189" d="6650">How is it possible to understand the structures by which we orient ourselves in the world the second one is something like</p>
<p t="90189" d="2510">What's the pSychological significance?</p>
<p t="93609" d="3230">Precisely of those systems. What role does it play in?</p>
<p t="97569" d="2930">psychological health and maybe also in Social health</p>
<p t="101529" d="2000">the next one is</p>
<p t="105249" d="6529">can you make a [non] [relativistic] case when you assess an array of different value systems and</p>
<p t="113439" d="2540">then link to that is is it possible to</p>
<p t="117340" d="2989">hierarchically organized value systems in</p>
<p t="120849" d="5180">The manner that's justifiable, so that something can be reasonably considered in</p>
<p t="126549" d="2330">a superior or subordinate position</p>
<p t="130000" d="2000">now the last question</p>
<p t="133690" d="5299">Drew my attention because because of the implications of the first set and the last</p>
<p t="140290" d="2569">question drew my attention because I</p>
<p t="144280" d="5150">Was trying to sort out the metaphysics in some sense of the cold war?</p>
<p t="150700" d="4010">the question was was this just a battleground between</p>
<p t="156460" d="2360">two hypothetically equally</p>
<p t="160000" d="7250">appropriate belief systems which would could be a morally immoral relativistic perspective right it's belief systems are arbitrary and</p>
<p t="168070" d="6829">So combat between them is in some sense inevitable and even more to the point there isn't any other way</p>
<p t="175210" d="1890">around the</p>
<p t="177100" d="2089">discontinuity in some sense other than</p>
<p t="180250" d="1530">combat or</p>
<p t="181780" d="2000">subordination because there's no way of</p>
<p t="184360" d="1980">adjudicating a</p>
<p t="186340" d="5720">Victor because there's no such thing as victory if there's no way of ranking value systems. It's arbitrary</p>
<p t="192700" d="4850">As a frightening prospect because it means that if you have a value system, and I have a value system</p>
<p t="197550" d="1320">And they're different and they're different</p>
<p t="198870" d="4590">[I] mean we can talk or you can subordinate yourself, or I could do the same</p>
<p t="203590" d="3710">But there's also no [reason] why we shouldn't just engage in Flat-out</p>
<p t="208209" d="1891">Conflict</p>
<p t="210100" d="5600">now it's complicated in the modern world obviously by the fact that conflict can become so</p>
<p t="216640" d="5930">[untraveled] that it risks destroying everything and that doesn't seem necessarily to be in anyone's best interest unless</p>
<p t="223030" d="7250">Your interest haps happens to be in destroying everything and certainly there are no shortage of people whose interests tilt in that direction</p>
<p t="232930" d="5029">Alright, so the first question was well. What does it mean to have a belief [system] and</p>
<p t="239830" d="3020">That's a very complicated problem, and I think</p>
<p t="245620" d="3680">It's a subset of the question of being</p>
<p t="251830" d="2659">Maybe you can break the question of being into two</p>
<p t="255220" d="1680">domains</p>
<p t="256900" d="3260">Which we've done in this class, and you could say well, you can assess being</p>
<p t="261190" d="5209">From the perspective of what exists and then you can assess being from the perspective of how?</p>
<p t="266980" d="1470">You ought to act?</p>
<p t="268450" d="5599">so it's like you walk into a room and you can describe the furniture or</p>
<p t="274660" d="3170">You can determine how your going to conduct yourself in the room</p>
<p t="278380" d="4460">Maybe it's the difference between a play and the stage setting for a play now</p>
<p t="283960" d="2000">the Modernist</p>
<p t="286060" d="6109">Perspectives Roughly speaking is that the fundamental reality is to be found in the description of the furniture?</p>
<p t="292330" d="3739">So to speak in the description of what is that's the scientific?</p>
<p t="298840" d="1410">process</p>
<p t="300250" d="2449">[and] the scientific process seems to involve</p>
<p t="303790" d="2180">the stripping off of the subjective</p>
<p t="306730" d="3140">from perception and to some degree from action and</p>
<p t="310660" d="2389">the extraction of the commonalities across</p>
<p t="313870" d="2119">perception as a means of</p>
<p t="317500" d="2059">delineating the Nature of reality</p>
<p t="320200" d="2660">Now obviously that's a [very] powerful</p>
<p t="323500" d="4069">process, and it has many advantages, but exactly what it is that</p>
<p t="328150" d="4579">science is doing is not precisely clear one perspective might be is that</p>
<p t="333250" d="1320">we are</p>
<p t="334570" d="2000">genuinely</p>
<p t="338140" d="4100">Discovering the Nature of objective reality [and] perhaps even the nature of reality itself</p>
<p t="343000" d="1590">but</p>
<p t="344590" d="2000">There are some problems with that perspective</p>
<p t="347560" d="2000">one of them being that</p>
<p t="350740" d="7220">The scientific process seems to strip the subjective from the phenomena. It does that technically right?</p>
<p t="357960" d="4829">I mean you have [a] hypothesis about what something is and you have a hypothesis about what something is and you have [a]</p>
<p t="362980" d="5839">hypothesis [about] some [what] something is and we undertake a number of procedures to assess what the</p>
<p t="369250" d="5300">Fundamental phenomena is and then we look across our perceptual set and we extract out the commonalities</p>
<p t="374550" d="4799">And we dispense with everything that is superfluous everything that's merely subjective</p>
<p t="379420" d="6529">So what you feel about the chair is not relevant to the objective existence of the chair and so it</p>
<p t="386350" d="5899">eradicate subjectivity, and that's a very useful process because it does seem to enable us to</p>
<p t="393160" d="7909">Grasp reality in a fundamental sense more profoundly, but it leaves the subjective behind and maybe that's a problem</p>
<p t="403199" d="6259">Because it annoys okay, okay? Thank you. [what] [if] I just didn't alright appreciate it, so</p>
<p t="412469" d="6169">so then the issue might [be] well is something you retrieve ibly lost if you dispense with this objective and and</p>
<p t="419699" d="1890">also, how</p>
<p t="421589" d="3049">Deep a hole do you dig when you dispense with this objective?</p>
<p t="426719" d="1560">and</p>
<p t="428279" d="1740">I think that that's</p>
<p t="430019" d="1230">intrinsically</p>
<p t="431249" d="1560">associated with the</p>
<p t="432809" d="2570">Problem of the relationship between is [an] [dot]</p>
<p t="436019" d="1200">because</p>
<p t="437219" d="2000">That's an old</p>
<p t="439289" d="4130">Philosophical conundrum, I think first put forth by D. David hume</p>
<p t="444149" d="2000">Who made the claim that?</p>
<p t="446219" d="2989">No matter how much you know about something from an empirical perspective?</p>
<p t="449789" d="4699">You cannot use that as an unerring guide to action in relationship to that?</p>
<p t="455159" d="6709">To that empirical object or set of empirical objects and people it's a tricky [issue]. You know because obviously you can use empirical</p>
<p t="462599" d="2000">information to inform your decisions</p>
<p t="466619" d="2000">But I think</p>
<p t="468689" d="6319">But the problem is is that there's multiple pathways of action that are implied by any set of data that seems to be the fundamental</p>
<p t="475009" d="2940">Problem, it's something like that. Is that you can't draw a one-To-one</p>
<p t="478499" d="6889">Specification between the empirical district description and what you should do about that and like maybe an [example] is</p>
<p t="485999" d="2209">But you can gather a lot of information about aids</p>
<p t="488209" d="5100">and you can gather a lot of information about cancer and you can gather a lot of information about educational outcomes and</p>
<p t="493679" d="4309">Economic outcomes and so forth but it isn't obvious. How you then use that?</p>
<p t="498539" d="1680">empirical information</p>
<p t="500219" d="4369">For example how to guide policy decisions because you might say well, how much money should we spend on education?</p>
<p t="504899" d="6410">compared to cancer prevention and how much money should be spent on cancer prevention compared to curing aids and or</p>
<p t="512189" d="4489">Addressing disease in the third-world country what happens is that the set of variables that you?</p>
<p t="517019" d="6049">Encounter while trying to make your empirical calculation get to be so massive so rapidly that there doesn't seem to be any</p>
<p t="523349" d="5539">Logical way of linking them to a behavioral outcome now. It's kind of associated with the postmodern conundrum as well</p>
<p t="528889" d="4320">Which is well if you have a set of data, and it could be a literary work without better</p>
<p t="533339" d="4159">There's a very large number of interpretations that you can derive from [that] set of data</p>
<p t="537499" d="2970">And there's no simple way of deciding which one is going to be canonical</p>
<p t="540470" d="6539">and so it isn't it I think the reason that you can't derive a naught from an is is because you run into something like</p>
<p t="547319" d="4010">Combinatorial explosion it's like you have an infinite [number] of facts at your disposal</p>
<p t="551459" d="4669">Roughly speaking and then another infinite number of ways that you can organize those facts and that</p>
<p t="556829" d="2690">massive array of facts and and</p>
<p t="560939" d="4460">[Andrey] categorized facts doesn't tell you what to do in a given situation</p>
<p t="565559" d="6530">and so maybe the question of what to do in a given situation is a different domain of question and</p>
<p t="572970" d="7429">I believe that to be the [case]. I think it was Stephen Jay gould who talked about religion and science as</p>
<p t="581220" d="2000">- I think he called them different</p>
<p t="583350" d="6320">Magisterium to different fundamental domains that and that each had their realm of operation and one was the</p>
<p t="590040" d="7070">description of the objective world obviously that's on the scientific end and the other was the realm of ethics and so you could put</p>
<p t="597449" d="6679">Religion Mythology narrative the humanities all of that history even for that matter to some degree into the into the</p>
<p t="605069" d="1560">ethics</p>
<p t="606629" d="2000">Category and</p>
<p t="608639" d="2000">because I don't see a</p>
<p t="610920" d="1859">[straightforward] way of</p>
<p t="612779" d="5210">Taking a set of facts and then transforming them into a behavioral compulsion</p>
<p t="618720" d="5270">then I do think that these two [things] are reasonably regarded as overlapping and</p>
<p t="624660" d="1320">intrinsically</p>
<p t="625980" d="2000">associated but</p>
<p t="628079" d="2450">But technically and philosophically</p>
<p t="631470" d="2000">separable</p>
<p t="633540" d="5630">[alright], so then then the next question emerges well if they're separable if there has to be a</p>
<p t="640319" d="2600">domain of inquiry into the structure of [values]</p>
<p t="645029" d="2000">What might that look like?</p>
<p t="647910" d="3169">like how is it that you would understand the</p>
<p t="653279" d="2000">psychological and sociological</p>
<p t="657509" d="2989">phenomena that are associated with a Moral stance</p>
<p t="664539" d="5869">[Howhow] would you understand the details of that and then even more to the point is there any way of</p>
<p t="671349" d="4369">subjecting different sets of ethical interpretation to</p>
<p t="676269" d="4639">Testing so that you can judge their comparative validity because that's sort of the way out of Moral relativism</p>
<p t="681759" d="2000">Roughly speaking. It's like</p>
<p t="685359" d="5000">First you make the proposition that there are value structures and that they're independent from empirical investigation</p>
<p t="690359" d="7080">and then the next is that you investigate the possibility that you can compare and contrast different structures of ethics and</p>
<p t="698019" d="2989">Draw some sort of conclusion. That's not merely arbitrary</p>
<p t="701829" d="3859">Now it might be turtles all the way down. That's how the old joke goes right, but</p>
<p t="705999" d="5359">But maybe not then I was interested in that again because I thought well are we fighting the cold war</p>
<p t="713679" d="2270">merely because we're having an argument or</p>
<p t="718269" d="1230">is</p>
<p t="719499" d="1800">there some</p>
<p t="721299" d="5330">Manner in which one of these systems can be just determined to be wrong and of course</p>
<p t="727959" d="2419">There was more weight behind that query</p>
<p t="731139" d="1680">because</p>
<p t="732819" d="5690">The soviet system and the maoist system and and the system. That's in place in North Korea</p>
<p t="739149" d="1440">were not only</p>
<p t="740589" d="6739">Predicated on different assumptions than in the western system, but they were also extraordinarily murderous and so that seemed to add additional</p>
<p t="748269" d="2449">Weight [to] the to the sequence of questions</p>
<p t="753069" d="2000">so</p>
<p t="757770" d="4679">I was reading young at the time and young was carl young was</p>
<p t="763000" d="3859">fundamentally I would say a psychologist of narrative of story and</p>
<p t="767380" d="1380">and</p>
<p t="768760" d="2029">He he outlined this</p>
<p t="771820" d="2539">He outlined the idea for me that</p>
<p t="775120" d="2479">people inhabited Stories Roughly speaking</p>
<p t="777600" d="4380">He said actually they inhabited myths and even more to the point whether they knew it or not</p>
<p t="782200" d="4069">They inhabited archetypal myths or even that they were possessed by them</p>
<p t="786270" d="5640">And so it was the first time I'd really come into contact with the idea directly put that</p>
<p t="792820" d="2059">there was a direct relationship between the</p>
<p t="795640" d="3379">structures that you use to orient yourself in the world and</p>
<p t="799810" d="2659">stories, and so then I started to</p>
<p t="803110" d="1110">assess</p>
<p t="804220" d="3679">the fundamental elements of stories what what - story looked like and</p>
<p t="808240" d="4429">while I was doing that that was informed by a number of other things that I was reading about including a</p>
<p t="814210" d="2000">set of I</p>
<p t="816400" d="5510">Read the Neuroscience literature with regards to information processing fairly extensively</p>
<p t="823300" d="5989">And that introduced me [into] a whole set of other ideas including cybernetic ideas which have been incorporated into what I was</p>
<p t="829570" d="2630">describing to you, and this basic cybernetic system is a</p>
<p t="832990" d="3169">system [that] has [a] starting point in a system that [has] an [endpoint] and</p>
<p t="836680" d="5450">A system that has a subsystem that monitors progress or deviation from progress</p>
<p t="842590" d="3380">Along the pathway to the endpoint, and I thought well [that] looks a lot like a story</p>
<p t="846490" d="3380">Or a map that's another way of thinking about it, and I thought okay</p>
<p t="849870" d="4919">Well that's where the overlap is and the fundamental story is something like it's very [straightforward]. It's</p>
<p t="855730" d="4250">it's also the frame that you inhabit when you conceptualize the world and narrow and</p>
<p t="860350" d="5119">Narrow and simplify the world which you have to do because it's so complex because you have this infinite number of facts that</p>
<p t="865600" d="7910">Are laying around you well so what are you doing? Well? You're a mobile creature a living creature not a static information processor and</p>
<p t="874330" d="3949">You're targeted you're a targeted creature, and otherwise you wouldn't move</p>
<p t="878920" d="5750">Right to move is to be a targeted creature because you have to move towards something or away from something so the targeting is built</p>
<p t="884670" d="2729">Right into the fact that you're a mobile creature, and then you might say well</p>
<p t="887400" d="3239">What do you target [and] answer to that is well, you target?</p>
<p t="891209" d="2849">Target you could say you target what you aim for but?</p>
<p t="894309" d="4670">Then you could say well you you aim for what you want you target your desires</p>
<p t="898980" d="7139">And then that leads you into a discussion of the underlying neurobiology essentially you bring to the table a set of inbuilt</p>
<p t="906699" d="2000">desires and</p>
<p t="909790" d="2000">the targets that you pick</p>
<p t="911829" d="5660">Have to address the fact that those desires exist and the desires are actually grounded in Necessity</p>
<p t="917490" d="6029">and this is this is a sidebar, but this is where I think piaget theory is weaker than it should be because</p>
<p t="924189" d="4220">piaget and you know I'm a great admirer of piaget believed that the</p>
<p t="929050" d="6469">Human infant came into the world with a fairly primordial set of reflexes mostly sensory motor reflexes and then bootstrapped</p>
<p t="935619" d="5480">Him or herself up on the basis of those reflexes in the sociological in</p>
<p t="941860" d="2000">the Social Surroundings</p>
<p t="944649" d="4039">Viewpoint [that] the child comes in with a few basic elements that can get it going</p>
<p t="949149" d="3830">elements of exploration and memory essentially and then it builds itself</p>
<p t="953259" d="5570">Of the consequence of its exploration in the social community now. I think that's true except that</p>
<p t="959920" d="2959">It's too empty because what it fails to</p>
<p t="964600" d="2599">take into [consideration] is the fact that and</p>
<p t="967839" d="7010">I think this is this is an observation in some sense philosophically that was first made by immanuel, Kant when he criticized pure reason</p>
<p t="975220" d="1619">so that</p>
<p t="976839" d="4609">You can't come into the world structureless you have to come into the world with an inbuilt structure</p>
<p t="981449" d="2280">And then it's the interaction of [that] structure with the world</p>
<p t="984339" d="5599">That provides the information that you can use to build yourself, but the structure has to be there</p>
<p t="989939" d="5460">And I would say that's the sameness logically speaking as the idea that the [great] [father] is always there, right?</p>
<p t="995399" d="4289">There's the great mother is always there. That's Chaos itself the great father is always there that's order</p>
<p t="999689" d="6030">That's the interpretive structure that you use to interact with the Chaos and then of course the individual is always there at the same time</p>
<p t="1005720" d="2609">that piaget in some sense ree-ree</p>
<p t="1009480" d="1680">told that story</p>
<p t="1011160" d="1229">except</p>
<p t="1012389" d="1831">He didn't</p>
<p t="1014220" d="6169">give enough credence to the fact that the infant comes into the world far [more] fully formed than</p>

<p t="1084880" d="2000">To play a joint game with you</p>
<p t="1087250" d="3409">But the Joint game has constraints and one of them is you have to want to play?</p>
<p t="1091090" d="2989">Because you have other options [and] then there are other constraints</p>
<p t="1095710" d="4819">You and I have to be able to play in a way that other people don't object to or maybe even that you and I</p>
<p t="1100529" d="1961">Have to play in a way that other people</p>

<p t="1112809" d="5390">So it has it has to work today and tomorrow and next week it has to work across the span [of] times it has [to]</p>
<p t="1118200" d="839">Work not only for you</p>

<p t="1123240" d="3539">That's just on the socio-Cultural side that's on the constructionist side only</p>
<p t="1127389" d="6290">But there's about the biological constraints are equally important because not only does the [game] that you and I have to play</p>
<p t="1133960" d="1829">Have to satisfy those</p>

<p t="1137020" d="6439">sociological constraints, but the game also has to be organized so that the internal polity that</p>

<p t="1151630" d="6440">Constitute us. They have to all find satisfaction because otherwise the system grounds halt [and] so</p>
<p t="1158590" d="5720">This seems to me to be the beginnings of an answer to the postmodern conundrum looks like okay?</p>

<p t="1169660" d="7250">That makes deriving and is from an [Oauth2] very difficult endeavor right no problem. [all] right, but that</p>
<p t="1177430" d="2000">Doesn't mean that any old solution will work</p>
<p t="1180370" d="4640">why well first of all it's merely because we introduced work into the</p>
<p t="1185620" d="4969">Conversation to begin with the interpretation has to be functional and again. That's what it seems</p>
<p t="1190660" d="3079">That's what seems to tie. It back to the story. This is also</p>
<p t="1193740" d="5040">what got me interested in pragmatism, technically speaking and so because if if</p>
<p t="1199450" d="3770">your conundrum is here you are and there you have to be and</p>
<p t="1203560" d="5029">How to get there then one of the constraints on the Manner in which you interpret the world is</p>
<p t="1209650" d="1970">When you apply your interpretation</p>
<p t="1211620" d="4109">Do you end up moving from the point you're at to the point you want to be and if the answer that is no?</p>
<p t="1216100" d="5660">Then the solution is insufficient now. You could call the solution untrue, but I it's dangerous, too</p>
<p t="1222310" d="2000">to introduce the truth</p>
<p t="1224860" d="6589">Falsity Dilemma because because it isn't its functionality more its functionality more than truth although</p>
<p t="1231450" d="2460">I think you could say that in the final analysis truth</p>
<p t="1233910" d="1530">Is integrally linked to function?</p>
<p t="1235440" d="3659">But I'm not going to touch that question for the time being the point is is that</p>
<p t="1239560" d="6229">your interpretation of the world carries within it implicitly a theory about its own validity and the</p>
<p t="1246190" d="4549">Theory about its own validity is that if you enacted in the world it will produce the result that you</p>
<p t="1251200" d="6350">Desire and then the consequence of that is [that] if it doesn't produce the result that you desire then it isn't good enough theory</p>
<p t="1257770" d="2929">period and that's how you grapple with</p>
<p t="1262000" d="5989">The fact that although you don't know everything you still have to orient yourself in the world</p>
<p t="1268720" d="6140">You lay out partial theories that make partial predictions, and if they do a good enough job</p>
<p t="1274930" d="3260">Then you don't worry about it [any] more and you go on to the next thing, okay?</p>
<p t="1278190" d="4079">So then you think there's a lot of constraints piling up on your interpretations number one</p>
<p t="1282850" d="5540">They have to work for [the] creature that you are and so you know we can lay it sort of like maslow's hierarchy of needs</p>
<p t="1288550" d="6949">something like that's not exactly the same because I don't [think] [that] he got the hierarchy right for for very complex reasons, but it's it's</p>
<p t="1296080" d="2000">reasonably obvious to to</p>
<p t="1298180" d="4099">Observe that well you're not going to work out very well if you don't have anything to eat</p>
<p t="1302280" d="5010">And you know you've got about a week in you if you don't have anything to drink and obviously you need shelter</p>
<p t="1307290" d="5909">And you know you need you need companionship and by need what I mean is that if you don't have these things then you die</p>
<p t="1313200" d="3300">The whole game comes to a halt [so] we can ground that in?</p>
<p t="1317320" d="7609">Self-evident reality without any real problem, and you might say well, what's the list of human necessities and that that's that's a difficult thing to</p>
<p t="1325510" d="1140">parameterize</p>
<p t="1326650" d="5959">Because you can argue about the degree to which something is necessary, but there's some things that we know about</p>
<p t="1333490" d="2000">Well, we covered the basics</p>
<p t="1335679" d="7160">Temperature regulation elimination food intake shelter right, but then there's more subtle things like well</p>
<p t="1344559" d="2000">children for example died without touch</p>
<p t="1347080" d="2119">So there's there's something integral about</p>
<p t="1350230" d="4880">Tactile interaction with other people so we could call that love if you want to do that. It's not optional</p>
<p t="1355660" d="2000">Right play is the same thing</p>
<p t="1358960" d="2000">children do not develop properly</p>
<p t="1361570" d="1739">unless they play and</p>
<p t="1363309" d="5600">I would say that adults also can't maintain their mental health or physical health unless they play, [too]</p>
<p t="1368910" d="6419">And so you can say well, there's a core set of necessities, and then off of that. There's a secondary set of like</p>
<p t="1376690" d="2510">What would you call them their own ultimate necessities?</p>
<p t="1379200" d="6960">But they're pretty hot they're going to be pretty highly valued by people and more or less universally pain avoidance for example under most circumstances</p>

<p t="1393750" d="1590">You can lay out the basic motivations</p>
<p t="1395340" d="4050">And you can say well the [game] that you're going to play has to operate within a space</p>
<p t="1399390" d="5939">That's defined by that set of a priori constraints fine now things are getting [pretty] constrained here</p>
<p t="1405330" d="4140">so they had the game you play house to satisfy that set of</p>
<p t="1410710" d="2000">biological demands</p>
<p t="1413080" d="5989">Intrinsic biological demands and it has to be something that you can utilize with other people</p>
<p t="1420160" d="6199">Voluntarily and it has to be something that will [be] playable across multiple iterations, and I would say</p>
<p t="1427120" d="2000">there's a very limited number of</p>
<p t="1430120" d="7010">Interpretive interpretive structures that are going to satisfy all of those preconditions simultaneously, and to me that just blows out</p>
<p t="1437860" d="6079">The two things it blows out the claims of Moral relativism, and it it it also</p>
<p t="1444520" d="5359">Demolishes and this is the same thing in some sense it demolishes this ideas that the manner in which people</p>
<p t="1450070" d="3830">Organize themselves in the world as individuals and in societies is somehow</p>
<p t="1454480" d="1050">arbitrary</p>
<p t="1455530" d="2299">doesn't look to me to be arbitrary at all and</p>
<p t="1458530" d="6799">So in ampere days genius. I think in some part was observing that in children spontaneously in that when children</p>
<p t="1466480" d="5930">passed the egocentric phase which means after they're about two years of old old, [they're] maybe [they're]</p>
<p t="1473740" d="7369">What they're approaching three years old they've more or less got their internal mechanisms organized so that there are</p>

<p t="1483309" d="2000">Roughly speaking at</p>
<p t="1485320" d="4700">Three they start to develop the ability to use fictional frames of reference</p>
<p t="1490480" d="4040">So and that's an interesting thing because I would say that the fundamental</p>
<p t="1494950" d="4910">biological systems come armed with their own frame of reference, so [if] you're hungry</p>
<p t="1500500" d="3500">Poof up comes [a] frame of reference [and] within that</p>
<p t="1505480" d="4729">Your perceptions are shaped the action proclivities are are</p>
<p t="1511540" d="1620">primed and</p>
<p t="1513160" d="2149">The world lays itself out around that particular</p>

<p t="1520049" d="3119">Hot same if you want to play all those systems come</p>
<p t="1523929" d="3440">built in but then the problem with that is that</p>
<p t="1527679" d="4070">they compete because it isn't obvious which one should take priority and then</p>
<p t="1531910" d="2419">It's not that easy to organize them in a social space</p>
<p t="1534330" d="3420">[and] so what seems to have happened to human beings is that we've been able to replace</p>
<p t="1538270" d="2000">the frame that's</p>

<p t="1551530" d="1460">And that's in some [sense]</p>
<p t="1552990" d="3239">That's also what it's the same thing as we learned how to think abstractly</p>
<p t="1556480" d="1730">and so the frame</p>
<p t="1558210" d="3719">that you're going to lay out on the world if it's a good frame is one that solves a whole set of problems at the</p>
<p t="1561930" d="1210">same time and</p>
<p t="1563140" d="1380">so that</p>
<p t="1564520" d="5629">[and] you can slot different frames you can you can experiment with [different] frames?</p>
<p t="1570150" d="670">and that's a</p>
<p t="1570820" d="5750">Precondition to being able to play because one of the things that piaget pointed out you can see this when children pretend play. It's like</p>
<p t="1577720" d="6290">Four and even more clearly in games that have rules, but let's say they're there in pretend play, and they're going to say well</p>
<p t="1584010" d="2159">We're going to lay out a little fictional schema here</p>
<p t="1586170" d="690">We're going to play house</p>
<p t="1586860" d="5640">And you can be the cat and all be the I'll be the dad and then you negotiate a bit to see if those rules</p>
<p t="1592500" d="6359">Are acceptable and then you run it as a simulation, and that's what kids are doing when they're playing and they're experimenting with different</p>
<p t="1599530" d="4640">Superordinate frames of reference that are active all in the world, and they're in there</p>
<p t="1604170" d="3270">they're [learning] how to develop those perceptual schemes and also how to</p>
<p t="1607840" d="7369">Interact in a manner that allows the scheme that they're using to find its social acceptability and its successful</p>
<p t="1616000" d="1770">the child</p>
<p t="1617770" d="1680">assumes that</p>
<p t="1619450" d="2180">the Scheme is successful if</p>
<p t="1622180" d="2450">both children have fun while they're doing it and</p>
<p t="1624940" d="6440">So that's the volunteerism and so piaget made a very interesting point about that that I think is [absolutely] brilliant. He said that</p>
<p t="1633220" d="3170">there's a difference between a game that people will play voluntarily and</p>
<p t="1636940" d="3950">One that has to be enforced and so then you can imagine an environment</p>
<p t="1640890" d="4049">Where game a is played voluntarily it has a certain end and game b</p>
<p t="1644940" d="4349">is played by Force but both of them are moving towards the same end and</p>
<p t="1649840" d="7130">Piaget his claim was the game that's played voluntarily or even more to the point the set of all games that are played</p>
<p t="1657400" d="6230">Voluntarily will out-Compete the set of all games that are played by Force if they're put head-to-head in a competitive environment</p>
<p t="1664020" d="7350">[I] thought God that's such a brilliant observation because there you have the basis for a pragmatic grounding of</p>
<p t="1672100" d="2119">For the evaluation of ethics. It's like</p>
<p t="1675340" d="2809">You can pick the Target. It doesn't matter whatever Target</p>
<p t="1678150" d="6780">You pick if the game is voluntary and aimed at the target it will defeat a game. That's imposed by Tyranny now</p>
<p t="1684930" d="2250">It's a proposition, but it's a pretty good proposition</p>
<p t="1687180" d="4660">and I would say there's a fair bit of evidence for this proposition and a fair bit of it is actually derived from</p>
<p t="1692630" d="7280">observation of animal Behavior because I ran you guys through the emerging literature on the stability say of Chimpanzee hierarchies and the</p>
<p t="1700550" d="1500">Chimpanzee tyrant</p>
<p t="1702050" d="5450">Hierarchy isn't very stable and the reason for that is that to subordinate chimps who are?</p>
<p t="1707630" d="6319">3/4 as strong as the dominant tyrant can take them out and they do and so then the question might be well</p>
<p t="1713950" d="6359">How do you have to conduct yourself as a high dominance chimp if you're not going to be torn apart by those who are?</p>
<p t="1720560" d="4640">Hypothetically your subordinates and the answer to that is well. Don't be too much of a</p>
<p t="1725900" d="2000">Tyrant</p>
<p t="1728240" d="2479">formulate some social connections engage in some</p>
<p t="1731390" d="2299">reciprocity with regards to your social relationships</p>
<p t="1734420" d="3650">Don't oppress the females don't torment the children</p>
<p t="1738190" d="2430">It said ETC because that makes you unpopular</p>
<p t="1740620" d="3209">And then you'll get torn to shreds and so there are</p>
<p t="1744170" d="7310">practical limits on the expression of Tyranny that are a consequence both of biological limitations because people are going to</p>
<p t="1751670" d="6470">object if the system is set up so [that] their fundamental needs are met and they're also going to object if</p>
<p t="1758690" d="6050">The game that's being played isn't functioning socially and so this is very very tight set of constraints</p>
<p t="1764960" d="3140">And then the question might be okay if you take that set of constraints</p>
<p t="1768740" d="2179">What sort of systems can operate?</p>
<p t="1772250" d="2000">What would you say well?</p>
<p t="1774290" d="3710">Just that what set of systems can operate within those sets of constraints?</p>
<p t="1778460" d="5390">Then you might say if you take that the set of all systems that might operate within those constraints</p>
<p t="1783850" d="6030">And you look at what's common across them then you could extract out what's essentially a universal morality</p>
<p t="1790340" d="2270">It's something like that and I</p>
<p t="1793130" d="6829">Don't see how that proposition is precisely questionable. It seems to me [that] all of that's built on rock like there's no [doubt] that</p>
<p t="1801320" d="5450">Infants bring biological necessity to the table. I think that's fully established and it's established</p>
<p t="1807770" d="2000">Physiologically, it's established</p>
<p t="1810290" d="2000">behaviorally</p>
<p t="1812330" d="4130">it's established with regards to evolutionary history because we can take the</p>
<p t="1816680" d="6680">Motivational systems that are part and parcel of our being and we can trace their development back in some cases half a billion years</p>
<p t="1824030" d="1370">so</p>
<p t="1825400" d="6479">So the idea that the the infant is a blank slate when it's born and that's subject to infinite</p>
<p t="1832700" d="4940">Sociological manipulation is a it's a dead in the water. That's just not the case</p>
<p t="1838280" d="2900">So okay, so far. So we've got that nailed down</p>
<p t="1842180" d="2599">hard and then the idea that</p>
<p t="1845750" d="2329">Your identity is also shaped</p>
<p t="1848750" d="5119">Sociologically well I don't think anybody disputes that it doesn't matter where they are on the interpretative framework they might</p>
<p t="1853970" d="4910">dispute the degree to which [that] occurs and the mechanisms by which it occurs, but</p>
<p t="1859670" d="2239">The fact that it occurs. That's</p>
<p t="1862670" d="2809">That's close enough to self evidence so we can just leave it there</p>
<p t="1866690" d="3290">well then the question is what are the consequences of the</p>
<p t="1871010" d="2000">sociological of</p>
<p t="1873470" d="2000">socio of socialization and</p>
<p t="1878510" d="2000">Once you admit the nifty</p>
<p t="1881030" d="4640">existence of the realm of biological necessity you instantly put a set of constraints on</p>

<p t="1891470" d="2000">torn down and overthrown</p>
<p t="1895100" d="6650">Well that if you look at. How kids are socialized. I think that psAys developmental observations are Bi and Bi correct</p>
<p t="1903260" d="4160">The first two years it's mostly interactions between the infant and the parents</p>
<p t="1908360" d="2000">It's it's bi-directional though</p>
<p t="1910670" d="4759">Because the infant has to come to terms with the mother but the mother also has to come to terms with the infant</p>
<p t="1915429" d="3630">So it's not even top-down at the level of infant maternal relationship</p>
<p t="1919340" d="3920">Quite the contrary and if you watch a new mother adapt to a baby</p>
<p t="1923630" d="4880">you can see that the mother is doing as much out apt ation to the baby as the baby is to the mother because the</p>
<p t="1928670" d="3769">Infant has this inbuilt character already and has to be</p>
<p t="1933350" d="4969">Charmed into a relationship that's love does that and and attention</p>
<p t="1938320" d="6210">it's very little different than establishing a relationship with someone who's older it's it's lower resolution and</p>
<p t="1945320" d="4460">It's harder to make the observations because of course the infant is only capable of behavioral display</p>
<p t="1949780" d="5459">[can't] can't speak but nonetheless the necessity for establishing the individual relationship</p>
<p t="1955240" d="5579">Is there to begin with so even in the early stages of the infant's realization the process isn't?</p>
<p t="1961370" d="3140">State downward it's not great farther down work. It's</p>
<p t="1965179" d="5869">Mutual and then of Course by the time the child is old enough to be launched out into [the] social world</p>
<p t="1971299" d="7310">Then all the constraints that are associated with the playground are immediately placed on that child and that's a very unforgiving landscape</p>
<p t="1978610" d="5939">right because the last thing a child wants really the last thing a child wants is not to have any friends or</p>
<p t="1985190" d="3950">even perhaps equally seriously not to have a best friend [I]</p>
<p t="1989779" d="4790">Read something so idiotic the other day that I couldn't believe it. So the newest prince</p>
<p t="1995390" d="6409">So [queen] [Elizabeth's] I guess great grandchild is off to daycare in in the uk and in this daycare</p>
<p t="2001899" d="4790">They don't let the kids have best friends because that's unfair [I] thought you know</p>
<p t="2008890" d="3469">Something times you see something that's so stupid. You can't even believe it it</p>
<p t="2012909" d="7489">Exists, and that was one of those examples because it's been known for quite a long time that one of the developmental Milestones</p>
<p t="2020620" d="6469">the children attained somewhere between say the age of five and ten is they pick a best friend and</p>
<p t="2027250" d="4939">So they and and you know the hypothesis well that's unfair to all the other children</p>
<p t="2032190" d="4140">It's like well first of all you can't be the best friend to everyone because you didn't</p>
<p t="2036610" d="3109">Maybe there's a billion children so each of them gets one second</p>
<p t="2039720" d="5579">It's like that's just not a very deep relationship. So the idea that you can be equally friendly with everyone is</p>
<p t="2046299" d="5480">It's a preposterous, but even worse the thing is the thing [that] the child is doing is actually becoming</p>
<p t="2052480" d="6739">there they're stepping out of their egocentricity because their best friend becomes more important than they are and that's a precursor for</p>
<p t="2059589" d="2270">Adult relationships where you know if you're married?</p>
<p t="2062109" d="5090">[well] your your partner should be at least as important as you are and the relationship should be more important</p>
<p t="2067200" d="3510">But then when you have children, it's like they're more important than you [that] that's that</p>
<p t="2070710" d="5790">It's unless there's something wrong with you. You come second and your children come first and their way first</p>
<p t="2076500" d="3989">They're not just a little buddy. You're necessary because without you. They're not going to manage</p>
<p t="2080490" d="1139">So you have to take care of yourself?</p>
<p t="2081629" d="2520">But you're not number one [anymore] once you have kids unless</p>
<p t="2084639" d="6949">Seriously unless you didn't learn the lessons in the playground and when you have a best friend. You're not number one. They are and so</p>
<p t="2092900" d="3679">So anyways there are these constraints that Emerge in in the social landscape</p>
<p t="2097100" d="7219">you have to have friends and also you have to single someone out as particularly unique among those friends and establish a</p>
<p t="2104780" d="5810">Genuinely reciprocal and caring relationship. I can't remember the psychiatrist who studied this so intently</p>
<p t="2112400" d="2000">unfortunately</p>
<p t="2114560" d="5570">He was the first person [to] to do a detailed analysis of the best friend relationships that children</p>
<p t="2120530" d="6229">established and I'd like to give him credit for his ideas, but unfortunately I can't remember his name, so</p>
<p t="2129680" d="3560">Okay, so what are the propositions so far?</p>
<p t="2135890" d="6110">You inhabit a structure the [dorian] [Cu] in the world it has something. That's akin to a narrative structure. [I'm] here</p>
<p t="2142000" d="3089">[I'm] going there, and this is the [way] I did it its narrative if you describe it</p>
<p t="2146150" d="3949">It's based in biological necessity, but it's shaped by Social</p>
<p t="2150710" d="2119">socialization and the fact of that</p>
<p t="2153320" d="7429">Base and that shaping means that the set of interpretive schema that you can lay out in the world are bounded</p>
<p t="2161840" d="1620">Those would be functional</p>
<p t="2163460" d="5599">Hypothetically functional systems and maybe they compete over over the evolutionary time span</p>
<p t="2169430" d="6800">but there's something in common across that set of functional interpretations, and if you extract that out you can get the</p>
<p t="2177110" d="6860">Initial images of what you might describe as an archetype you never cilmi. That's what archetypes are</p>
<p t="2185000" d="1200">fundamentally</p>
<p t="2186200" d="6979">So and to say all that is no more than to say that people can extract across instances, and we can obviously do that</p>
<p t="2193430" d="5689">So then the question is can you start to develop an articulated picture of what that?</p>
<p t="2200180" d="2000">archetyPal</p>
<p t="2203000" d="2510">structure of universal morality might be and</p>
<p t="2206030" d="6680">so my answer [to] that was basically well let's look at old stories as many old stories as we can collect and</p>
<p t="2213050" d="4610">If their stories are stories that have survived for a very long period of time so much the better because it</p>
<p t="2218330" d="1380">[that]</p>
<p t="2219710" d="4069">indicates that they're acutely memorable and</p>
<p t="2224930" d="3289">Peculiarly functional because if they weren't memorable then they'd have been forgotten</p>
<p t="2228220" d="5370">and if they weren't functional they wouldn't have managed to be the foundation stories for four</p>
<p t="2234020" d="3139">Cultures that lasted for thousands or even tens of thousands of years</p>
<p t="2237770" d="1640">So and then we could say well</p>
<p t="2239410" d="4680">Let's collect a whole variety of these stories and see if there's patterns across them now the danger that is</p>
<p t="2246860" d="6199">Have you collected an unbiased set of stories danger number one how do you know that you're not just reading into the stories?</p>
<p t="2253210" d="1750">That's the postmodern problem</p>
<p t="2254960" d="3650">Reasonable reasonable objections and so that those objections have been laid</p>
<p t="2259310" d="2000">against people like</p>
<p t="2262820" d="3530">Wrote the Golden bough fraser who is the fraser who was one of the first?</p>
<p t="2266840" d="4550">Anthropologists to collect stories from all over the world and to start to look for commonalities the same</p>
<p t="2271790" d="5119">Objection has been laid at the feet of people like [Richie]. Le odd or carl jung or Joseph Campbell</p>
<p t="2276910" d="1480">it's like how do you know you just</p>
<p t="2278390" d="4789">How do you know you're not just cherry-picking your damn interpretations perfectly reasonable?</p>
<p t="2283910" d="4340">Perfectly reasonable objection, and I would say that the reason I [don't] believe that</p>
<p t="2288250" d="3810">I'm cherry-picking my interpretations is because I used a method and</p>
<p t="2292760" d="3830">it's a method that's akin to the Multi Trait Multi method method of</p>
<p t="2297260" d="5120">[construction] that that clinical psychology and other disciplines of psychology rely upon</p>
<p t="2302600" d="6739">But it's also akin to a process put forward by  E.O Wilson that he called consilience the process is something like</p>
<p t="2309740" d="2300">Well pick your level of analysis</p>
<p t="2312770" d="3439">Does the phenomena manifest itself at that level of analysis? Yes?</p>
<p t="2316420" d="5700">Pick another level of analysis and another level of analysis and another level of analysis and see if the same phenomena</p>
<p t="2322280" d="6379">Manifests itself at every single level and then assume that the probability that that will happen by chance</p>
<p t="2329330" d="7399">Decreases with each additional level of analysis [that] fits that where this concordance, and I thought okay that that that makes sense</p>
<p t="2336730" d="5010">So it isn't only that you can look for patterns and stories because you know what if you're a hyperactive?</p>
<p t="2341870" d="890">Pattern detector</p>
<p t="2342760" d="3780">Which basically means like there are people like that people who tilt towards Paranoia?</p>
<p t="2346670" d="4910">People who tilt towards conspiracy theories you can see it manifest itself in new age thinking all the time</p>
<p t="2352130" d="2299">Because new age thinkers are very high in openness</p>
<p t="2354430" d="3750">But not very good at critical thinking and so they see phenomena a and B and C and D</p>
<p t="2358180" d="4400">they think [Pad] then they think universal pattern but they don't attempt to</p>
<p t="2363910" d="6379">Disconfirm their pattern prediction and so what I tried to do when I was starting to see Patterns Emerge in the stories</p>
<p t="2370690" d="4640">Informed by people like dealing in a leotta and so forth was to see if what [they] were describing</p>
<p t="2375670" d="7640">Manifested itself at any other levels of analysis that [were] independent intellectually from that stream of thinking and I found it in two places</p>
<p t="2384010" d="4669">targeted cybernetics, and I found it in neuroscience and so</p>
<p t="2389620" d="4520">On and that that and the neuroscience element that includes the physiology</p>
<p t="2394140" d="7169">But also the behavioral analysis that was done by by people most particularly like like like Jeffrey Gray and and the animal</p>
<p t="2401590" d="5030">Experimental is who were brilliant Brilliant scientists, and who've done a very good job of laying out the manner in which</p>
<p t="2408220" d="2000">interpretive frameworks exist</p>
<p t="2411190" d="6979">Within the realm of animal cognition and and and to describe how they manifest themselves in the world, so [I] thought okay</p>
<p t="2418170" d="5280">That's not too bad because we've got maybe four different levels of evidence all pointing in the same Direction</p>
<p t="2423790" d="5929">So that's why I walk you guys through the neural psychology. It's like a story is you're going somewhere</p>
<p t="2429720" d="4110">You're somewhere, and you're going somewhere, and you're tracking your progress, [okay]?</p>
<p t="2433830" d="6119">That's the story well what what happens when you look at how people lay out their called cognitive maps well</p>
<p t="2439950" d="4739">It's the same thing you specify a target an endpoint. You specify a beginning point</p>
<p t="2444690" d="6570">Which is just where you are and then there's a mechanism a comparator mechanism that [operates] or multiple comparator mechanisms that operate?</p>
<p t="2451780" d="1530">Neural</p>
<p t="2453310" d="2719">Physiologically to orient yourself towards that goal and [the] emotions</p>
<p t="2456580" d="6349">Basically Emerge as a as a consequence of [that] positive emotions indicating that you're moving forward properly</p>
<p t="2463360" d="5869">Negative emotions indicating that you've encountered some kind of obstacle. It's like well. That's the basic. That's the basic</p>
<p t="2470050" d="1700">structure of a narrative, okay fine</p>
<p t="2471750" d="6239">So now we can see how its instantiated neural physiologically that adds a fair bit [of] credence to the to the entire</p>
<p t="2478540" d="1380">process</p>
<p t="2479920" d="2000">so</p>
<p t="2487790" d="2000">now normally when you look at the</p>
<p t="2491060" d="6949">Basic cybernetic work there's a hypothesis that the system is oriented towards a goal</p>
<p t="2499460" d="6979">And that it's comparing what is manifesting itself in the world to that desired end state as the system moves?</p>
<p t="2506450" d="2000">but it's too simple because</p>
<p t="2508849" d="2000">People don't precisely have gold</p>
<p t="2511339" d="2720">they have nested hierarchies of goals and</p>
<p t="2514819" d="2000">so</p>
<p t="2519319" d="7820">The issue of emotional regulation becomes more complex than are you proceeding happily towards your current goal</p>
<p t="2527540" d="4039">because your goal is composed of micro goals and it's a</p>
<p t="2532790" d="5270">Constituent element of a set of Macro goals and so that makes the problem of error Far more</p>
<p t="2538609" d="2989">Complex than it would be if you only had one frame of [reference]</p>
<p t="2541700" d="5000">[and] you were only adjudicating your error within that frame of reference the question starts to become</p>
<p t="2550160" d="2510">what does it mean when you make a mistake and</p>
<p t="2553670" d="1230">Answer to that</p>
<p t="2554900" d="3140">The Behavioral answer to that was well you encounter a stimuli</p>
<p t="2558230" d="5719">That's a threat or maybe a punishment or an incentive reward or a consumer [tori] reward something like that</p>
<p t="2564020" d="6679">It's very it's a it's a unit dimensional and oversimplified answer. I'm not complaining about it</p>
<p t="2570700" d="2310">Has great [utility] but there's the problem</p>
<p t="2573010" d="6929">there's a problem and the problem is it doesn't take into account the nested structure of this of your goal hierarchy and</p>
<p t="2580640" d="4790">What that means is that it underestimates the difficulty of responding to an error?</p>
<p t="2586430" d="5840">Because the problem with an error is that you don't know what the error signifies, and that's a huge problem</p>
<p t="2592270" d="3989">And that's part of what I want to delve into even in more depth today</p>
<p t="2596260" d="4530">And so this is like Ellis and the what in wonderland going down the rabbit hole it's exactly the same thing</p>
<p t="2600920" d="5360">That's the [hole] the rabbit hole is you made a mistake [right]? You made a mistake. You've got your</p>
<p t="2607040" d="1049">oversimplified</p>
<p t="2608089" d="6440">Representation of the World Laid upon it it validates itself in its execution [if] it executes properly if it executes</p>
<p t="2614750" d="5510">Improperly, [then] what does that signify and the answer isn't precisely that you've made a mistake</p>
<p t="2621070" d="1420">The answer is it</p>
<p t="2622490" d="5689">signifies that there's something in the world that you excluded that shouldn't have been excluded and that's a big problem because</p>
<p t="2628760" d="2000">when [you've] laid out a simplified</p>
<p t="2631490" d="6860">Schema on the world you've excluded virtually everything and so what that means is that as [soon] as you make an error</p>
<p t="2638750" d="5390">the search space for the error immediately tends towards the infinite and you experience that</p>
<p t="2644750" d="2000">It's part of it human</p>
<p t="2646820" d="4099">Existential experience and the way you experience that is especially if your mood is Shaky is</p>
<p t="2651620" d="7040">you lay [out] a small plan like maybe you go out for coffee with someone that you're romantically interested in and they're</p>
<p t="2659120" d="7069">There, they're not they're not pleasant to you and and so that's an error. It means well. What does it mean well?</p>
<p t="2666200" d="7250">You've construed yourself wrong. You've construed them wrong. You've construed the opposite sex wrong. You've construed human beings wrong</p>
<p t="2673550" d="3139">You're a walking catastrophe, [and] you might as well not even exist</p>
<p t="2677330" d="3859">It's like well, that's that's pretty extreme, but it's not that extreme</p>
<p t="2681190" d="5580">I'll tell you like it's not that uncommon for people to have exactly that set of catastrophic</p>
<p t="2687290" d="4370">Responses to even a minor Setback now. It's not good for them and I would say</p>
<p t="2692630" d="1800">you know just because you</p>
<p t="2694430" d="5330">Scraped your foot doesn't mean you should dig a grave and jump into [it] pull the dirt on on top of you. You know</p>
<p t="2699760" d="5280">So you don't want to start by taking yourself completely apart, but that doesn't mean people won't do it</p>
<p t="2705040" d="5040">They do it all the [time] in fact to me. It's always a mystery that they don't do it every single time</p>
<p t="2710840" d="4040">Because the logical inference for why didn't you get someone interested in?</p>
<p t="2715010" d="6290">You could easily be because you're a failure as a human being and at some level that's actually true now</p>
<p t="2721300" d="1260">It's all it's true in a way</p>
<p t="2722560" d="3479">That's not that helpful [right] because it's just too catastrophic</p>
<p t="2726200" d="5270">but it isn't obvious at all how people can defend themselves against that cascade of a</p>
<p t="2732470" d="1980">Kotak</p>
<p t="2734450" d="4400">Catastrophizing, [I] mean after all if you are everything you could be then maybe everyone would be attracted to you</p>
<p t="2738850" d="6089">I mean perhaps not but you get the point [and] no and no easy rationalization is going to let you just brush that away</p>
<p t="2745460" d="5390">Especially if you actually happen to be interested in the person because that's even worse because then not only are you rejected?</p>
<p t="2750850" d="1950">But you rejected [by] someone</p>
<p t="2752800" d="5010">Who's who upon whom you've projected an ideal or perhaps on?</p>
<p t="2758510" d="6350">From whom you've actually observed an ideal so it's worse you're you're rejected by someone that you want to have</p>
<p t="2765680" d="4610">Be [attractive] to you to validate your old miserable existence. It's a non-trivial problem</p>
<p t="2775250" d="2390">So you're in this protected space that I?</p>
<p t="2779120" d="2689">You know I made an analogy between that in the garden of eden</p>
<p t="2782630" d="7159">Or the city that buddha was raised it. It's all protected and everything inside it is beautiful and functional and</p>
<p t="2790490" d="4820">That's by definition because if your frame of reference is working properly</p>
<p t="2795310" d="5550">then what's within it is things you control that are functional and and and and</p>
<p t="2802190" d="2150">and they're serving your purposes, so</p>
<p t="2805880" d="1100">When you're successful</p>
<p t="2806980" d="5100">You're in the garden of Eden that's one way of [thinking] about it when the things that you're laying out in the world are delivering</p>
<p t="2812080" d="1330">What they're supposed to deliver</p>
<p t="2813410" d="4789">That's what you inhabit, but the problem is is that there's always a snake inside the garden</p>
<p t="2818200" d="4020">And it's that's the story that's echoed in the story of Buddha in that case</p>
<p t="2822220" d="4800">It's Buddha's own curiosity that happens to be the snake and you could actually say the same thing about human beings</p>
<p t="2827090" d="3079">Maybe it wasn't the snake maybe it was eve's curiosity</p>
<p t="2831200" d="1850">They're the same thing in some sense</p>
<p t="2833050" d="7080">And so it's Buddha's curiosity that drives them outside the city to find disease and death and to blow apart his</p>

<p t="2844340" d="3199">When we're looking at unit for universality</p>

<p t="2854600" d="6229">The second thing week it's and that's universally true the content of the story can differ. That's okay. I don't care about that</p>
<p t="2860930" d="5540">it's the structural equivalence that I'm interested in you live inside the story and you have to because</p>
<p t="2867380" d="3530">you have to live in something like that because you are [goal-directed] and you have to be and</p>
<p t="2871460" d="2570">You [have] to simplify the world because there you're just not</p>

<p t="2975500" d="4760">relationship success and the answer was now obviously it depends on how you would measure an</p>
<p t="2981079" d="5510">event and how you would measure positive and negative emotion, but that aside the finding was something like</p>
<p t="2987440" d="4010">If you're in a relationship, and you only have five positive</p>

<p t="3004829" d="6150">That's pretty bloody [acuter] what why in the world would that be don't you want like a hundred to one positive to [negative]?</p>

<p t="3208440" d="1470">the Rats are</p>
<p t="3209910" d="2389">We've got the burrows on one end of the little field</p>
<p t="3212880" d="6679">That hierarchy they're doing their [little] rat social things they're playing and they're laughing and they're tickling each other and they're there you're you know</p>

<p t="3221809" d="4800">Just fine rats in that situation by the way are very difficult to get addicted to cocaine</p>
<p t="3226949" d="4130">If you want to dick the rat to cocaine you have to put it in a cage and isolated</p>
<p t="3231180" d="4609">It's not really a rat any more than any more than you're a person if you're in solitary confinement, right?</p>
<p t="3235789" d="3120">I mean, you're sort you're mostly [your] just misery</p>
<p t="3239969" d="5120">Anyways in solitary confinement [you'd] be after cocaine non-stop and maybe under other circumstances</p>
<p t="3245309" d="3350">but like a normal [rat] it's not that interested in cocaine, so</p>
<p t="3249150" d="1260">Let's just decide</p>
<p t="3250410" d="539">No</p>
<p t="3250949" d="5360">[anyways] the rats are doing their thing and then they've learned that they can go out to the other side of the field and they</p>
<p t="3256309" d="2729">can get food [and] so one day the</p>
<p t="3259979" d="3950">experimenters instead of putting food out there put a cat out there and</p>
<p t="3264479" d="4820">the rat goes out and gets a whiff of the cat which they do not like and then the rat runs home and</p>
<p t="3269670" d="3319">Pokes is because of the burrow and screams for like two days</p>
<p t="3273569" d="2989">Ultrasonic LI and all the other rats are like frozen stiff because of that</p>
<p t="3276559" d="4900">They're not going anywhere, and so a 2-day rat screaming V is no a trivial [thing]</p>
<p t="3281460" d="2699">That's be I calculated that be the equivalent of use</p>
<p t="3284680" d="6320">Screaming for two weeks, so you have to be pretty upset to scream for two weeks, right, so this is hard on the rat</p>
<p t="3291000" d="4800">But the reason I'm telling you this is the rat doesn't expect the cat to be there the rat goes out</p>
<p t="3295800" d="2879">And there's a cat and what it uses is its predator</p>
<p t="3298840" d="7549">Detection and alert systems to signify the presence of the cat and what we've done with the dragon imagery Roughly speaking is make an amalgam</p>
<p t="3306390" d="5489">Of predatory monsters and state that's a symbol for what lurks Beyond safety</p>
<p t="3312520" d="3679">because we're observing our own responses in some sense and</p>
<p t="3316720" d="4340">And it's not only that we're observing our own responses, but we also have a category</p>
<p t="3321580" d="3770">Categorical set of responses to Predator and we again</p>
<p t="3325690" d="7070">There's no speculation about this we already know this like if you go study monkeys for example they have</p>
<p t="3333250" d="6290">Distinct sets of vocalization [that] are associated with Predator Detection that have distinct circuits</p>
<p t="3339580" d="4789">We know that there are predator Detection circuits, and it's not unreasonable [to] also</p>
<p t="3344920" d="5510">Presuppose that they underlie the phenomena for example that human beings are [very] good at learning fear to snakes</p>
<p t="3350830" d="4489">Snake fear might be innate like that's pushing the argument but at minimum</p>
<p t="3355600" d="6739">Psychologists have already concluded that even if snake fear isn't innate and it probably is that it can be learned like that</p>
<p t="3362590" d="3589">So you can condition people to be afraid of pictures of snakes?</p>
<p t="3367000" d="6020">way faster than you can condition them to be afraid of pictures of electrical outlets or handguns, so</p>
<p t="3373840" d="4939">And that's well documented. I don't think anybody disputes that at all, so</p>
<p t="3379570" d="1410">the first</p>
<p t="3380980" d="2510">Assumption is when something unexpected</p>
<p t="3384250" d="3050">Emerges, so we'll call that the snake in the garden that</p>
<p t="3388150" d="6020">Your prey and that's a predator and that the monster has come to get you. It's something like that now the</p>
<p t="3394960" d="5270">Representation of the Dragon is more complex than mere Monster because the dragon the mythological</p>
<p t="3400420" d="4850">Dragon also is the thing that hoards Treasure, and I really like that symbol</p>
<p t="3405270" d="2459">I think it's I think that's also why it will never go away</p>
<p t="3407730" d="4139">It's such a great symbol because it says well the unknown can take you down</p>
<p t="3411910" d="6069">[it] can it can right you with its fiery breath like poisonous snake and it can burn things like fire</p>
<p t="3417979" d="1390">and it's a</p>
<p t="3419369" d="5629">aerial predator that can take you from the air and it's a carnivorous predator that can take you from the ground and [it's]</p>
<p t="3425189" d="3080">Reptilian it's the sort of thing that can pull you down into the water</p>
<p t="3428369" d="3739">And it's easy to see that as an amalgam of of the threats that have been</p>
<p t="3432509" d="3139">Laid Forth for Human beings since the beginning of time and</p>
<p t="3436799" d="4729">Monster is an amalgam of predator, and you might say well. There's no such thing as a dragon. It's like. Yes</p>
<p t="3441529" d="2000">There is it's just a loose category</p>
<p t="3444449" d="3020">What's common across all [predators] equals dragon?</p>
<p t="3448529" d="5359">It's not like it's a knot. They're not real. They're hyper real. They're more real than the phenomena themselves</p>
<p t="3453889" d="6180">Just like an abstraction can be more real than the phenomena the result and then the canonical dragon for human beings isn't just a predator</p>
<p t="3460249" d="1870">We're not rabbits</p>
<p t="3462119" d="3049">You can imagine that the dragon for a rabbit is just a dragon</p>
<p t="3465169" d="7469">There's no damn treasure there at all but for human beings its ambivalent because the thing that you don't know about is</p>
<p t="3473039" d="2840">Also, the thing that holds the greatest gift and why is that?</p>
<p t="3476039" d="7639">It's [because] the unrealized world manifests itself when you make an error and the unrealized world is something that can take you down</p>
<p t="3484380" d="2959">Obviously, but it's also the source of all new information</p>
<p t="3488579" d="6500">it's an infinite source of information, and that's a really useful thing [to] know error is an infinite source of information and</p>

<p t="3520279" d="2639">It's like we've got this melodic thing going on</p>
<p t="3522919" d="6660">It's a consensual frame and something pokes itself up to put a disjunction in the conversation</p>

<p t="3814520" d="4350">The child Catches it and puts the puts the batter out and the batter bursts into tears</p>
<p t="3819270" d="7310">Well, what happens is the other kids you know the first time that happens they'll be sympathetic [the] third time that happens</p>
<p t="3826580" d="2000">They won't invite that kid out to play baseball anymore</p>
<p t="3829860" d="2000">so the answer to</p>
<p t="3832050" d="7340">We're not getting along is not you get to burst into tears and and and manifest extraordinary emotional distress because if you do that</p>
<p t="3840210" d="2000">no, one's going to want to play with you and</p>
<p t="3842790" d="7010">[that's] a lesson that many people could stand learning again one of the things. I think that's really destabilizing our society right [now]</p>

<p t="3852570" d="5300">Kids have been encouraged or allowed to play enough in the last</p>

<p t="3870320" d="3570">That's what you're doing when you pretend you're going to go along with that because we're going to play this out</p>
<p t="3873890" d="1480">It's like that's fine</p>
<p t="3875370" d="5989">You don't impose that though right not not if you're a kid that has a clue you invite people to play you don't insist on</p>
<p t="3881460" d="3020">Your identity and their compliance with it</p>
<p t="3884640" d="1790">It's not a playable game</p>

<p t="3887130" d="4489">You don't burst into tears and run off when [someone] won't play your game because then they won't play with you</p>
<p t="3891620" d="5429">And then you have to turn [to] force, and that's that's fine. If that's what you want to do, but you better look out because</p>

<p t="3953330" d="3659">I think that's I [think] that criticism is more emerging because of because it's apparently</p>
<p t="3957480" d="7280">it's apparently paradoxical and they've laid out a set of principles to which in principle they they adhere and</p>
<p t="3966120" d="5150">One of those principles is to reduce the destructive power of the patriarchy it's like okay</p>
<p t="3971580" d="5420">There is some destructive Patriarchy for you radio silence. It's like hmM now</p>
<p t="3977000" d="3899">What am I supposed to do about that am I supposed to question your adherence to those principles?</p>
<p t="3980900" d="5910">Which is exactly what should be done, so I think it's a it's it's a criticism of performative contradiction</p>
<p t="3987150" d="7010">[you] say you're for this, but when it comes to acted out you don't selectively in this situation, so there's something wrong</p>
<p t="3994260" d="7099">There's something about your game that you're not being straight about that's the criticism, and maybe there's rejoinders to that you know</p>
<p t="4003020" d="2000">Well, okay, okay? Well</p>
<p t="4005420" d="3560">responsibility well you know then you'd have to look at different levels of</p>
<p t="4009920" d="5630">Analysis with regards to interactions. You definitely have a responsibility to your partner and</p>
<p t="4016400" d="4699">Your children okay, so your responsibility to your children as far as I'm concerned is</p>
<p t="4022010" d="5449">don't it's twofold one don't let your children do anything that makes you dislike them and</p>
<p t="4028160" d="1160">There's a corollary to that</p>
<p t="4029320" d="6779">which is don't be an idiot you know so that's partly why you need a partner because your partner has to tell you when your</p>
<p t="4036290" d="5869">Demands on your children are excessive because you're kind of you know you're not 100% oriented properly</p>
<p t="4042200" d="2839">but still you're their target adult and</p>
<p t="4045470" d="6319">So it's up to you to help them choose a path that makes you want them to be around right?</p>
<p t="4052730" d="6919">And that that's your critical responsibility, and hopefully you're enough of an an analog of the broader community</p>
<p t="4060710" d="3739">so that if they can figure out how to get along with you it radically increases the</p>
<p t="4064579" d="4969">Probability that they'll be able to get along with everyone so for example if you're playing with your children</p>
<p t="4070400" d="1439">two years old</p>
<p t="4071839" d="3920">You you help them you encourage them to play in a manner</p>
<p t="4075760" d="630">That's fun</p>
<p t="4076390" d="6149">And if you get that down, then you know when you introduce them to another child don't know how to play in a manner</p>
<p t="4082539" d="2000">That's fun, and so great</p>
<p t="4084920" d="6320">You've solved the problem the problem is to get your child to enter into the collaborative social world, and so yes</p>
<p t="4091240" d="5729">You have a primary responsibility for that and then with regards to your partner. Here's something to think about</p>
<p t="4097310" d="5359">With regards to role so my wife and I have had this discussion many times and one of the discussions is well</p>
<p t="4102670" d="1989">How are we to treat each other in public?</p>
<p t="4104659" d="3650">And it isn't her name is Tammy the discussion isn't</p>
<p t="4108469" d="6140">How should Jordon treat Tammy in public or how should tammy treat Jordan that's not the discussion this isn't personal</p>
<p t="4114909" d="4560">It's how should a wife treat her husband, and how should a husband treat his wife</p>
<p t="4119469" d="5250">It's impersonal and it's partly you don't put your partner down in public</p>
<p t="4125179" d="3350">Why well it's not because you're hurting that person's feelings</p>
<p t="4128529" d="4800">That's not why it's that you're denigrating the relationship that you are in voluntarily</p>
<p t="4133699" d="3950">You know I've some of the most painful days. I've ever spent one in particular</p>
<p t="4137650" d="3750">I spent with a group of men who had been in therapy for their marriage and</p>
<p t="4141529" d="2450">who bloody well needed that I can tell you that and</p>
<p t="4144440" d="5299">They spent their whole day complaining about their wives. I could just made me sweat the whole day</p>
<p t="4149739" d="2370">I thought I can't believe I'm here with you guys that I</p>
<p t="4152389" d="4010">Can't tell you why I was it's just you know it was just happenstance more than anything</p>
<p t="4156400" d="3180">And I thought how can you be so damn dumb it's like</p>
<p t="4159580" d="5129">It's certainly possible that you marriage barbaric married Barbarian witches fine</p>
<p t="4165020" d="7590">You don't have you're so lacking in sense that you would discuss that in public not noticing that you picked them</p>
<p t="4172920" d="7609">So basically all you're doing is holding up a sign and waving it constantly that says I'm an idiot. I'm an idiot right and so</p>
<p t="4181500" d="1410">well</p>
<p t="4182910" d="2000">back to responsibility</p>
<p t="4185070" d="6500">You have a responsibility to those whom you love and are obligated to</p>
<p t="4192300" d="6379">To ensure that they manifest themselves in a manner that's most beneficial to them over the long run</p>
<p t="4199590" d="6229">Now you have the same responsibilities. I would say to yourself, but you'll have blind spots other people have to help you with that</p>
<p t="4206100" d="5450">But so the rule is you know you don't let you don't you help your wife figure out?</p>
<p t="4211550" d="6209">How not to make [a] fool [of] herself in public and she extends to you the same courtesy and it's partly</p>
<p t="4218280" d="6049">Maintenance of the sacred Nature of the relationship it has nothing to do with you or her precisely</p>
<p t="4224520" d="5659">It's broader and wider than that okay, so then that's two levels of responsibility child</p>
<p t="4230700" d="2060">partner next level of responsibility</p>
<p t="4234300" d="4850">You're asked at your workplace to go uncut to undergo unconscious bias retraining</p>
<p t="4239970" d="2000">You say yes, it's like okay</p>
<p t="4242430" d="4610">You've just admitted that you're a bigot right because you're acting about it's like</p>
<p t="4247040" d="4289">I'm a racist bigot obviously I need [to] be retrained and so you might say well</p>
<p t="4251330" d="5670">I'm not going to make a fuss about it right or I've been told to do it for maybe you agree with it fine and</p>
<p t="4257160" d="3890">If that if you agree with it, no problem, you can make a case for it</p>
<p t="4261050" d="4979">I [think] it's a weak and appalling case personally, but you can make a case [for] it</p>
<p t="4266030" d="2609">you could say well, you know why I'm interested in my</p>
<p t="4269250" d="3829">Biases and how to rectify them and like fair enough, you know people are biased</p>
<p t="4273600" d="4430">But if you object to it, and you don't say anything</p>
<p t="4278850" d="2000">then you're complicit and</p>
<p t="4280980" d="3439">then it's on you, and you know like a</p>
<p t="4286080" d="4790">Causes [B] and C and B causes C and D and so forth the thing tends does noise?</p>
<p t="4290870" d="6150">But it has this tendency to expand and you'll come home angry and upset and [you'll] go to the training program</p>
<p t="4297020" d="4229">And you'll think this is ridiculous because that is what you'll think in all likelihood, and you won't say anything</p>
<p t="4302010" d="2270">But it eats at you well</p>
<p t="4305239" d="3600">Gated your responsibility and so and then you might say well</p>
<p t="4308840" d="7169">So then then that's how the community becomes corrupt that's how the community starts to be corrupt is that people turn a blind eye to</p>
<p t="4316560" d="4640">Emergent Pathology when they know it's pathological. That's exactly what the egyptian story says</p>
<p t="4322020" d="1560">Osiris is</p>
<p t="4323580" d="1920">overcome by Seth</p>
<p t="4325500" d="2000">Because he's willfully blind</p>
<p t="4328260" d="2810">Willfully blind which means he knows?</p>
<p t="4331950" d="5719">But refuses to he knows quote his predator Detection systems have gone off</p>
<p t="4338520" d="4850">Monster well, then you're supposed to look okay? Exactly what sort of monster is this what doesn't have wings?</p>
<p t="4343370" d="2699">it doesn't have a tail you know you cut it down into the</p>
<p t="4346350" d="4250">You cut it from the monster that it could be into the monster that it is</p>
<p t="4350880" d="7250">That's the first step and then you take the appropriate steps and then you also notice the other monsters because here's something [to] think about</p>
<p t="4361200" d="2000">You're going to pay a price for speaking up</p>
<p t="4363690" d="2000">But you're going to pay a price for not speaking up</p>
<p t="4366360" d="6680">So it's like monsters on the right monsters on the left pick the ones you want to battle with if you decide not to</p>
<p t="4373890" d="1680">Make your stand</p>
<p t="4375570" d="3439">You weaken yourself if you do it a hundred times</p>
<p t="4379860" d="2930">Then even if the monster was only this big now</p>
<p t="4382790" d="4020">You're this big it's going to eat you you know when it was this big you probably could have kicked it across the room</p>
<p t="4386810" d="5459">It's too late for that you've capitulated and capitulated you know and so what what you've done?</p>
<p t="4392640" d="3049">And this is a way to think about it from a union perspective</p>
<p t="4395690" d="6359">This is what jung was trying to get [at] when he was talking about elka elka me. It's like the thing that pops up</p>
<p t="4402660" d="1290">to</p>
<p t="4403950" d="1920">object to you is</p>
<p t="4405870" d="2000">this incredibly complex</p>
<p t="4408840" d="3379">Entity it's it's the entire world encapsulated in the event</p>
<p t="4413670" d="1790">If you interact with it</p>
<p t="4415460" d="7109">You unpack it you differentiate your sense of the world and you and you you gather new skills, so for example</p>
<p t="4422670" d="5180">Let's say there's something going on at your workplace, and you need to object to it cuz it's driving you crazy</p>
<p t="4427850" d="3600">And you talk it over with your wife so that you've got your head screwed on straight say</p>
<p t="4431450" d="2729">Oh, I've got to say something and you go there, and you say something</p>
<p t="4434180" d="2459">And you know you're stumbling and awkward and all of that</p>
<p t="4436640" d="5910">But but you watch the response and maybe you get what you're aiming at. Maybe you don't but you've learned a bunch</p>
<p t="4442550" d="3449">You've learned while I noticed coherent as I could be I'm not as good at putting my arguments together</p>
<p t="4446330" d="4020">My boss is more of a son of a bitch than I that he thought it was this is a worse problem that I knew</p>
<p t="4450350" d="1630">about it's like</p>
<p t="4451980" d="5090">Differentiated differentiated so now the landscape is higher resolution and so are you?</p>
<p t="4457530" d="1070">Well so good</p>
<p t="4458600" d="1450">So maybe you're a little bit next</p>
<p t="4460050" d="4459">Better prepared the next time you have to do that and so the issue here to some degree is</p>
<p t="4466440" d="6110">Don't lose an opportunity to grapple with something that objects to you, especially when the object</p>
<p t="4473190" d="2000">Objection is rather small</p>
<p t="4475410" d="2689">Because that's something you can you say well, I can put up with it</p>
<p t="4478130" d="3299">It's like fair enough like you don't want to make everything into a war</p>
<p t="4481430" d="6270">I usually use a rule of three if we're interacting and you do something that I find disruptive. I'll note it</p>
<p t="4487730" d="6479">It's like potential dragon go on and I'll leave it be and then if you do it again. I think oh yeah</p>
<p t="4495300" d="2000">That probably wasn't merely</p>
<p t="4497850" d="6319">Situation but I'll leave it be because that's still not enough evidence, but if you do it a third [time], then I'll say hey</p>
<p t="4504170" d="5430">I just noticed this and you'll say no that didn't happen and I'll say yeah, not only did it happen</p>
<p t="4509600" d="3600">But it happened here, and it happened here, [and] I'm not making this up</p>
<p t="4513200" d="4439">So there's something going on here like I'm not ignoring it and we can get to the bottom of it</p>
<p t="4517700" d="4469">And then they'll come [up] with a bunch of objections about why that isn't necessary and you push those aside</p>
<p t="4522170" d="3240">[and] they'll come up with [a] few more objections, and they'll push those aside</p>
<p t="4525480" d="4760">And then usually they'll get mad or burst into tears and if you push that aside</p>
<p t="4531150" d="2000">Then you get to have a conversation</p>
<p t="4533700" d="2149">Right and then you can solve the problem</p>
<p t="4535850" d="390">but man</p>
<p t="4536240" d="7859">it's you got to be a monster because first of all you need six arguments about why they're objections aren't going to stop you and</p>
<p t="4544380" d="7729">then you have to not be intimidated by the Anger and you have to not be swamped by compassion about the tears and</p>
<p t="4553410" d="3319">Then you can have a conversation and people don't do that</p>
<p t="4556730" d="780">They won't do that</p>
<p t="4557510" d="4379">And so they don't solve the problems and so then the problems accrue</p>
<p t="4562380" d="6469">Right and if they accrue over 15 years of a relationship then that then they end up fat ugly and in divorce court</p>
<p t="4569820" d="2000">so and that's you know, that's not a</p>
<p t="4572360" d="2000">That's not a great outcome. It's an it's</p>
<p t="4574950" d="2000">Divorce Court and cancer are</p>
<p t="4578130" d="3440">similar in their in their seriousness, not always, but</p>
<p t="4582510" d="6500">But sufficiently often so when that error emerges it's a it's a glimmering</p>
<p t="4589890" d="1200">now</p>
<p t="4591090" d="4790">You know we talked a lot about the hierarchical structure of goals you know and so</p>
<p t="4596520" d="1650">Here's something</p>
<p t="4598170" d="2000">here's something to think about so</p>
<p t="4600390" d="2000">the thing that</p>
<p t="4602700" d="2719">Announces itself is error has a two-fold nature</p>
<p t="4605730" d="5689">That's because it's Chaos and order at the same time or it's because it's all the archetypal structures at the same time</p>
<p t="4611420" d="5790">It's dragon of Chaos. It's the great mother positive and negative. It's the great father positive and negative. It's the</p>
<p t="4617730" d="4490">Individual hero and adversary all of that manifests itself in the moment of error</p>
<p t="4622500" d="3800">Right the architects come forward did you make an error because you're a bad person?</p>
<p t="4627090" d="6650">Could be now so so one of the things to [think] about with regards to that is you know in the mesopotamian creation story?</p>
<p t="4634260" d="1050">when</p>
<p t="4635310" d="4010">When when time out comes flooding back. It's so interesting that story</p>
<p t="4641220" d="1920">You think about what she does?</p>
<p t="4643140" d="5149">So she's the archetype of error. Let's say the error that can take you out that can dissolve you in salt water</p>
<p t="4649470" d="2000">tears</p>
<p t="4651930" d="8000">Well, she's irritated because absolute was destroyed so that the structure is gone carelessness is destroyed the structure up comes time at she's not happy</p>
<p t="4660510" d="4459">What does she do she prepares a Phalanx of Monstrous Monsters?</p>
<p t="4664970" d="5129">It's exactly what the story says she produces a whole horde of monsters to come at you</p>
<p t="4670680" d="2299">and she [puts] king you at their head and</p>
<p t="4674040" d="2000">Kenya was the king of the Monsters and</p>
<p t="4676320" d="7489">Later so he's the ultimate bad guy he's satan for all intents and purposes in the mesopotamian version. It's out of him that</p>
<p t="4684840" d="7070">Marduk makes human beings out of his blood that marduk makes human beings. That's a critical issue man the mesopotamian said</p>
<p t="4693360" d="3950">Imagine the worst monster you can possibly imagine the king of all the monsters</p>
<p t="4698190" d="2330">That's the blood of human beings</p>
<p t="4701220" d="1140">Wow</p>
<p t="4702360" d="2000">So what does that mean?</p>
<p t="4704610" d="2560">Well it means that one of the terrible things that lurks</p>
<p t="4707900" d="2449">Let's say that you've been in a long-term</p>
<p t="4711079" d="3560">Relationship and it collapses let's say you were</p>
<p t="4715280" d="5450">You know you had a tendency towards alcoholism. You weren't so great with regards to your drug use [you]</p>
<p t="4721309" d="3650">[know] that conscientious, and you had like four or five kind of</p>
<p t="4725929" d="2629">low-rent affairs, and you know it</p>
<p t="4729710" d="2000">your marriage collapses bang</p>
<p t="4732289" d="3170">Well who do you first meet when you fall into Chaos?</p>
<p t="4735980" d="5059">You meet king of the monsters and he's you it's like. Why did my marriage fall apart?</p>
<p t="4741039" d="4680">[what] did I do wrong bang bang bang bang? [I] [did] all these things well? Why?</p>
<p t="4746599" d="4820">Because that thing inhabits me. What is it well? That's the most horrifying question</p>
<p t="4752119" d="1500">Well, that's why</p>
<p t="4753619" d="3379">So down there in the archetypal space all these things lurk</p>
<p t="4757789" d="4850">The hero and the adversary you've just met the adversary right well</p>
<p t="4762639" d="7590">Maybe your tyrant that's certainly possible. Maybe everything around you was chaotic. So what do you encounter when things fall apart you?</p>
<p t="4771260" d="7970">[encounter] the adversary you encounter the tyrant you encounter the catastrophe of nature and you encounter the dragon of the Chaos, and they're all intermingled</p>
<p t="4780769" d="4280">You have to sort that out. That's what happens to Ellis when she goes down the rabbit hole right she meets</p>
<p t="4785900" d="1830">the Red Queen</p>
<p t="4787730" d="2000">[and] the red queen is always running around</p>
<p t="4790099" d="5419">Off with their heads off with her heads and she says in my kingdom you have to run as fast as you can just to</p>
<p t="4795519" d="1631">Stay in the same place</p>
<p t="4797150" d="2449">right down the rabbit hole you meet the archetypes and</p>
<p t="4800539" d="2000">so</p>
<p t="4802760" d="6859">Okay, so back to [responsibilities] well one of the things solzhenitsyn detailed. We said well, how does societies. Go corrupt said it's easy</p>
<p t="4811039" d="2090">one Little sin at a time</p>
<p t="4814550" d="3290">You go to work someone's lording it over you you know that they're tyrannical?</p>
<p t="4818659" d="2959">You don't have the wherewithal to stand up. It's like okay</p>
<p t="4822559" d="2000">You're a slave</p>
<p t="4824840" d="6350">And so if you continue to agree [to] be a slave you will continue to generate tyrants</p>
<p t="4832099" d="5720">Right and the only thing that can stop you from doing that. I think is the right kind of terror. It's like careful</p>
<p t="4837820" d="1839">What you give up?</p>
<p t="4839659" d="2899">Because that's this [logos] okay, so so [alright]</p>
<p t="4842689" d="4040">that's this logos the logos is the thing that enables you to mediate between a</p>
<p t="4847010" d="3949">Between order and Chaos and maybe you have to have some faith in that it's like well</p>
<p t="4850959" d="2000">What should you do [if] someone is harassing you?</p>
<p t="4853099" d="2899">Well, you should fight back okay? What is that?</p>
<p t="4855999" d="6750">What's the most effective way to fight back well sometimes it's physical, but that's not necessarily for the best</p>
<p t="4863749" d="1790">Maybe it's through articulation</p>
<p t="4865539" d="6030">Maybe it's through analysis right you want to be sharp you want to be able to decompose a problem you want to be able to?</p>
<p t="4871760" d="5060">Formulate an argument and a counter response and maybe you want to be so good at that that people don't mess with you to begin</p>
<p t="4876820" d="6029">With and then you're a perfectly articulate counter monster, and you never have to take your sword out</p>
<p t="4883579" d="3770">That's that's the place that you want to be. It's like people should know</p>
<p t="4888050" d="5959">after three seconds of interacting with you that harassing you [would] be a seriously bad idea and then</p>
<p t="4894769" d="2000">You'll have a perfectly fine time with them</p>
<p t="4897559" d="4760">So and that's part of you know, so there's some utility in meeting the devil in the underworld</p>
<p t="4903110" d="3739">Right because maybe he's got something to teach you that's certainly possible that</p>
<p t="4907309" d="2510">[and] one of the things that you can be taught is that your</p>
<p t="4910579" d="5720">Normative morality which is basically your harmlessness and your naivety masquerading as virtue is</p>
<p t="4917809" d="7040">Completely insufficient to protect you in the world especially against the sorts of things [that] you're talking about which are tyrant tyranny</p>
<p t="4925939" d="3140">Tyrants will push until you push back. It's in their nature</p>
<p t="4929719" d="2000">They don't have internal controls</p>
<p t="4931849" d="5180">So they just push and push and push and push and push and push even kids do that like little kids</p>
<p t="4937030" d="3750">Do that all the time they'll just push you until they hit that wall they're actually quite</p>
<p t="4940780" d="4229">Happy when they hit a wall because the last thing a child wants is a universe without walls</p>
<p t="4945860" d="4879">It terrifies them right they want to see while I'm in a swimming pool. There's an edge</p>
<p t="4950739" d="3179">They don't want to see oh, no this isn't a swimming pool</p>
<p t="4953919" d="3300">This is [an] ocean [I'm] in the middle of an ocean I'm going to drown</p>
<p t="4957889" d="4189">That's a terrible thing for children. That's why they need discipline and structure because</p>
<p t="4962719" d="4910">It's consistency and predictability and routine and all the things that are extraordinarily</p>
<p t="4968239" d="5480">helpful to them okay, so now think of that hierarchy [that] we talked about so</p>
<p t="4975200" d="3110">You're not in a story. You're in nested stories</p>
<p t="4978310" d="7589">And the nested stories round themselves in action [in] actual embodied action, so if you're going to sit if you're going to be a good</p>
<p t="4987080" d="2029">partner maybe you help</p>
<p t="4990140" d="5060">Prepare the meals and to help prepare the meals means you pick up a plate with your hand</p>
<p t="4995200" d="4590">And you move it physically through space, and you put it on the table. That's where it stops being an abstraction</p>
<p t="5000310" d="2059">So at the bottom of an ethical</p>
<p t="5003280" d="1890">Hierarchy of value are</p>
<p t="5005170" d="5810">actions not things that's the scientific world, but actions and</p>
<p t="5011890" d="2000">then you can</p>
<p t="5014170" d="3859">label the actions with abstractions as you move up the hierarchy, so</p>
<p t="5018250" d="3080">You're good at setting the table so that means you're good at making dinner</p>
<p t="5021330" d="3809">so that means that you've got one element of good being a good partner [in] place and</p>
<p t="5025420" d="3770">being a good partner is one element of being a good person and so</p>
<p t="5029560" d="4489">You you're not so good at setting the table, and you say well. I'm [not] a good person. It's like well</p>
<p t="5034050" d="4290">No, you should go down [to] the higher resolution levels of the hierarchy and start there</p>
<p t="5038340" d="7379">and that's what you do when you're arguing with [people], but there's another thing that's really useful about conceptualizing the Hierarchy in this manner, so</p>
<p t="5048310" d="1490">So I think what we'll do is</p>
<p t="5049800" d="5549">We'll stop now [for] 10 minutes and all because I want to bring up this diagram because what I want to do next is</p>
<p t="5056500" d="3229">it's a bleak story at the moment because the story is something like</p>
<p t="5060700" d="5180">You're going to lay out oversimplifications in the world, and they're going to be prone to catastrophic error, and then you have to encounter</p>
<p t="5065880" d="7049">What's terrifying in order to Progress and so what that means is that progression is always dependent on terror something like that</p>
<p t="5072930" d="4950">And there's some truth [in] that and that's why people don't progress, but it's not a sufficient truth</p>
<p t="5077880" d="5549">And I want to unpack that when we come back, so let's come back in 10 minutes, and then I'll die can unpack that</p>
<p t="5084760" d="3260">There's this parable in the new testament [that] just came to mind</p>
<p t="5088780" d="3709">I'm going to mangle it a bit because it's not one that I have well memorized but</p>
<p t="5093850" d="4430">And I'm probably going to conflate two or three stories together, but I think I think [I've] got it, right</p>
<p t="5099190" d="3770">Christ is walking down the road and someone picks them up</p>
<p t="5103719" d="2000">the person is rich and</p>
<p t="5105829" d="1410">and</p>
<p t="5107239" d="2000">like well wealthy and</p>
<p t="5109820" d="3560">He has a talk they have a talk and the wealthy man, basically</p>
<p t="5114530" d="3080">tells him all the things that are wrong with his life and</p>
<p t="5118880" d="2719">then he asks him what he should do about it and</p>
<p t="5122479" d="4280">Chris says to him you have to give up everything you own and follow me</p>
<p t="5127059" d="3030">And that's often be read as a criticism of wealth</p>
<p t="5130090" d="6000">And that's actually not what the story means what the story means is this this guy has a lot of wealth</p>
<p t="5136090" d="4649">but he's still miserable and so that means that what he has is the</p>
<p t="5141079" d="5870">Obstacle to what he could be and so that's the message of the [story] is that if you're miserable with what you have then you?</p>
<p t="5146949" d="3569">have to let go of what you have so that maybe you could have something else and</p>
<p t="5150860" d="3830">And so and then there's some commentary on that story</p>
<p t="5154690" d="6270">I think other people are listening and they say well if that's the price to be paid then</p>
<p t="5161539" d="3410">no one is ever going to pay it, and I think that's where the</p>
<p t="5165469" d="5600">statement it is easier for a man to go through the eye of a needle for a camel to go through an eye of</p>
<p t="5171530" d="5540">The eye of a needle than for a rich man to [enter] paradise. [I] believe that's the derivation of that</p>
<p t="5177590" d="6259">Story and like I said that's been read as a critique of wealth, but it isn't it's a critique of attachment now</p>
<p t="5183849" d="2000">You know in the buddhist doctrine</p>
<p t="5187400" d="2000">one of the</p>
<p t="5190159" d="3379">impediments to enlightenment is attachment and</p>
<p t="5193909" d="5240">People read that as saying. Well you shouldn't care for anything in the world, and that's there's a nihilism</p>
<p t="5199150" d="6689">That's associated with that and not and there is a strong nihilistic tendency in buddhism that has to do with</p>
<p t="5207110" d="1949">Abandonment of the world do you see that in?</p>
<p t="5209059" d="5660">Christianity to some degree with people going off to lead ascetic lives and to you know it's part of multiple religious</p>
<p t="5215269" d="1491">traditions that idea of asceticism</p>
<p t="5216760" d="6600">and there's some utility in it if it is your attachment say to material things or status or whatever that's</p>
<p t="5223820" d="7250">Interfering with your pSychological progression now the idea is that you [should] let go of whatever it is that's interfering with your pSychological</p>
<p t="5231349" d="4729">Progression because no matter how valuable what it is. That's interfering is</p>
<p t="5236619" d="2000">It's not as valuable as what you're giving up</p>
<p t="5240409" d="4819">Okay, however the Criticism still stands and the Criticism was well</p>
<p t="5245229" d="4410">if the task is that difficult then no one's going to do it and</p>
<p t="5250159" d="2000">so in in</p>
<p t="5252349" d="5750">the Brothers karamazov, [there's] a famous story called the Grand inquisitor and</p>
<p t="5259189" d="2000">it's a story told by</p>
<p t="5262699" d="5989">Ivan karamasoff to his brother [Elia] and Ivan is a very</p>
<p t="5269959" d="1470">High-status</p>
<p t="5271429" d="2000">intelligent attractive</p>
<p t="5273469" d="2000">Tough minded</p>
<p t="5275599" d="1710">Soldier and</p>
<p t="5277309" d="5600">Alyosha is his younger brother and he's kind of softer and less rational</p>
<p t="5283669" d="1260">more</p>
<p t="5284929" d="1260">spiritual and</p>
<p t="5286189" d="7220">also training to be a no vitiate at the local monastery and Ivan likes to tear strips off it because he's a</p>
<p t="5293869" d="5120">cynic and an atheist and and and in Dostoyevsky's normal</p>
<p t="5299570" d="3199">Brilliant Manner he makes Ivan an incredibly powerful</p>
<p t="5303679" d="1590">articulate and</p>
<p t="5305269" d="5330">Admirable character, so when dostoyevsky wants to take someone on in his literary investigations</p>
<p t="5310599" d="2850">He doesn't take his enemy and turn him into some sort of weak</p>
<p t="5314179" d="5959">Puppet he takes his enemy and turns them into the strongest possible enemy he can imagine and then</p>
<p t="5320780" d="3649">Goes to battle against that it's a hallmark of Great literature</p>
<p t="5324429" d="2969">It's what distinguishes dusty sp for example from [Ain] Rand</p>
<p t="5327739" d="6259">Because what ain't rand does is she takes her she's a darling of the I would [say] libertarian, right?</p>
<p t="5334369" d="1641">She takes her enemies</p>
<p t="5336010" d="5429">And they're all the same first of all every single one of her negative characters is exactly the same as every other one</p>
<p t="5341439" d="5130">And they're all bad you know there's there's no redeeming qualities whatsoever in them</p>
<p t="5346570" d="4649">And they also I would say make their weak characters who make weak arguments</p>
<p t="5351219" d="3419">That's not the way to progress the way to progress is to take your enemy</p>
<p t="5354949" d="5209">Seriously and to even inflate them into something Beyond their [capacity] to inflate themselves</p>
<p t="5360199" d="6080">and then see if you can hammer out a solution to the genuine problem that's being posed anyway, so</p>
<p t="5366859" d="4670">Dusty else he does that brilliantly always and what makes him, so absolutely remarkable</p>
<p t="5372530" d="2629">But anyways, I even tells le Osha this story</p>
<p t="5375530" d="5330">He calls it the [grand] [inquisitor] and that in the story christ comes back to [Earth] in the Spanish inquisition</p>
<p t="5380990" d="2989">[and] he's he's out by a fountain and</p>
<p t="5384470" d="5839">People sort of notice him and he starts performing miracles and a big crowd Gathers around and it's like happy days. You know</p>
<p t="5391190" d="3229">But then the inquisitor shows up this old, you know harsh</p>
<p t="5395150" d="4760">Tyrannical guy and he has his guards arrest him [he] [throws] them in Prison and</p>
<p t="5401900" d="2720">so now christ is in prison and the</p>
<p t="5405140" d="5569">Inquisitor comes down and says to him while you're probably wondering why which are you in prison you know?</p>
<p t="5410900" d="6290">especially given that were the members [of] the you know were the representatives of the church that you hypothetically found it and and</p>
<p t="5417950" d="3410">christ remains silent through this entire episode and</p>
<p t="5423410" d="4339">the inquisitor basically says look you know you laid down this ethic that</p>
<p t="5429170" d="2000">it's wonderful, but it's</p>
<p t="5431180" d="1160">Superhuman no one can do it</p>
<p t="5432340" d="5699">It's asking way too much, and so you're you put the burden you put on people was just far too great</p>
<p t="5438040" d="5729">And so what we've done in the catholic church in the centuries since the church was founded is was lightened the load</p>
<p t="5443770" d="4439">we said well we take ordinary people and say well there here are some things you can do to be a little bit better and</p>
<p t="5448210" d="4620">You [know] we've instituted confession and repentance and all that we've kind of toned it down</p>
<p t="5453050" d="2869">So that the average person has some hope of progress</p>
<p t="5455920" d="5070">And we're making Headway and the last bloody thing we need around here is you coming back and like?</p>
<p t="5461180" d="5509">Screwing up all our all our good efforts is like. It was nice to have you around once but once was plenty man</p>
<p t="5466690" d="1050">We don't need you around anymore</p>
<p t="5467740" d="5520">and so christ listens to this doesn't say anything and then the inquisitor turns to leave and</p>
<p t="5473540" d="4850">Christ grabs him and kisses him on the lips and the inquisitor turns white and</p>
<p t="5478550" d="3409">Then leaves and when he leaves the door he leaves the door open</p>
<p t="5481990" d="3209">And that's the end of the story and it's an amazing story</p>
<p t="5485200" d="4859">It's an absolutely remarkable story in every possible way and and you know</p>
<p t="5491030" d="6169">Dostoevsky was objecting to some degree to the tyranny [of] the catholic church or even of the Christian church for that matter</p>
<p t="5497200" d="4080">But the thing that he did [that] was so damn brilliant is that he even made the inquisitor leave the door open</p>
<p t="5502070" d="5550">No, and as a [bellas] critique of Catholicism even during the inquisition. It's so brilliant</p>
<p t="5507750" d="6439">It's so emblematic of dostoyevsky's take on the world that he criticized the inquisitorial</p>
<p t="5514950" d="7129">Aspect of Christianity and of course, it's the tyrannical aspect of any belief system, but noted that they bloody well left the door open</p>
<p t="5522470" d="2369">Right so it's Brilliant. It's Brilliant</p>
<p t="5525420" d="6709">It's it's it's remarkable. So anyways the whole point that I'm making here. Is that there are terrible?</p>
<p t="5532680" d="2000">impediments to enlightenment and</p>
<p t="5535080" d="5060">the light is the impediments are the necessity of sacrifice and the necessity area of</p>
<p t="5540480" d="4399">Necessity of the Voluntary acceptance of suffering [I] mean you see that in buddhism</p>
<p t="5544880" d="3810">You know because one [of] the canons of [buddhist] one of the fundamental [principles] of buddhism</p>
<p t="5548690" d="4050">Is that life is suffering and that attachment makes it worse and well?</p>
<p t="5553470" d="3109">It isn't it isn't precisely attachment [its]</p>
<p t="5557880" d="7100">Attachment to things such that you cannot release the things when it's time to let them go [right] [so] like you're a Phoenix</p>
<p t="5565320" d="5210">You're [a] hundred years old your feathers. They're not working anymore, right? You're all wrinkly you're done</p>
<p t="5570540" d="2899">It's time to burst into flames and be reborn</p>
<p t="5573440" d="3540">but you don't want to burn off your feathers you want to cling to them and</p>
<p t="5577110" d="2870">That's not good because you have to be willing to undergo that</p>
<p t="5580740" d="2000">Transformation process and that involves</p>
<p t="5583020" d="5089">Like you know if you if you take your po self apart because you've made a mistake and you find out</p>
<p t="5588330" d="2000">What it is about you that's not?</p>
<p t="5590670" d="1130">Set up properly</p>
<p t="5591800" d="5610">And that's why the mistake occurred that's really going to happen for example when an intimate relationship breaks down</p>
<p t="5597600" d="2540">then you have to be in a position where you're willing to let</p>
<p t="5600570" d="600">the</p>
<p t="5601170" d="6500">Errors that are part of your character that define you right they might even be part of your [identity] you have to let you have</p>
<p t="5607670" d="4050">To be willing to let them go you have to be willing to let them burn off and that's a hell of a thing to</p>
<p t="5611720" d="7560">Ask and so then the [question] might be well is there a less radical solution to the problem then then then?</p>
<p t="5619890" d="5659">Crucifixion and resurrection or the total emulation and regeneration because that's the archetypal</p>
<p t="5626220" d="5689">What's that's the archetypal end point that if you want to put your self together you have to die and be reborn?</p>
<p t="5631910" d="2129">[I] mean that in that motif comes up all the [time]</p>
<p t="5634980" d="7020">In in popular popular stories and in mythology and so they here's here's</p>
<p t="5642280" d="3259">How I think that problem can be?</p>
<p t="5646510" d="2000">resolved so</p>
<p t="5649150" d="3199">Let's go back to the Enochian Story momentarily</p>
<p t="5652930" d="6379">so what happens and that the pinocchio story to me [is] analogous in its structure to the sermon on the mount so I'm going to</p>
<p t="5659310" d="700">make a</p>
<p t="5660010" d="4819">Parallel between those two things so basically what the [sermon] on the [mount] suggests is that?</p>
<p t="5665470" d="1350">you should</p>
<p t="5666820" d="5449">conceptualize the highest good that you're capable of conceptualizing and orient yourself towards that and</p>
<p t="5672640" d="2419">That having done that you [should] live in the moment</p>
<p t="5676090" d="2000">So it's not like you should live in the moment</p>
<p t="5678640" d="3439">It doesn't say [that] because that's often christ the hippie</p>
<p t="5682080" d="3390">You know so the hippies who have adopted that or that?</p>
<p t="5685930" d="3439">That's sort of that that element of Christianity say well</p>
<p t="5689370" d="1960">you live for the moment you know and and</p>
<p t="5691330" d="5330">And in meditation and other practices some of the attempt is to get you to live in the moment</p>
<p t="5696700" d="3080">But you know just to tell people to live in the moment</p>
<p t="5699780" d="4890">It's like what what the hell kind of advice is that what about the future? You know that is not helpful advice</p>
<p t="5705400" d="6020">Somebody comes to you, and they're suffering dreadfully because you know their mother has alzheimer's and they're unemployed well live in the moment</p>
<p t="5711430" d="4339">It's like that's just not helpful. It's it's and because it's even worse than that</p>
<p t="5715770" d="1510">It's judgmental you say well</p>
<p t="5717280" d="5989">the only reason you're suffering is because you haven't oriented yourself property to live in the moment like no you're suffering because your</p>
<p t="5723430" d="5180">Mother has alzheimer's and you don't have a job. It's like. It's not because you aren't living in the moment, so</p>
<p t="5729760" d="2839">Living in the moment isn't the right answer</p>
<p t="5733270" d="7070">The right answer is something more like orient yourself towards the highest good that you can imagine and then act in the moment</p>
<p t="5740340" d="4949">That's a whole different story now. That's what happens in the pinocchio story, basically what happens is that Geppetto?</p>
<p t="5745990" d="2419">sees the star beckoning in the distance</p>
<p t="5748410" d="6479">And he orient's himself towards the highest good he can imagine he wants to take this creation of his and so this is</p>
<p t="5756670" d="7759">Manifesting itself conceptually at multiple levels simultaneously because there's a there's a story about the destiny of humanity in relationship to God</p>
<p t="5764740" d="2239">Nested in the story. It's like take your</p>
<p t="5767770" d="2000">fallible creation your puppet and</p>
<p t="5773500" d="7640">Set [up] the pre. Set up the condition such that. It's capable of taking on full functional independence. It's something like that</p>
<p t="5781140" d="4350">So that's what you do if you're a good parent with your children. You don't protect them. You don't offer them safety</p>
<p t="5785770" d="4129">You don't do any of that except insofar as it's necessary to facilitate</p>
<p t="5790720" d="1410">their</p>
<p t="5792130" d="2000">Development as</p>
<p t="5794200" d="7189">Fully confident and courageous beings the purpose of the protection is only to allow that developmental process to to continue</p>
<p t="5801390" d="7979">So you you orient [Geppetto] orient's himself and so the farther orient's himself and then the son undertakes the voyage and so</p>
<p t="5810340" d="2030">[alright], so let's say that that's the case</p>
<p t="5814330" d="3919">you orient yourself first then you can start to rely on your</p>
<p t="5819040" d="4100">Then you can start to concentrate more on your orientation to the moment</p>
<p t="5824050" d="2000">now</p>
<p t="5826450" d="5569">I'm going to tell you another story. So you know I was just watching harry Potter the other day the first one and</p>
<p t="5832540" d="2000">I was watching the quidditch game</p>
<p t="5835570" d="4250">And the quidditch game is very interesting because there's a game and a meta game going on at the same time</p>
<p t="5839980" d="2629">So the game is just the standard quidditch game</p>
<p t="5842610" d="4950">It's kind of like basketball played on brooms right you have to throw balls through hoops and if you get enough points you win</p>
<p t="5847720" d="3319">But at the same time so there's the normal players</p>
<p t="5851040" d="5189">and then there's two seekers one from each team and the seekers aren't playing the same game the</p>
<p t="5858070" d="7070">Game is nested inside the seeker game actually because if you're a seeker, and you perform your task that everyone wins right you win</p>
<p t="5865170" d="3720">But everyone wins and so you're not even playing the normal game</p>
<p t="5869020" d="3560">You're playing the seeker game and the thing that that that</p>
<p t="5873070" d="5480">Harry Potter chases is this thing called the snitch and the snitch. This is one of the things that's I can't</p>
<p t="5878550" d="2849">I don't know how the hell Jk. Rowling figured this out</p>
<p t="5881400" d="6780">I cannot figure it out because that snitch is a winged ball right and there's there's actually a symbol of that winged Ball</p>
<p t="5888310" d="5689">Called the round Chaos which jung describes in his works on alchemy and his works on healthy are really really difficult</p>
<p t="5894000" d="5700">It's [not] [easy] to figure out what he's talking [about] at all, but the round Chaos which is a winged ball is</p>
<p t="5900460" d="7850">it's it's a manifest a of the spirit Mercury and Mercury is an emissary of the God, so you can think about mercury [uh] the</p>
<p t="5908890" d="5029">Unconscious manifesting itself in your in your field of experience something like that</p>
<p t="5914260" d="6500">In any case the the round Chaos is the container of the primordial</p>
<p t="5921160" d="3919">Material from which the world is made and I think about it like this</p>
<p t="5926080" d="2000">It's this thing</p>
<p t="5928930" d="2000">there, it's [that]</p>
<p t="5931719" d="3830">So when you encounter an anomaly an error?</p>
<p t="5936730" d="4700">It's a container. That's a way of conceptualizing it and what is it contained?</p>
<p t="5941530" d="6560">Well it contains in some sense it contains the whole world but but here's an example like look let's say</p>
<p t="5949930" d="4219">God let's say that you've had repeated fights with your wife about how</p>
<p t="5955000" d="3200">domestic duties are going to be arranged among around meal time and</p>
<p t="5958810" d="2239">you believe me you're going to have those fights and</p>
<p t="5961510" d="7220">So and so what's happening? Is that mealtimes are unpleasant because there's a war for power going on in the kitchen</p>
<p t="5969340" d="1830">right and</p>
<p t="5971170" d="2930">So then you think one day while you're going to you know?</p>
<p t="5975100" d="2000">note that and you're going to</p>
<p t="5978190" d="5629">Do an archeological investigation and find out just what the hell is going on and so you start?</p>
<p t="5985300" d="3140">unpacking the fact that mealtimes are not pleasant and</p>
<p t="5989140" d="4009">So what's in that little thing that you're unpacking that package well?</p>
<p t="5994330" d="5419">the entire power dynamic between men and women in the Modern world is inside [that] dispute and</p>
<p t="6001800" d="5450">you might find that part of the reason [that] your wife is upset about the way that mealtimes are arranged because is because</p>
<p t="6007650" d="2990">Her [grandmother] was beat by her grandfather</p>
<p t="6010640" d="7139">And that's playing a role in it played a role [in] determining her unconscious expectations</p>
<p t="6017780" d="3900">And that's pathologizing one of the day to day rituals in the house</p>
<p t="6021680" d="5369">and if you're going to unpack that you're going to have to unpack all of that into you take a</p>
<p t="6027510" d="2930">Little Monster, and you decompose it you find out it's a hydra</p>
<p t="6030440" d="5790">it's got 50 heads then you have to work through every single one of those it's really really difficult, so</p>
<p t="6036659" d="3620">It's a container that [contains] everything, but the thing is if you unpack it</p>
<p t="6040409" d="4160">Successfully let's say and you deal with it you go see eight a consensus</p>
<p t="6044880" d="4370">Then all of a sudden you get you get peace say around your mealtimes. Which is a major accomplishment</p>
<p t="6049380" d="2509">Man, because you have to eat three times a day</p>
<p t="6051889" d="4020">And it's the center of the household and all of them, so but the thing is is that</p>
<p t="6056969" d="1261">often</p>
<p t="6058230" d="3649">when you're especially in the context of an intimate relationship</p>
<p t="6062400" d="5810">Things will Emerge that produce discontinuities and the question is what should your attitude towards that discontinuity be?</p>
<p t="6068460" d="3379">Well you can punish the person for manifesting the discontinuity</p>
<p t="6071940" d="4969">That's the tyrannical aspect or you can let it take the whole thing apart and that will happen</p>
<p t="6076909" d="4260">I mean that's often how relationships end. Is that a discontinuity emerges and</p>
<p t="6082110" d="7549">People get into it and things go sideways so badly that the whole relationship descends into [Chaos] and people bail out of it</p>
<p t="6090300" d="3410">so it's no wonder that people want to ignore it and</p>
<p t="6094409" d="5120">It's also no wonder that. They want to tyrannize it. It's like quit bothering me with that well</p>
<p t="6102809" d="7910">Possibly, but probably not and also if my attitude towards you is quit bothering me with that your attitude towards me when I?</p>
<p t="6110719" d="5520">Have the same sort of problem in reverse. It's going to be exactly the same and so we're not going to get anywhere with it</p>
<p t="6117059" d="1560">All right</p>
<p t="6118619" d="2000">But that still is</p>
<p t="6121110" d="2180">painful now, let's go back to the</p>
<p t="6124230" d="2869">Quidditch issue now. Here's what happens is that?</p>
<p t="6129210" d="5719">harry Potter is picked to be the seeker so that means he is the seeker whatever he represents is the seeker [and]</p>
<p t="6136110" d="7160">He's an interesting character [because] he's touched by evil, and he's a rule breaker, and he's also kind of a normal kid</p>
<p t="6143270" d="3029">He's not [a] hyper intellect or anything like that. That's hermione's rule, right?</p>
<p t="6146730" d="5719">so he's normal but but super normal at the same time and he gets picked to be the seeker and and</p>
<p t="6152730" d="6229">Then you think about what is it he seeks, and he seeks this thing that glimmers rioted it flashes in front of him</p>
<p t="6158960" d="7500">It's made out of gold and it has wings and if he grabs it then he wins and so the question is</p>
<p t="6166800" d="1620">What does [that] represent?</p>
<p t="6168420" d="2330">Now it's interesting that when people watch that movie</p>
<p t="6170750" d="3209">They actually find that you know they think that that's kind of cool that it's a cool game</p>
<p t="6174600" d="1050">and</p>
<p t="6175650" d="3979">It is [a] cool game. She laid it out very nicely and the idea is that well</p>
<p t="6179630" d="2850">There's a game and if you play it normally you win the game</p>
<p t="6182670" d="3649">But in that game is a meta game and if you play that properly then not only do you win?</p>
<p t="6186320" d="6479">But everybody wins so then the next rule is the meta game supersedes the game and that's the same idea that</p>
<p t="6192800" d="2040">I'm chasing here with you today about this</p>
<p t="6195420" d="6500">Meta morality it's the it's the morality that emerges as a consequence of the analysis of a set of morality or it's the morality</p>
<p t="6202320" d="7310">It's the morality to which other all other morality should [be] subjugated that's another way of [thinking] about it, and [I] said well</p>
<p t="6209630" d="6330">That's a terrible thing because it involves painful sacrifice or maybe it involves confronting the thing you least want to confront</p>
<p t="6215960" d="3330">That's the union dictum right if your life, isn't all that</p>
<p t="6219290" d="6239">it should be then you should find out the thing that you least want to confront that you're avoiding and confront that and that's the</p>
<p t="6225530" d="5700">Easy to say but it's a terrible thing because it means you're going to have to turn your gaze [to] the place where you are</p>
<p t="6231330" d="3949">Weakest and most vulnerable that is asking a lot [of] people</p>
<p t="6235830" d="2629">so then you might say [well] is there an alternative and</p>
<p t="6239489" d="5180">I think there is an alternative, so this is the anomaly right this is the ball that contains everything</p>
<p t="6244670" d="4140">I think there is an alternative. I think it's associated with this idea, so</p>
<p t="6249330" d="2000">Imagine</p>
<p t="6251969" d="4040">Imagine we have a we could have a conflict if we were in a relationship</p>
<p t="6256010" d="3390">We could have a conflict that would blow the relationship apart all right</p>
<p t="6259400" d="3870">So we don't want to have that conflict and then we could have no conflict whatsoever</p>
<p t="6263640" d="4609">[which] means that you would never get to say what you wanted and I would never get to say what I wanted because</p>
<p t="6268949" d="961">We're either</p>
<p t="6269910" d="6770">Identical which is just not happening or we're going to have conflict because you're going to want some things that I don't want and vice-versa</p>
<p t="6276920" d="2250">So if there's no conflict, we are not in a relationship</p>
<p t="6279810" d="7489">[all] right, so zero conflict is the wrong amount and conflict it destroys the [relationship] is the wrong amount and then you might say well</p>
<p t="6288690" d="3020">Okay, what's the optimal amount of conflict?</p>
<p t="6292920" d="4100">Well, so so so then we can think about how people respond emotionally</p>
<p t="6297090" d="5430">So let's say if you go after the person that you're arguing with and you say you're a bad person</p>
<p t="6303310" d="4459">And you really make that case [you're] bloody well [hammered] home you remember 50 things they've done that</p>
<p t="6307770" d="2700">We're bad and you lay them out like I'm going to stomp you</p>
<p t="6310470" d="2729">You're a bad person you really need to change okay?</p>
<p t="6313200" d="2370">Well first of all you're going to meet tremendous resistance</p>
<p t="6315570" d="4679">And that's like you've got the hydrogen you bring in a hydrogen bomb to the war right and maybe</p>
<p t="6320500" d="5419">Unless you want to destroy everything maybe that's not the most logical solution, but then by the same token</p>
<p t="6326530" d="4459">Everything is [alright], and we never have any conflict that's not helpful either, and you're going to get bored of that</p>
<p t="6330990" d="5609">And you're not going to develop and so then the [question] is well. Maybe there's some happy medium here</p>
<p t="6337510" d="6739">Maybe you want to be repairing this structure. You know the structure that goes from micro actions up to higher-order?</p>
<p t="6345040" d="6140">Conceptualizations, maybe you want to be updating that on a constant basis, and you want to update it in a manner that doesn't</p>
<p t="6352120" d="3649">Drop you into Chaos or place you in too much spaces</p>
<p t="6355770" d="5459">And then that answer is well how then then the question is how is it that you can calibrate?</p>
<p t="6361780" d="6469">your approach to error so that you get the benefits of doing it without the disadvantage of collapsing into Chaos and</p>
<p t="6368710" d="3350">then the issue the answer to that is something like</p>
<p t="6375520" d="2000">it's something like</p>
<p t="6379000" d="2180">Once you have decided to adopt</p>
<p t="6382300" d="5329">Responsibility for being and will say that what that means is that you have</p>
<p t="6388660" d="1140">conceptualized</p>
<p t="6389800" d="1590">A</p>
<p t="6391390" d="6439">Good that you're willing to devote yourself to and I think you you're perfectly welcome to do that on an individual basis</p>
<p t="6397830" d="7770">[I] think you should do it on an individual basis. You should consult with your ancestors [while] you're doing that because generally speaking</p>
<p t="6406210" d="1860">the route to</p>
<p t="6408070" d="1440">optimal</p>
<p t="6409510" d="3709">the route to to quality of Life and productivity</p>
<p t="6413890" d="4009">Has been laid [out] by other people we kind of know what the parameters are</p>
<p t="6418150" d="2990">you need to do something that other people find is useful and</p>
<p t="6421780" d="3679">and and you have to regard it as useful as well or</p>
<p t="6426070" d="2959">At least you have to be entertaining there has to be something about you</p>
<p t="6429030" d="3389">Have value to other people that you have to pursue with a fair bit [of] diligence</p>
<p t="6434080" d="2689">So you have to play a productive social role?</p>
<p t="6438670" d="2000">probably need friends</p>
<p t="6441370" d="6979">Probably need an intimate relationship, and if it could be medium to long [term] in for an intimate relationship perhaps all the better</p>
<p t="6448350" d="5429">That's what most societies hold up as ideal could assume. Well. There's probably a reason for that</p>
<p t="6453780" d="4860">I think one of the reasons is is that your life gets fragmented otherwise Badly fragmented you know it's</p>
<p t="6458980" d="2299">Because every time you have a long term relationship</p>
<p t="6461860" d="7070">And it fragments. It's like your identity is blown into pieces you get fragmented across time it's it's not it's not good</p>
<p t="6469030" d="3920">It's it breaks you into pieces and you don't necessarily recover that well</p>
<p t="6474040" d="1800">It makes everything</p>
<p t="6475840" d="2000">much more in</p>
<p t="6478090" d="1590">permanent and</p>
<p t="6479680" d="5179">Unreliable all of those things so it it introduces a tremendous amount of uncertainty into your life</p>
<p t="6484860" d="2580">And it also means that you don't have anyone around that you can really trust</p>
<p t="6487440" d="4649">and that's bad because if you have someone around you can really trust and you have two brains instead of one and</p>
<p t="6492280" d="3860">Like you probably need two brains to manage your way through life. It's pretty complicated</p>
<p t="6499000" d="2359">So you orient yourself towards some good?</p>
<p t="6502120" d="2779">The highest good that you can conceptualize and it has to be</p>
<p t="6505690" d="5000">Through a consultation with your ancestors because you need to do the things that people have always done</p>
<p t="6510730" d="2149">[and] you need to do them properly and</p>
<p t="6512950" d="4129">You need to assume that that's the way that you should live unless you have a very good reason</p>
<p t="6517330" d="4100">To change it dramatically and maybe you do, but you got to start with some</p>
<p t="6522700" d="5689">Axiomatic set of presuppositions because otherwise you have to invent everything on your own, and you don't have enough time to do that</p>
<p t="6528390" d="5250">So you have to use normative guidelines and if you don't then people won't know what to do with you</p>
<p t="6533640" d="4500">That's another big problem. If you live completely outside the norm. I mean you know</p>
<p t="6538780" d="5990">Remarkable artists manage that to some degree, but of course they pay [for] the privilege by being remarkable artists</p>
<p t="6544770" d="6540">so if there's something truly remarkable about you perhaps you could justify deviating from the normative path, but if there isn't</p>
<p t="6552880" d="6680">First of all there's nothing remarkable enough about you to justify deviating in every way [from] the normative path no matter how remarkable you are</p>
<p t="6559930" d="1530">so</p>
<p t="6561460" d="5330">So that's part of the the rescuing of the father from from the depths is to</p>
<p t="6567460" d="4820">Reunite yourself with the structures of your community you can do that in a way that you feel</p>
<p t="6573370" d="7100">Suits your own needs best, but I don't think you cannot do it because it makes you weak, and then you'll drown</p>
<p t="6582220" d="2540">All right, so let's say you have oriented yourself</p>
<p t="6586150" d="2810">But not perfectly because you're full of mistakes and errors</p>
<p t="6589930" d="4669">So then what do you do because you have to fix those errors, but you still have to be oriented</p>
<p t="6596860" d="4010">And this is why I started getting to to get interested in the phenomena of meaning</p>
<p t="6601870" d="7520">As a phenomenological experience to experience something as meaningful, it's not exactly obvious what that means to experience something is meaningful</p>
<p t="6609390" d="3359">[I] think that you can you can approach it obliquely</p>
<p t="6612750" d="6000">You know like if I said watch yourself for two weeks and notice when you're doing something that you regard is meaningful</p>
<p t="6618750" d="2310">I could say well. Here's some here's some</p>
<p t="6621880" d="5630">Markers you lose a sense of time you lose a sense of vulnerability, you're deeply engaged in it it seems</p>
<p t="6627510" d="4559">It seems worth the effort right you forget yourself while you're doing [it]</p>
<p t="6632710" d="3169">Maybe you forget your existential concerns while you're doing it you're not</p>
<p t="6638020" d="7790">Ruminating or obsessing about the meaning of your life, right so so there's markers for it's like the flow states that [cSIkszentmihalyi] described</p>
<p t="6647860" d="2000">and</p>
<p t="6649870" d="4520">Then you can experience it you experience it under certain Sort of ritualistic conditions</p>
<p t="6654390" d="3810">You might experience it when you go see a great movie you might experience it when you listen [to] music</p>
<p t="6658200" d="5969">I think music is a very very standard pathway for people to have that kind of experience because</p>
<p t="6664600" d="5419">Virtually everyone gets intimations of mute of meaning from music and I think music</p>
<p t="6670600" d="1890">music is</p>
<p t="6672490" d="5959">Hierarchically structured patterns that are representative of being laying itself out properly</p>
<p t="6678450" d="4830">It's something like that, so it's an abstract representation of proper being and so</p>
<p t="6683800" d="5869">We can we can grapple with the phenomena of music and we can we can bach or phenomena of meaning we can box it in?</p>
<p t="6689670" d="2000">A little bit and start to conceptualize it</p>
<p t="6693760" d="6289">We can start to conceptualize it perhaps as the manifestation of a deep instinct, and so I would say well</p>
<p t="6700780" d="2329">Meaning is what NFS itself?</p>
<p t="6703870" d="2000">when you are</p>
<p t="6706750" d="2299">when you've oriented yourself properly and</p>
<p t="6709870" d="1470">when you've</p>
<p t="6711340" d="2000">optimized the</p>
<p t="6713710" d="2000">flow of information</p>
<p t="6716230" d="1500">between you and you</p>
<p t="6717730" d="5419">between you and Chaos that might be the right way of thinking about it because [literally] you think about a piece of music because you</p>
<p t="6723150" d="1420">Want it to be predictable?</p>
<p t="6724570" d="5270">but you don't want it to be perfectly predictable you want to be it to be predictable with some interesting variations and</p>
<p t="6730120" d="4459">Predictable with some variations that make sense. Maybe you can conceptualize that as something like this. It's like</p>
<p t="6735219" d="2000">it's predictable at this order of</p>
<p t="6738250" d="6979">Stability, but it's it's varying down here from time to time and so you've got stable stability there</p>
<p t="6745230" d="3540">But variability there and you can handle that so you want</p>
<p t="6749290" d="1350">an</p>
<p t="6750640" d="3049">overarching structure of stability with some internal variability and</p>
<p t="6754300" d="2900">Maybe that's the way that you update yourself without falling apart</p>
<p t="6757200" d="5129">and then I would say you can find the pathway to the optimal rate of</p>
<p t="6763360" d="4490">Update by relying on your sense of meaning. That's what it's for</p>
<p t="6768550" d="4729">what it tells you is that you're you're wandering your way through the world between the</p>
<p t="6774730" d="5270">Catastrophes of Chaos and the catastrophes of order and now and then you swing into the proper locale</p>
<p t="6780580" d="6169">You're where you should be and what happens is you get engaged by that you get meaningfully engaged by that and it's fragile</p>
<p t="6786820" d="3470">It'll move on you right because it's very difficult to exist at that</p>
<p t="6791020" d="1230">point</p>
<p t="6792250" d="3649">Constantly your bad habits all sorts of things your situation</p>
<p t="6795900" d="2069">There's all sorts of things that are going to interfere [with] that</p>
<p t="6797969" d="4860">But that doesn't mean that that isn't where you should be and so then you might say well</p>
<p t="6802830" d="4770">That's where you should strive to be all the time and then the question might be well</p>
<p t="6807600" d="5729">What would it be like if you [were] there all [the] [time], and I [think] that's where intimations of Paradise</p>
<p t="6814810" d="6799">Come from I mean when words think it was wordsworth talked about intimations of immortality and childhood people tend to romanticize</p>
<p t="6821890" d="2239">their childhood because of the sense of</p>
<p t="6824830" d="7699">Intense engagement that goes along with [being] a child and it's one of the wonderful things about being around children actually it's it's one</p>
<p t="6832530" d="4670">They pay you for their care and the way the children pay you for their care</p>
<p t="6837200" d="6690">Is that they turn normal things into Magic again when you're around them because you've seen it a hundred times before</p>
<p t="6844160" d="2130">And so when you see it, you don't see it</p>
<p t="6846290" d="1810">You see what you already know</p>
<p t="6848100" d="5359">But when a child sees it they don't because they don't know they see it and then when you watch them see it</p>
<p t="6853530" d="3140">You see it too, and so it's just tremendous fun</p>
<p t="6857340" d="5930">Leading a small child around to do things that you've done before because they're [sold] you know, they're like this</p>
<p t="6863340" d="5030">They're like all the time, and you know maybe that's too much and they cry and they get upset and all of that</p>
<p t="6868370" d="1380">but a good part of the time</p>
<p t="6869750" d="3390">It's just wild-eyed wonder and then you can see the world through their eyes</p>
<p t="6873140" d="7439">And it's payment, and so that's that sense of being engaged like that is something that people love about children and rightly</p>
<p t="6880580" d="2000">so, but it's also a marker to</p>
<p t="6882990" d="3709">the proper way of being you know there's a dictum in the</p>
<p t="6887190" d="5450">As a union idea that there's no difference between the archetype of the wise old man and the archetype of the child</p>
<p t="6892640" d="5849">They're the same thing because the wise old man is the person who found what he had in childhood, but lost</p>
<p t="6899130" d="7189">Right it said that's a very powerful motif is that the purpose of maturation is to return to the state of childhood as a mature?</p>
<p t="6906570" d="2510">Being not to stay in the state of childhood</p>
<p t="6909110" d="6180">That's peter pan, but to make the sacrifice is necessary for Maturation and then return</p>
<p t="6916080" d="4159">So well how do you do that? Well you do that in part by noting what it is</p>
<p t="6920240" d="6810">That's meaningful you for you to engage in I would say it's your nervous system reporting to you right hemisphere and left hemisphere</p>
<p t="6927480" d="5299">Balanced that the balance between Chaos and order produces an output that says you are [in] the right place</p>
<p t="6932850" d="6439">It's a perception the meaning is a perception of being in the right place. It's the genuine thing however</p>
<p t="6940110" d="2000">because it can be</p>
<p t="6942210" d="6290">Pathologized that's the thing and that's why I think there's a call to virtue in most great religious traditions if you're going to rely [on]</p>
<p t="6948500" d="6179">Your sense of meaning to orient you you have to play a straight game because otherwise you warp and twist</p>
<p t="6954900" d="6020">The inputs and then the mechanism won't function properly you [know]. It's like if you if you were only</p>
<p t="6961740" d="4400">if you're if you've blinded yourself to half the world you can't use your</p>
<p t="6966480" d="4849">Perception story and your self properly because the half the world that you're ignoring is going to pop up at you</p>
<p t="6971489" d="2570">unexpectedly and take you down, and so if your</p>
<p t="6974639" d="2000">Relationship with the world isn't pristine</p>
<p t="6977100" d="4639">Honest primarily, then you can't rely on your own internal orienting mechanisms</p>
<p t="6981739" d="3000">And then you either fall into Chaos which is an absolute catastrophe</p>
<p t="6984780" d="4700">Or you have to rely on some kind of external authority and that makes you prone to</p>
<p t="6990150" d="1380">Possession by Tyrannical</p>
<p t="6991530" d="5660">Ideologies for example which give you that sense of meaning that you should in fact have as a consequence of your own action</p>
<p t="7005719" d="4939">but okay, so if if all relationships are</p>
<p t="7012260" d="2000">our sort of</p>
<p t="7015010" d="2990">predicated on of this balance between</p>
<p t="7018640" d="2000">no, conflict and</p>
<p t="7020950" d="2000">conflict that destruct</p>
<p t="7024130" d="3830">[that] if we will look if we were to look at this at a more macro level</p>
<p t="7028989" d="1741">We see this</p>
<p t="7030730" d="1380">sort of</p>
<p t="7032110" d="6770">matte effect in in history in our world like with conflict in between countries in the two systems</p>
<p t="7039160" d="1590">Ideology EtC</p>
<p t="7040750" d="3649">But what is this sort of navigation between?</p>
<p t="7044920" d="7339">The exact line of no consequences [conflicts] how does that not imply that some people are inherently?</p>
<p t="7052780" d="1920">due to Chaos</p>
<p t="7054700" d="1470">It might</p>
<p t="7056170" d="3020">imply that you know what are the things so look so</p>
<p t="7062020" d="2000">sometimes</p>
<p t="7065200" d="2000">Sometimes you don't have an answer [that] works</p>
<p t="7068469" d="3410">you can answer that produces the highest probability of success and</p>
<p t="7072640" d="5060">Like I could view the archetypal world from a religious perspective and say that</p>
<p t="7078400" d="5419">There's such a thing as ultimate and final [redemption]. That's a metaphysical claim. I don't I don't want to do that</p>
<p t="7083820" d="5040">I think it's independent of what I'm talking about what I'm saying. Is that there's an archetypal path</p>
<p t="7088860" d="3240">That's laid out in in the mythology of the hero, and it's your best bet</p>
<p t="7092830" d="5929">That's all it's your best bet. It doesn't mean that if you apply it that everything is going to turn out</p>
<p t="7099820" d="3169">The way you might want it to turn out but but I would say this</p>
<p t="7103690" d="3080">There's a way of there's an interesting twist on that, too</p>
<p t="7106780" d="4340">this is one of the things that I came to understand about trying to speak the truth is that</p>
<p t="7112810" d="5629">You can make an assumption you can make a fundamental assumption based on your ignorance</p>
<p t="7118440" d="6600">Let's say and the in eradicable quality of your ignorance, but you can't compute the best possible outcome</p>
<p t="7125590" d="3229">What you can do instead is make a decision and one decision is well</p>
<p t="7128820" d="2000">I'm going to say what I think and see what happens and</p>
<p t="7131950" d="2719">Then you can define that as the best possible outcome</p>
<p t="7134950" d="3739">Now you might say well now and then that's going to lead you into Chaos. It's like yeah, it is</p>
<p t="7139390" d="2750">It is it's a strange. It's a strange inversion</p>
<p t="7144040" d="2390">But regardless of all doubt I would still say</p>
<p t="7147880" d="5270">Human beings are finite and limited and mortal you know and death is final. Let's say</p>
<p t="7153310" d="2600">I'm not saying that but we could easily say [that]</p>
<p t="7156700" d="2359">Doesn't matter this is still the best pathway forward</p>
<p t="7159970" d="2510">it isn't certainty there's no certainty and</p>
<p t="7163570" d="3290">It's very frequently in life you have poison a or poison B</p>
<p t="7166860" d="3840">Like you get to pick [your] poison [you] don't get to pick the elixir of life</p>
<p t="7170860" d="5090">but I would but I would say I would also say I don't think there's any reason to be particularly pessimistic because</p>
<p t="7176440" d="3260">We don't know what would happen if [people] really tried hard to get their acts together</p>
<p t="7179950" d="4279">Like if they understood the [necessity] of that and really put it forward I mean I</p>
<p t="7184780" d="5360">Mean I've had lots of experience with my clinical clients now. You know I've seen dozens and dozens of [people] and</p>
<p t="7190780" d="2000">We have tried jointly</p>
<p t="7192910" d="7459">To get their lives straighter, and it works almost inevitably now that doesn't mean I've had clients who died. You know we were</p>
<p t="7201070" d="1560">three-quarters through A</p>
<p t="7202630" d="7609">Wonderful process of psychological renovation and they got cancer and died so so there's there's no certainty associated with this</p>
<p t="7210820" d="2000">But it's the best</p>
<p t="7213880" d="2000">solution available [and]</p>
<p t="7216280" d="2689">And it's also possible that it's a good enough solution</p>
<p t="7220450" d="3919">Now I was talking to my class yesterday about this you know so you</p>
<p t="7224830" d="6379">If you pursue the things in [your] life that [are] meaningful once you've oriented yourself and that means accepting the challenges that come along with</p>
<p t="7231210" d="5100">That because one of the things that you'll find you even find this in music if you know a piece of music completely</p>
<p t="7236650" d="4520">Then you can not want to listen to it anymore this still has to be some challenge in it</p>
<p t="7241170" d="2669">You still have to track it and sometimes music is so complex</p>
<p t="7243840" d="4110">you just can't it just sounds like noise Modern music is often like that because it's so</p>
<p t="7248140" d="6799">Well it tends towards the chaotic and so it's I find it difficult to listen to because I can't get a handle on it</p>
<p t="7255040" d="4879">But then you know so it's too challenging, and then there's other music pop music is often like this</p>
<p t="7259920" d="3689">It's Catchy the first two times you hear it then you never want to hear it [again]. It's too much</p>
<p t="7263610" d="4950">There's too much predictability and not enough Chaos and hopefully you find a piece of [music]. That's somewhere in the middle</p>
<p t="7268560" d="3239">You can listen to it 50 or 100 times and each time you listen to it</p>
<p t="7271800" d="3930">There's still some new nuance in it that you didn't that you didn't</p>
<p t="7276040" d="4640">Expect before and so well you kind of want to set up your life like that, so that</p>
<p t="7281350" d="3319">And I think you see that the phenomena of meaning</p>
<p t="7285070" d="6020">manifests itself at the area at the Locale of Optimal challenge</p>
<p t="7291670" d="4010">So if the thing so one of the things for example, or might say well</p>
<p t="7295680" d="6059">Let's say you want to set some goals for yourself. [we] say well. They're remarkable goals, but they're all there to unattainable</p>
<p t="7302530" d="2390">You're just going to find it frustrating to pursue them</p>
<p t="7305620" d="4969">It's going to be too punishing, and then we might say well. Here's a goal, and you think well, I could do that</p>
<p t="7310590" d="3000">You know standing on my head. There's nothing in it</p>
<p t="7313630" d="4910">well both of those two extremes are going to leave you in a state that isn't characterized by the</p>
<p t="7318969" d="3680">Optimization of engagement and meaning one is too difficult [too] punishing</p>
<p t="7322680" d="5339">It's the judge and nothing else and the [other] is the ultimate and merciful mothers. It's like you win, no matter</p>
<p t="7328020" d="3899">How you play so then you calibrate and say well? You know [I] need?</p>
<p t="7332440" d="3080">I'm I'm up for a challenge at this level I</p>
<p t="7338199" d="4790">Wouldn't recommend that because that's just a bit like people do that you [want] it might want to</p>
<p t="7343719" d="2660">Investigate your character in detail and decide you know</p>
<p t="7346900" d="3919">What's going on at this level of analysis? That's pretty harsh, but you can certainly</p>
<p t="7351340" d="3379">continually retool yourself at more micro levels and</p>
<p t="7355390" d="4759">That and I think what you do is you pick the level of retooling that</p>
<p t="7361120" d="2629">optimizes your willingness to be engaged in it and</p>
<p t="7364300" d="5270">then what's so interesting about that is that I think is that you get the benefits of</p>
<p t="7370120" d="3199">perfection so to speak while still being imperfect</p>
<p t="7374230" d="3229">The imperfect your actual imperfection has nothing to do with it</p>
<p t="7378190" d="3589">what's relevant is the Jerk is the journey that you're undertaking to rectify the</p>
<p t="7382540" d="4699">imperfection so instead [of] aiming to be the entity without flaws</p>
<p t="7387550" d="5149">You're aiming to be the entity that continues to realize its flaws and overcome them. Well. That's a game</p>
<p t="7392699" d="4860">You can play forever and that's maybe the ultimate in being an unplowed entity</p>
<p t="7397560" d="5069">It's something like that so so I want to show you some pictures [that] I think are associated [with] that</p>
<p t="7404170" d="2000">so this one to begin with</p>
<p t="7406719" d="2630">This is an absolutely amazing picture. I think</p>
<p t="7409870" d="5209">so this is bert hold [firt] meier tree of life flanked by Eve and Mary Ecclesia and</p>
<p t="7415960" d="5059">This in some [sense] this this picture summarizes the biblical stories in one picture</p>
<p t="7421020" d="3450">which is that's pretty amazing that that a picture can do that and</p>
<p t="7424690" d="4939">So let me explain the picture a little bit so the first thing you see [here]. Is [that] this is the tree?</p>
<p t="7431020" d="2000">this is the tree of life and</p>
<p t="7434320" d="3919">So it echoes the tree of the [of] the knowledge of good and evil</p>
<p t="7439240" d="1520">But this is [post-fall]</p>
<p t="7440760" d="1060">so we</p>
<p t="7441820" d="2209">interpreted the story of Adam and Eve already</p>
<p t="7444030" d="5580">is that human beings became self conscious they discovered death they discovered morality it was all a consequence of</p>
<p t="7450160" d="5839">Interacting with the fruit and the snake something like that, and you can read that as an as an evolutionary tale</p>
<p t="7456670" d="2209">you can at least read it as a</p>
<p t="7459760" d="4549">Representation of the emergence of self-consciousness in human beings, so what does that mean well it [means] that?</p>
<p t="7464890" d="1110">the</p>
<p t="7466000" d="3350">[Apple] in some sense was equivalent to death, and that's what you see here</p>
<p t="7469350" d="2370">You see eve is picking fruit from the tree here</p>
<p t="7471940" d="6589">But the fruit is it's on the skull side of the tree and so eve. It's the vulnerability of Eve</p>
<p t="7478960" d="3829">She's naked there and displayed to the world. It's the vulnerability of Eve</p>
<p t="7482790" d="2820">That's one way of thinking about it was the vulnerability of Eve</p>
<p t="7485740" d="5689">That was the catalyst to the development of human self-consciousness, and I think that that's true</p>
<p t="7491500" d="4880">It seems to me to be a reasonable proposition and so</p>
<p t="7497080" d="1410">Eve</p>
<p t="7498490" d="2359">eve's relationship with the fruit and the snake</p>
<p t="7501850" d="4490">Doomed human beings to the realization of mortality that's what this side of the picture</p>
<p t="7507130" d="1830">represents and</p>
<p t="7508960" d="3589">So it's a catastrophe, and it's associated with here with the snake in the fruit</p>
<p t="7513610" d="4580">It's human beings attempts to understand how it is that they emerged into a self-conscious world?</p>
<p t="7518950" d="5270">Okay, so fine. So that's on this is on the the fall end of the story and this is on the</p>
<p t="7525190" d="5959">Solution end of the story now what you see here [in] there's a skull there, and there's a Crucifix here, and you see</p>
<p t="7531150" d="5310">There's all these little fruits on this tree, so it's the apple of death that eve is handing out on this side</p>
<p t="7536460" d="4409">and it's the host that plays a role [in] the cannibalistic right that's at the center of</p>
<p t="7541150" d="5939">Christian ritual that mary as the church is handing out as a medication for yes</p>
<p t="7547820" d="2000">So she's handing out the antidote</p>
<p t="7551060" d="5689">Well, what's the antidote well? It's a strange thing. It's associated with this Crucifix, and that's</p>
<p t="7557330" d="3080">Translated into this wheat and host so you're supposed to eat that and that</p>
<p t="7561500" d="6830">That is the incorporation of whatever this represents well the question, then is what does that represent it to assist?</p>
<p t="7568330" d="7560">It's a symbol of suffering obviously it's a symbol of the ultimate in suffering. It's the weirdest thing because the picture proposes that</p>
<p t="7576710" d="2869">to ingest the ultimate in suffering is to</p>
<p t="7581150" d="1440">simultaneously</p>
<p t="7582590" d="4189">Ingest the antidote to the catastrophe of the knowledge of death</p>
<p t="7587120" d="7550">It's a very strange paradox but but it's the it's the proper paradox. It's at the center of this of the great drama</p>
<p t="7594670" d="2000">that's represented by this picture a</p>
<p t="7599600" d="2990">Little knowledge of Death destroys you</p>
<p t="7604520" d="3110">Full voluntary acceptance of it is the [cure]</p>
<p t="7608600" d="2000">That's the idea</p>
<p t="7610640" d="2330">Well, that's a that's a hell of an [idea]</p>
<p t="7615620" d="3109">It's not only to and to accept it is</p>
<p t="7620210" d="3889">Simultaneously in some sense to take responsibility for it</p>
<p t="7625910" d="3560">Because you don't take responsibility for things that you don't accept</p>
<p t="7631310" d="7430">You only take responsibility [for] things that you do accept say well, the world is fundamentally flawed because it's fundamental nature is</p>
<p t="7640130" d="6049">Vulnerability Intolerable vulnerability, I'm not going to take any responsibility for that, but that's really [kane's]</p>
<p t="7646700" d="2000">attitude in the in the story of</p>
<p t="7649430" d="1830">cain and Abel</p>
<p t="7651260" d="3709">he externalizes responsibility for the catastrophe of his life and</p>
<p t="7655940" d="4669">Therefore he doesn't make the right sacrifices and so the paradoxical injunction here is</p>
<p t="7661730" d="2570">accept responsibility for the catastrophe of your life and</p>
<p t="7665510" d="2000">That way you transcend it</p>
<p t="7668060" d="6830">Simultaneously, and there's a there's an unbelievably hopeful message in there and the message is you're actually strong enough to do that</p>
<p t="7674890" d="4410">You just don't know it, and you won't find out till you do it. You can't find out till you do it</p>
<p t="7680139" d="3630">But if you did it you'd find out that it was true. It's a massive risk</p>
<p t="7683770" d="6689">It's the ultimate in risks right you have to be willing to lose your life in order to find it. It's like exactly right</p>
<p t="7690980" d="4909">So that picture when I started to understand that picture look every time I look at it. Just blows me away. I can't</p>
<p t="7697159" d="4880">Unbelievably, it's an unbelievably sophisticated set of ideas</p>
<p t="7703489" d="7850">But I don't think it's much different really [than] this idea. I mean buddha finds his enlightenment under a tree</p>
<p t="7712550" d="6109">It's not fluke that that's the case that's his natural [environment], and he's sitting in that lotus here the lotus [opens] up</p>
<p t="7718850" d="5869">[it's] [a] this thing that springs up from the depths. He sits there illuminated the same way. He's got a halo</p>
<p t="7724850" d="4009">that's the sun that stands for higher consciousness and he's</p>
<p t="7729590" d="4819">Transcended by accepting the fact that life is suffering he's transcended</p>
<p t="7735260" d="2330">the limitations that [are] part of mortality</p>
<p t="7739730" d="2000">You see that symbol there</p>
<p t="7742940" d="3949">That swastika you see it there. It's reversed the Nazis reversed it</p>
<p t="7748460" d="4850">Well think about that. I mean they weren't stupid as symbolism</p>
<p t="7753310" d="4259">They're symbols had meaning is what the swastika were represented was what this represents?</p>
<p t="7758330" d="2000">reversed</p>
<p t="7761600" d="2000">Well, that's a very bad idea</p>
<p t="7764179" d="5330">This is the thing that this this idea is what enables people to transcend their suffering and buddha said well</p>
<p t="7769510" d="3660">Don't don't be too attached to things and what does that mean?</p>
<p t="7773170" d="4500">It doesn't mean deny the world it might mean deny the world if you're too in love with the material</p>
<p t="7778250" d="2000">like with material well-being</p>
<p t="7780350" d="2029">Let's say then your pathway to</p>
<p t="7783230" d="7129">transcendence and meaning might be to Abandon that because it's [it's] constraining you it's making you less than you could be but the</p>
<p t="7790790" d="6349">Fundamental lesson the more fundamental lesson that's underneath that is don't let what you are stop you from being what you could be</p>
<p t="7798530" d="5240">Right and so then the [question] is well. What do you identify with do you identify with what you are?</p>
<p t="7805520" d="1830">then [your] tyrant</p>
<p t="7807350" d="4759">You identify with with Chaos because that's the opposite of order say</p>
<p t="7812970" d="2000">Then [you're] nihilistic</p>
<p t="7815220" d="4069">Well, you don't identify with either of those you know that they're both necessary</p>
<p t="7819290" d="3479">You know that you have to live with both of them, but you would you identify?</p>
<p t="7823470" d="5689">With the capacity to continually transcend what you are and then you seek out error</p>
<p t="7829710" d="3470">That's what humility is like. I'm error ridden</p>
<p t="7833700" d="6169">It's like so I want to see I want [to] put myself in the [situation] where I can discover one of my errors hopefully not</p>
<p t="7839870" d="5910">In [a] way that's going to knock me completely out of the game right. I want to I want to seek out a challenge</p>
<p t="7845780" d="3989">I want to find out where my limits are I want to find out where there's not enough of me yet</p>
<p t="7849770" d="5370">And I want to do that in a way that's engaging because you know you can wear yourself out fighting dragons</p>
<p t="7855240" d="6799">Obviously, you can exhaust yourself completely, and that's not helpful. You know [what] one of the things I learned for example when I was coaching</p>
<p t="7862710" d="1290">when I was coaching</p>
<p t="7864000" d="5780">Warriors who these were people who had very [high-end] careers and so they had an infinite workload no matter how much they worked?</p>
<p t="7869910" d="4399">Flat-out there was always way more work that they should do. It's very difficult thing to learn to manage and</p>
<p t="7875280" d="4909">So they were exhausting themselves, and I said well, you know you have to work less per day. It's like well</p>
<p t="7880230" d="3500">No, that's not happening. I can't do that and so</p>
<p t="7884670" d="1670">What I learned over time was [ok]</p>
<p t="7886340" d="5640">So this is what you have to do every three [months] you have to block off [4] days and go have a vacation [you] have</p>
<p t="7891980" d="4290">To plan that in advance, so it's in your calendar so that your secretary doesn't book your time</p>
<p t="7896270" d="5879">and then you need that because you have to recuperate enough so [that] you can work as hard as you're going to work and of</p>
<p t="7902150" d="1170">Course they were nervous about that</p>
<p t="7903320" d="2160">And I said well look we can we can calibrate this</p>
<p t="7905850" d="4339">Let's keep track of your billable hours over the next year and see if they increase or decrease</p>
<p t="7910260" d="5750">Because I bet you if you take more time off, you'll actually have more billable hours, you'll actually have your cake and eat it</p>
<p t="7916010" d="3449">too you'll get to have a vacation and you'll be more productive and</p>
<p t="7919980" d="2120">That inevitably that was what happened?</p>
<p t="7922100" d="5069">[and] so that's a matter of calibrating the game properly right you want to play [a] game that you can [play] today?</p>
<p t="7927170" d="3450">But also one that you can play next week and next month. We're not talking about</p>
<p t="7931200" d="2330">You know your your career this week?</p>
<p t="7933530" d="6779">We're talking [about] you having a career that lasts 30 years that doesn't kill you that doesn't make you hate yourself or the job that</p>
<p t="7940310" d="6120">Doesn't make you better that doesn't wear you to a frazzle so it has to be optimized and so I think that you can</p>
<p t="7946639" d="6720">Fact decide to take on the load that's optimally meaningful if you want and then you get to have your cake and eat it</p>
<p t="7953360" d="3839">Too you're on the pathway to continual incremental improvement</p>
<p t="7957199" d="4560">You only have to burn off a feather at a time instead of having the whole bloody thing burst into flames</p>
<p t="7962130" d="1250">But it's a constant</p>
<p t="7963380" d="6269">It's a constant source of renewal, and there's an idea that to be renewed you have to drink the water of life, [right]?</p>
<p t="7970320" d="3829">That's an old mythological idea and what's the water the water of life?</p>
<p t="7974550" d="5060">Chaos is water water water is Chaos water is what washes away too much order</p>
<p t="7979610" d="2969">And to stay continually let's say</p>
<p t="7984209" d="5630">refreshed by the water of life is to take on exactly the right [amount] of Chaos [to] make sure that your</p>
<p t="7990030" d="7399">Garden is properly nourished, and I think meaning is actually the marker of that and and as I said you know that</p>
<p t="7997429" d="4649">[I'm] not I wouldn't consider myself either naive or particularly optimistic person</p>
<p t="8002079" d="3209">I don't think I'm [either] of those, but this is an actually an idea</p>
<p t="8005389" d="4580">This is one of the only ideas that I've ever found that I really believed to be rock-solid</p>
<p t="8009969" d="1590">I actually think that it's true</p>
<p t="8011559" d="5939">And [it's] very optimistic because it says you can use your sense of meaning to calibrate your progress through life</p>
<p t="8018019" d="4370">It but there's rules you have to aim at the highest possible good that you can conceive</p>
<p t="8022699" d="2810">Now in that subject update because what the hell you know</p>
<p t="8025510" d="5609">but you start by aiming at the star you can see rather than the dimmer one that you can't yet perceive and</p>
<p t="8031369" d="4580">Then you decide that you're going to do that honestly right. There's that that's a big decision, so</p>
<p t="8036499" d="1160">the first decision</p>
<p t="8037659" d="2000">I think in some sense is a decision of love</p>
<p t="8039889" d="5600">You're going to decide that being is worthwhile, and that you're going to work [for] [its] betterment, and that's a decision</p>
<p t="8045489" d="3989">That's based on love and the second decision is based on truth having made that decision</p>
<p t="8049519" d="3680">You're going to play a straight game having made those two decisions</p>
<p t="8053199" d="2939">I think that you can allow your sense of meaning to calibrate your pathway</p>
<p t="8056139" d="5910">And then what's so interesting is [that] you hit a state that's as close to paradise unless you're going to hit</p>
<p t="8062389" d="2540">Right away, because being engaged like that</p>
<p t="8065090" d="5599">It's better to be engaged in the solution of a complex problem than not to have a problem at all</p>
<p t="8071749" d="7010">And that's that's no different than saying it's better for there to be being that non-being because being is a problem</p>
<p t="8080230" d="2129">and so if you want to have no problems</p>
<p t="8082360" d="1720">then you have no being and</p>
<p t="8084080" d="3199">You could say well being is so miserable that maybe that's the route</p>
<p t="8087280" d="3060">We should take and fair enough, but maybe you can have your cake and eat it, too</p>
<p t="8090520" d="3450">You can have the damn problem. It could be a problem</p>
<p t="8093970" d="6059">[we're] [solving] and you can be so engaged in solving the problem that it justifies the fact that the problem exists and</p>
<p t="8100130" d="2000">Then you get then you get to have</p>
<p t="8102470" d="5479">you get to have the problem and the solution at the same time and maybe that's better than not having the problem at all and</p>
<p t="8107950" d="3479">I [believe] that because one of the things I have seen and I've seen this so interesting</p>
<p t="8111710" d="2419">Being so interesting when I'd be lecturing to people especially</p>
<p t="8114680" d="4549">More recently and and this is also manifested on you itself on YouTube</p>
<p t="8119960" d="5359">I'm talking to people a lot about responsibility, and it's young men in particular that seem to be responding to that</p>
<p t="8125320" d="6479">And I [think] that's partly because I [think] that young women in some sense have their responsibility map already laid out for them</p>
<p t="8131840" d="6140">It's also less voluntary in some sense for women because they have more complicated problems to solve in the first part of their life</p>
<p t="8137980" d="6660">Right because they have to get the family problem solved but whatever I've been talking very in a very</p>
<p t="8145010" d="2000">delineate 'add Matter about</p>
<p t="8147410" d="2779">responsibility, which is a strange thing to sell to people but</p>
<p t="8151010" d="5120">Responsibility is what gives your life meaning and so then you might say well then take on ultimate responsibility</p>
<p t="8156710" d="6379">and what happens you have an ultimately meaningful life and then you might say well if your life is ultimately meaningful doesn't matter if it's</p>
<p t="8164239" d="3920">Punctuated by tragedy or even predicated on tragedy. It's worth it</p>
<p t="8169250" d="1710">and</p>
<p t="8170960" d="4040">I think that's true and everything I've seen indicates to me. That's true</p>
<p t="8175010" d="5630">Every time I get my clients to take on more [responsibilities]. You know it and it isn't an injunction</p>
<p t="8180640" d="5520">You're a bad person. You should take on responsibility have nothing to do with that you can define the damn responsibility</p>
<p t="8186160" d="2879">It isn't something that that someone else should impose on you</p>
<p t="8189040" d="4709">It's not a matter of doing what you [should] do in some abstract Manner. It's not that</p>
<p t="8194510" d="5120">It's the choice of what game you're going to play and you know you can play the game of the seeker?</p>
<p t="8199630" d="5910">I would say and if you play that game then everyone wins and it's the best game you can play and so the</p>
<p t="8206090" d="5150">The answer in some sense to the tragedy of life to the catastrophe of life to the fall is</p>
<p t="8211880" d="1170">to</p>

<p t="8283360" d="2000">What do you do about that?</p>
<p t="8286600" d="7009">you you voluntarily accept it and then strive to overcome the suffering that's a</p>

<p t="8344550" d="7050">[I'm] going to act as if I should pursue the deepest meaning possible in my life, [and] there's reasons to do none of those</p>
<p t="8352360" d="3290">They're real reasons. So it's really a decision</p>
<p t="8355930" d="4219">But you can't find out what the consequence of the decision is unless you make the decision</p>
<p t="8360150" d="2849">I think the same thing happens [when] you get [married] by the way, so</p>
<p t="8363610" d="3200">if you think you might leave you're not married and</p>
<p t="8367631" d="2329">Then you think well the marriage didn't succeed. It's like well</p>
<p t="8369960" d="6420">Maybe you were never married because the rule is you [don't] get to leave and there's a reason [for] that rule now</p>
<p t="8376381" d="3779">I'm not saying that there aren't situations where there should be exceptions made for that</p>
<p t="8380160" d="4830">that's not the point the point is that there's some games you don't get to play unless you're all-in and</p>
<p t="8386230" d="3349">The other thing that's so [interesting] about being alive is that you're [all-in]</p>
<p t="8391960" d="3650">No matter what you do you're all-in this is going to kill you</p>
<p t="8396730" d="3950">So I think you might as well play the most magnificent game. You can</p>
<p t="8401591" d="4519">While you're waiting because do you have anything better to do really?</p>
<p t="8407021" d="3229">Why not pick the best thing possible that you could do?</p>
<p t="8411280" d="4129">Why not do that maybe you could justify your wretched existence to yourself that way</p>
<p t="8415410" d="6330">I think [you] could that's what it looks like you know people find such meaning in the responsibilities</p>
<p t="8421740" d="5549">They adopt it stops making them ask questions about what life is for if you have a newborn child for example</p>
<p t="8428141" d="2750">Like unless you're really in a bad way</p>
<p t="8431650" d="5360">Psychotically depressed or maybe your personality really needs some retooling you stop thinking about</p>
<p t="8438940" d="3589">anything but ensuring that that baby is doing well and</p>
<p t="8443320" d="4400">If someone comes along and asks you an existential question about your commitment to that</p>
<p t="8447971" d="4580">the right response is why are you asking me such stupid questions when when</p>
<p t="8452920" d="5870">When this this is manifesting itself right in front of your eyes like how blind can you be that isn't a time for?</p>
<p t="8459131" d="5689">For questions about the meaning [of] life the answer is right in [front] of you, and if you can't see it</p>
<p t="8464820" d="5129">It's not because life has no meaning. It's because you're blind. I mean, that's what the image of</p>
<p t="8470891" d="4669">The virgin [mother] and the child is all about it's like what's the answer to the meaning of life?</p>
<p t="8476500" d="4400">Here's an answer. It's like well, I'm going to criticize that well go right ahead</p>
<p t="8481520" d="3530">You know it's like. It's like what you're like, a you like a</p>
<p t="8485630" d="2000">What do you call that a termite?</p>
<p t="8487880" d="2000">Going on a temple</p>
<p t="8489949" d="3470">there's no, there's no utility in that sort of criticism, you're</p>
<p t="8495590" d="4790">It's blindness and it's the same thing with regards to the path of the hero</p>
<p t="8500380" d="4229">It's like it glistens in front of you, and you can criticize it. It's like</p>
<p t="8506569" d="4760">fine put the cart before the horse and and see how far you get</p>
<p t="8514430" d="5150">So I thought to bring full closure to the class. I was trying to solve</p>
<p t="8520580" d="5089">this terrible puzzle that confronted me for and many other people about</p>
<p t="8526550" d="6410">How it was [that] human beings got themselves in such a tangle about what they believed such a tangle that we were pointing</p>
<p t="8533600" d="4400">The ultimate weapons of destruction at one another which by the way, we are still doing [I]</p>
<p t="8540739" d="4820">Thought okay. Well I understand that we need their belief systems they orient us and</p>
<p t="8546140" d="4070">That means there will be conflict between belief systems and that can be a catastrophe</p>
<p t="8550210" d="2819">And that's being played out everywhere again in very many ways</p>
<p t="8554300" d="4669">What's the solution to that well one possibility is there's no solution. It's just</p>
<p t="8559609" d="3080">Mayhem all the way around could be the case but</p>
<p t="8563270" d="4610">[it] seemed to me as I delved into it that the proper solution to that was to live properly as</p>
<p t="8568939" d="2959">An individual because you're more powerful than you think</p>
<p t="8572870" d="4399">Way more powerful than you think I mean God only knows what you are in the final analysis</p>
<p t="8578090" d="1979">You're blind to your own</p>
<p t="8580069" d="5030">Weaknesses, but you're also blind to your own strengths and so then I think well if you've got your act together</p>
<p t="8585100" d="3629">It'd be better for you, and instantly it would be better for your family assuming</p>
<p t="8588729" d="5160">They wanted you to get your act together and not everyone does but and then it would be better for the community</p>
<p t="8593890" d="6179">It's like how far could you take that if you stopped wasting time and if you [stopped] lying and if you oriented yourself to to</p>
<p t="8600069" d="4950">The highest possible good that you could conceive of and you committed to that how much good could you do?</p>
<p t="8606199" d="2450">Well, I would say might find out</p>
<p t="8612739" d="2060">So that's what I think you should do</p>
<p t="8615470" d="1320">You should find out</p>
<p t="8616790" d="5239">You don't have anything better to do and there's nothing in it as far as I've been able to tell there's nothing in it</p>
<p t="8622029" d="2000">But good</p>
<p t="8625159" d="1830">so</p>
<p t="8626989" d="4310">Maybe you could sort yourself out. So that you wanted nothing, but the good and</p>
<p t="8632479" d="3320">and then maybe you could help make that manifest in the world and</p>
<p t="8636859" d="6709">maybe we wouldn't have all these terrible problems then at least we'd have fewer of them, and that would be a start, so</p>
<p t="8645140" d="3379">It's it's that the answer to the problem of humanity</p>
<p t="8648520" d="4679">Is that is the is the integrity of the individual?</p>
<p t="8654260" d="2000">That's the answer</p>
<p t="8656899" d="4310">so and states that are predicated on that realization are healthy, so</p>
<p t="8662869" d="5690">[in] states that aren't are doomed to stagnation and catastrophic collapse and</p>
<p t="8670670" d="2000">personalities that are predicated on</p>
<p t="8674239" d="2780">self Tyranny and the Tyranny of others are doomed and</p>
<p t="8678859" d="2000">doomed to collapse</p>
<p t="8681680" d="5689">[so] and then you think well, what's the barrier the barriers are you willing to accept the responsibility and</p>
<p t="8688159" d="2480">Part of the answer to that is reduce the Dam</p>
<p t="8691040" d="6139">Responsibility until it's tolerable you don't have to fix everything at once you could just start by fixing the things that you could fix</p>
<p t="8698270" d="2000">Or you could even do it more?</p>
<p t="8703220" d="4490">You can do it with even less self-sacrifice. You could start by fixing only the things that you want to fix</p>
<p t="8708439" d="2060">God you can get a massive way that way</p>
<p t="8711109" d="5900">So do it see what happens that's what you should have been talking university right from the beginning</p>
<p t="8717229" d="6889">[it's] like a mathias good tool yourself into something [that] can attain it and go out there and manifest it in the world</p>
<p t="8724670" d="2989">And everything that everything that comes your way will be</p>
<p t="8730640" d="2839">Everything that comes your way will be a blessing and so</p>
<p t="8735800" d="4759">All you have to do is give up your resentment and your hatred I know that's a hard thing to give up</p>
<p t="8740899" d="2000">Because you have plenty of reason [for] it</p>
<p t="8745819" d="3530">That's probably a good place to stop so to the pleasure</p>
