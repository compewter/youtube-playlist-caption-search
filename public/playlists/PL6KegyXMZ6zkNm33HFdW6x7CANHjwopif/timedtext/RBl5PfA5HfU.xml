<p t="16030" d="4440">A short while ago. I had the honor of talking with ayaan Hirsi Ali</p>
<p t="21110" d="7610">Who I regard as a genuine modern-day heroine and a role model for all individuals who desire to speak and embody the truth?</p>
<p t="29210" d="3620">I'll tell you a little bit about her before the discussion starts</p>

<p t="86630" d="5180">indirectly to the fall of the second Balkenende cabinet in that in 2006 a</p>
<p t="92659" d="4819">former devout Muslim Hirsi Ali left the faith and became a vocal critic of Islam</p>
<p t="98060" d="7309">particularly in its radical forms she collaborated on a short movie with Theo van Gogh in 2004 entitled submission</p>
<p t="106039" d="7400">The film depicted the oppression of women under fundamentalist Islamic law sparking controversy and threats of death</p>
<p t="113930" d="7369">van Gogh was in fact stabbed to death by Muhammadu Buhari a Moroccan Dutch Islamic terrorist later that year</p>
<p t="122270" d="5389">Hirsi ali maintains that quote Islam is part religion and part a political military</p>
<p t="127789" d="1771">doctrine the part that is a</p>
<p t="129560" d="6470">Political doctrine contains a worldview a system of laws and a moral code that is totally incompatible with our</p>
<p t="136370" d="2180">Constitution our laws and our way of life</p>

<p t="172980" d="4610">Her critics accuse Ali of building her career on the denigration of Islam and Muslims</p>
<p t="177930" d="7730">Questioning her right to speak authoritative Lee about Islam, and the Arab world and portraying her as the embodiment of the Western colonial</p>
<p t="186270" d="2000">civilizing mission discourse I</p>
<p t="189780" d="4910">Guess you'll be able to render judgment on that yourself after watching our discussion</p>
<p t="197910" d="2059">The first thing I'd like to say is</p>
<p t="200640" d="4099">Thank you very much for agreeing to do this video. I'm very happy to be talking to you</p>
<p t="204740" d="2000">I've been nervous about it all day actually</p>
<p t="207240" d="1980">Oh please don't be nervous</p>
<p t="209220" d="2760">Anything new she tells me to do.</p>
<p t="212000" d="3780">I see I see, okay, okay, so well</p>
<p t="215920" d="3800">I sent you some questions the other day and</p>
<p t="219840" d="3580">I thought that I would first of all ask you</p>
<p t="224760" d="5680">I read your recent paper the one that you wrote for the Hoover Institute called the challenge of Dawa</p>
<p t="231440" d="3660">And so I thought maybe I'd ask you if you would to begin with just to tell people</p>
<p t="235320" d="5119">If you could give them a brief summary of what you were attempting to accomplish with that that might be a good way to start</p>
<p t="241470" d="4339">So what I was trying to accomplish was to get the attention of</p>
<p t="246600" d="2389">our society especially the government</p>
<p t="249690" d="7039">To the ideology that underlying is the outbursts of terrorism the misogyny against women</p>
<p t="257430" d="4250">homophobia this demand by Islamists who wants to kill and eliminate all homosexuals</p>
<p t="262710" d="1400">The outburst again</p>
<p t="264110" d="3750">of the increase in anti-semitism the persecution of Christians</p>
<p t="268320" d="4669">trying to kill people like me who are apostates who are ex-Muslims and</p>
<p t="273450" d="6199">Draw attention to the venues where these ideas are disseminated these are in schools</p>
<p t="279930" d="2929">It's in the mosque. It's in the madrasa It's in the neighborhood</p>
<p t="283900" d="2989">And it is authorities, you know, imam's</p>
<p t="287919" d="1310">sometimes its Parents</p>
<p t="289229" d="6540">These professionals who say that they are theologians who are telling young people as young as</p>
<p t="296199" d="1891">kindergarten age</p>
<p t="298090" d="5929">how to hate and what to hate and once we understand Dawa once we understand</p>
<p t="304560" d="4340">This commitment to get into the heads and hearts of</p>
<p t="309300" d="5500">People the ideas of radical Islam, then I think that we will be able to deal</p>
<p t="315880" d="3900">Better with the terrorism and symptoms which are the outcomes of it</p>
<p t="320820" d="5980">Dawa is the call to radical Islam. Jihad is an extension of Dawa</p>
<p t="327580" d="3260">that's what I'd like to say Jihad is an extension of Dawa</p>
<p t="331260" d="6180">and for me jihad constitutes the violence the terrorist acts and the political violence thats used to make</p>
<p t="337540" d="2460">that's intended to change</p>
<p t="340000" d="6000">Society but will never be able to eliminate Jihad unless we eliminate Dawa</p>
<p t="347640" d="4739">Okay, so, and what exactly would you say is the relationship between, Dawa</p>
<p t="352379" d="2000">And and jihad, you're formulating it</p>
<p t="354699" d="5899">By the sounds of it that Dawa is the precursor to jihad and are the concepts reasonably separable</p>
<p t="360599" d="4470">And and I guess a subsidiary question of that would be we're talking about radical Islam</p>
<p t="365069" d="4890">But of course many of the people who are watching are going to be, it's going to be difficult for them to</p>
<p t="370120" d="2719">distinguish between moderate Islam and radical Islam</p>
<p t="372839" d="6030">And I'm also curious about your feelings about exactly that distinction and how such a thing might be pursued</p>
<p t="380520" d="6920">So my approach to it is there is one Islam, but there are three sets of Muslims. There is one Islam</p>
<p t="387460" d="3280">That is unreformed and that one Islam</p>
<p t="391240" d="2900">Consists of different components it has a religious component</p>
<p t="394240" d="5329">It has a political component, a social component, but it's all-encompassing</p>
<p t="400240" d="6889">Now if you look at the different sets of Muslims what you see is one set of Muslims who just adhere to the religious</p>
<p t="407380" d="6580">prescriptions, and they see being a Muslim as something private and when they're confronted by others about</p>
<p t="415460" d="7060">The political activists or the bad things that other Muslims do - they invoke the Quran. They invoke the Prophet Muhammad</p>
<p t="422520" d="4769">He's the founder of Islam by mentioning on his life in Mecca</p>
<p t="427570" d="7400">these are the early days when he first started with religion in he is fight persuade people to come to his God and leave theirs and</p>
<p t="435220" d="2000">using along (war and power?)</p>
<p t="438190" d="5149">But then there's that other set of Muslims. I call them the medina Muslims</p>
<p t="443650" d="4010">They're the ones who are waging Jihad they are the ones who are engaged in Dawa</p>
<p t="447870" d="4949">They're the ones who have the objective of subduing the entire world to Islam</p>
<p t="453430" d="6769">They are the ones who hate homosexuals to hate women and who hate non-muslims and to say that it's their</p>
<p t="460600" d="1620">duty to</p>
<p t="462220" d="2149">Die converting people to Islam</p>
<p t="464370" d="2070">I call them the medina Muslims</p>
<p t="466840" d="6440">because they invoke the Prophet Muhammad's life and example and legacy in Medina and</p>
<p t="473620" d="2000">then there's a third group</p>
<p t="476170" d="2270">I call them them the modifiers or the reformers</p>
<p t="479050" d="3050">These are Muslims who are standing up to the medina Muslims</p>
<p t="482380" d="7490">Who are saying within Islam as a civilization, as a culture, as a religion, as a political philosophy?</p>
<p t="489870" d="4470">We have a theological problem, and we have to deal with that theological problem</p>
<p t="495130" d="3320">So this for me these are the three different sets of Muslims</p>
<p t="499090" d="7459">The problem are the medina Muslims they are the ones who are engaged in Dawa. Now we want to differentiate between Dawa and jihad</p>
<p t="506920" d="5269">For the medina Muslims, the Islamists will tell you is, well we first start with Dawa</p>
<p t="512190" d="3510">We call you to Islam, and if you reject it</p>
<p t="515700" d="6860">Then you are an enemy of Islam and the fact that they use violence is your fault you are to blame for it because</p>
<p t="522560" d="2540">in their reasoning which is secular</p>
<p t="525100" d="6139">They are not going to try and convince you with good argument on why Sharia or Islamic law is good for you</p>
<p t="531240" d="2580">good for women, good for non-muslims</p>
<p t="534720" d="5480">Good for gays they are not going to try and bother doing that. They are going to tell you, this is what is in the Quran?</p>
<p t="540200" d="2000">This is what Muhammad said</p>
<p t="542220" d="2040">I am informing</p>
<p t="544300" d="7560">And if you refuse, and this is steps to inform to persuade to call you to invite you,</p>
<p t="551960" d="4240">then they apply force and that force, the application of force, that is Jihad.</p>
<p t="556220" d="5820">But Jihad really, for Medina Muslims means, it's a holy-war against non-muslims</p>
<p t="562040" d="3540">it is to convince non-muslims, convert or die.</p>
<p t="567760" d="3560">There is this other status of purgatory</p>
<p t="571600" d="3340">you know where you have to pay discriminatory taxes</p>
<p t="575120" d="5640">And we lead a life of second-class, third-class citizens if you will. Look at the Christians who live in Egypt</p>
<p t="581140" d="4640">Christians who live in Pakistan Christians who live in other Muslim majority countries it's that kind of status.</p>
<p t="586360" d="2000">So the Mecca / Medina</p>
<p t="588580" d="6180">Distinction seems to be very, I would say both complicated and problematic because so</p>
<p t="595100" d="3640">So tell me if I'm wrong ok because my understanding is that?</p>
<p t="600400" d="5900">Mohammed spent most of the part of his life that was associated with the establishment of Islam in</p>
<p t="606460" d="7760">Medina and not in Mecca and that it wasn't until he went to Medina that Islam actually became a force so back in Mecca</p>
<p t="614740" d="3380">Although his doctrine appears to have been let's say more peaceful</p>
<p t="618220" d="4700">It was also much less successful as a, as a both a religious and a political movement</p>
<p t="623170" d="5390">So then he left Mecca and I believe under pressure from the inhabitants at least to some degree</p>
<p t="628870" d="3649">Moved to Medina and then that's when Islam became more</p>
<p t="633100" d="1680">more rep more</p>
<p t="634780" d="6049">Revolutionary and expansive, and so what do you see, now I know that it isn't</p>
<p t="641410" d="3770">universally accepted among the Islamic community that that Mecca / Medina</p>
<p t="645490" d="7579">distinction is a reasonable one to make because of course the presumption is that there's an essential unity of thought across the doctrines, but</p>
<p t="654100" d="6229">But given given your interpretation, and I've read the similar interpretation among other among other people</p>
<p t="661120" d="7699">Do you see, what you see as hopeful within the Islamic community with regards to bridging the gap between the, say the earlier</p>
<p t="669220" d="3830">works so to speak of Muhammad and the later, the later more</p>
<p t="673810" d="4819">Revolutionary element of the, of his actions and his faith. Is there a way that that can be reconciled</p>
<p t="679870" d="6799">Well, so dividing Muslims into make a set of Mecca set of Medina and modifiers</p>
<p t="686800" d="2179">That's not of course an official</p>
<p t="690360" d="4360">Distinction it's not accepted anywhere. You really want to get to you-know-who</p>
<p t="695180" d="2000">Which individuals, which Muslims</p>
<p t="697720" d="4550">Are at war with us and should we be worried about, what about the vast majority of</p>
<p t="702790" d="4760">Peaceful Muslims, what about these other Muslims who are speaking up, you know, what kind of labels</p>
<p t="707550" d="5520">Do you want to give them? If you study the works of the Islamists what you will notice</p>
<p t="713070" d="7440">I was raised as a Muslim what I think that was the first thing that I noticed is that they're selective, and in their selections</p>
<p t="720900" d="4920">who justify their actions, they rarely invoke Mecca</p>
<p t="726360" d="1320">Or Mohammad's legacy in Mecca</p>
<p t="727690" d="6649">Because as a Muslim if my sister tells me ";Ayaan, you've missed a prayer you need to get up an pray";</p>
<p t="734560" d="2929">Won't involve some verse for Mecca and say oh come on</p>
<p t="738250" d="3320">My relationship with Allah is intimate and unique</p>
<p t="741570" d="2279">It's none of your business to tell them what to do</p>
<p t="743850" d="4320">And then she would come up with some other Haddith or some other verse, saying well</p>
<p t="748170" d="4739">But it's might duty to command right and forbid flaw and on and on it goes</p>
<p t="752910" d="6900">So this is the within a Muslim family, but then the Medina Muslims, they extend (???), so it did strike me</p>
<p t="759810" d="4670">And I'm not the only one the other scholars like Muhammad (???) there are many other scholars</p>
<p t="764660" d="6220">Who are Muslim, who believe that they must see a way of preserving Islam</p>
<p t="772680" d="7140">As a tradition, as a culture, as a civilization and at the same time putting to bed this violent</p>
<p t="780730" d="3679">Human rights? violating concepts within Islam</p>
<p t="784409" d="5971">If you try and do that then you're going to see, you're going to make a list of all</p>
<p t="790720" d="2720">The concepts</p>
<p t="794290" d="5929">The derees that we really don't have any problem with, like people being told to pray five times a day or</p>
<p t="800500" d="5719">visit Mecca or fast in the month of Ramadan and all sorts of, you know, religious rituals</p>
<p t="806220" d="3869">I really don't have a problem with that and when I look at where all of that's concentrated</p>
<p t="810209" d="7450">That's in Mecca, it's in the early days. In Medina, as you said, then it turned into a political philosophy, it becomes a military creed</p>
<p t="818030" d="6409">Mohammed wages wars, he leads them, he elects others to lead and that's exactly when Islam becomes</p>
<p t="825290" d="5210">Successful and Islamists of today are trying to, they're trying to emulate that power</p>
<p t="830500" d="5520">And then say so explicitly, they write it 
 and they are proud to be</p>
<p t="837110" d="3980">You know to be emulating Mohammed in this way, so that's I think</p>
<p t="841610" d="5390">When you say, you know, the Mecca / Medina is problematic. I think any kind of</p>
<p t="848480" d="4190">Classification that we apply in social sciences has its problems</p>
<p t="852670" d="5070">But one sort of simplifies because it focuses our attention where it should be</p>
<p t="860030" d="2179">Okay, so you see this as an externally applied</p>
<p t="865220" d="8620">Category system essentially, that's useful. That's useful for, outsiders who are trying to assess the situation</p>
<p t="873880" d="6560">To determine who it is that you're dealing with that might be regarded as an ally and who it is that you're dealing with that might</p>
<p t="880450" d="3690">Be regarded as a foe so to speak and that would be on the more militant end of things</p>
<p t="884930" d="2330">That's a reasonable way of looking at it?</p>
<p t="888320" d="7130">That's reasonable. That's a reasonable way of looking at it, but also if you take the moderate versus extreme classification or categorization</p>
<p t="896030" d="2000">That has become commonplace</p>
<p t="898580" d="6019">It doesn't tell you when we look at moderate we think of people who are not using violence</p>
<p t="905270" d="2989">Whereas if you look at Medina you will see that there are</p>
<p t="909590" d="2000">hundreds of thousands of Muslims</p>
<p t="911810" d="2210">Who do not apply violence now</p>
<p t="914210" d="6559">But who do preach violence and they do preach the Medina legacy and they believe that Sharia should be</p>
<p t="921080" d="6349">Instituted and in places where they get, where you get a majority of these non-violent Medina types</p>
<p t="927440" d="5200">then suddenly they start applying and enforcing sharia law.</p>
<p t="932640" d="4080">So I think in the terms moderate and extreme are just not good enough</p>
<p t="936720" d="1300">They don't cover the...</p>
<p t="938060" d="7640">Right well and they also don't they don't also seem to bear any relationship to the internal dynamics of the faith itself so that that's also problematic</p>
<p t="946060" d="2000">okay, so</p>
<p t="949310" d="6090">You have to keep going back to the theology have to keep going back to the internal debates among Muslims</p>
<p t="955400" d="3989">on how to move, how to move on and how to relate to the rest of the world.</p>
<p t="959600" d="7700">So I personally think Mecca and Medina is much more useful as a tool, as an external conceptual framework for understanding the</p>
<p t="967400" d="7360">Problem we face with Islam, then extreme versus moderates and all the 
other, you know, all the other terms that we have</p>
<p t="975180" d="6400">Okay, so let me ask you another question about that then so, see one of the problems that I've had because I've been trying to look at</p>
<p t="983190" d="7700">The potential for a true relationship between Islam and Christianity you know to the degree that I understand Islam or Christianity which of course</p>
<p t="991280" d="5520">There's plenty to understand about both, so it's no easy thing to manage, but there is this claim as well that</p>
<p t="997400" d="7840">that's widespread and rather vague that that Islam is in essence a religion of peace and but when I look at the</p>
<p t="1005240" d="2320">historical data say stemming from the Medina</p>
<p t="1008120" d="6320">The Medina time and then moving forward and the fact that Mohammad was definitely someone who engaged</p>
<p t="1014600" d="3260">personally in warfare and in an expansionist warfare</p>
<p t="1017860" d="5309">It's not an easy thing for me to make the leap to to</p>
<p t="1024020" d="5060">Comprehending or being able to accept the claim that the fundamental doctrines of Islam are peaceful</p>
<p t="1029860" d="5840">Or are associated with peace because it looks to me like there's an element of it. That's quite militaristic, and I've also thought that</p>
<p t="1036319" d="6020">Let's say, there's a religious element to Islam, and I mean this is not an original thought obviously, there's a religious element Islam</p>
<p t="1042339" d="5400">But there's also something that's clearly more like a political movement and more like a governmental movement</p>
<p t="1047740" d="1180">And that's also</p>
<p t="1048920" d="6500">Complicated by the fact that there isn't any clear separation between church and state in Islamic doctrine as far as I can tell so</p>
<p t="1055640" d="5440">When we hear claims that, or when claims are made that Islam is essentially a religion of peace</p>
<p t="1061340" d="3780">Then that doesn't seem to be the case with the Medina end</p>
<p t="1065180" d="7520">Of the theological discourse or the actions that emerge thereof and then part of the problem is how do you reconcile that with the</p>
<p t="1072980" d="5180">Contradictions in relationship to the earlier as you say Meccan doctrines</p>
<p t="1078160" d="2780">And it isn't clear to me how that can be done so...</p>
<p t="1080980" d="8240">Medina muslims see Islam as a political creed that the believers should enforce, are obligated to enforce so number one they argue</p>
<p t="1089580" d="5729">In that conditions they fight, that Muhammad in Mecca did not give the Meccans a choice</p>
<p t="1095309" d="2671">He didn't say oh you can have your gods like</p>
<p t="1098060" d="5680">and you know, I have my God. His message was you guys are worshiping false Gods</p>
<p t="1103980" d="4980">These are idols, you live in a time of ignorance, and I have come as a last messenger</p>
<p t="1109060" d="2140">To convey to you</p>
<p t="1111360" d="2140">you know, the light</p>
<p t="1113650" d="2000">and enlightenment and come with me</p>
<p t="1116160" d="5700">Now what is peaceful in his actions in Mecca, it's not the message that is peaceful</p>
<p t="1122080" d="4720">it's the fact that he didn't apply force, he didn't put together a militia and</p>
<p t="1127020" d="5480">Attack the Meccans that which he described as a polytheists and unbelievers</p>
<p t="1133059" d="2540">in Medina he does that.</p>
<p t="1136320" d="3840">As in Medina, as he wins war after war</p>
<p t="1141660" d="4240">The numbers of Muslims increase, and these are people who come to [be] Muslim by force</p>
<p t="1146500" d="3640">Then he says everywhere where people accept Islam</p>
<p t="1150460" d="8000">That is peaceful. So the definition of peace in Islam is only after you accept Islam as long as you refuse to</p>
<p t="1158680" d="3540">abide by Islamic law or</p>
<p t="1162640" d="3139">Accept to be subdued by Islam, you are at war</p>
<p t="1165779" d="4500">That's why they the Medinans make this distinction between the house of Islam, feasts</p>
<p t="1170279" d="4590">And the house of war, (right) and the house of war is everywhere where there are infidels</p>
<p t="1174909" d="4280">And it's the job of the Muslims in the house of peace to convert them</p>
<p t="1179189" d="6331">So it's a religion of peace insofar as its final utopian aim is the cessation of conflict?</p>
<p t="1185520" d="4660">but it's the cessation of conflict in part as a consequence of conquest</p>
<p t="1190240" d="980">Absolutely</p>
<p t="1191260" d="1140">Ok yeah, yeah</p>
<p t="1192400" d="2020">Well that was more or less how I understood it so</p>
<p t="1194740" d="3469">When the claim is made that it's a religion of peace, then that isn't precisely</p>
<p t="1199020" d="4360">It's it's a sleight of hand in some sense with regard specifically to that phrase</p>
<p t="1203760" d="4380">There are individuals, [the] ones I described as Mecca who are saying</p>
<p t="1208860" d="5020">When they say Islam is peace what they really want to say is, I am a peaceful individual</p>
<p t="1213899" d="2250">And I have no problems with other religions and</p>
<p t="1216300" d="7460">I do not want to be engaged in any politics of any sort or to link politics with religion, please leave me alone</p>
<p t="1223760" d="3440">Right right right and that I would say would be the majority of Muslims worldwide</p>
<p t="1227380" d="1670">I'm not sure you agree with that</p>
<p t="1229050" d="1890">But it seems to me that it isn't</p>
<p t="1230940" d="6920">Self-evidently the case that the majority of human beings are violent and warlike and so my sense is is that</p>
<p t="1238140" d="2000">given the essential peace</p>
<p t="1240340" d="5449">peacefulness of most people they're going to take a look at the Islamic doctrine and extract from it those elements that are</p>
<p t="1246190" d="4219">Supportive of that more individual peace, but that still leaves open the question of exactly</p>
<p t="1250930" d="2329">What the doctrine means as a set of</p>
<p t="1253390" d="4369">motivational principles and that seems to be a big part of the current problem and also the need for</p>
<p t="1258250" d="5960">Current discourse what I would hope is that it would be possible to undertake a dialogue with Islam</p>
<p t="1264210" d="1290">Let's say between Islam</p>
<p t="1265500" d="1480">and the West or between Islam and</p>
<p t="1266980" d="7880">judeo-christianity and to find within Islam itself the seeds that would enable that dialogue to occur so that some sort of long-term</p>
<p t="1275040" d="6020">Negotiated conceptual and practical peace could be attained, but the more I've read about Islam the more difficult</p>
<p t="1281070" d="3809">It is for me to understand how that might be managed especially because of its</p>
<p t="1285060" d="7180">well, because of the warlike tradition that emerged from Medina and then moved outward at a staggering rate from that</p>
<p t="1292240" d="4220">and also the thing that's quite disconcerting to me, I mean</p>
<p t="1296520" d="5700">It's not like Christianity hasn't been rife with internal divisions like that between the Protestants and the Catholics</p>
<p t="1302410" d="2780">But I mean it also was the case that</p>
<p t="1305320" d="3900">What you might describe as the civil war that's been occurring within Islam</p>
<p t="1309320" d="6340">More or less started, as far as I can tell, more or less started the day that Muhammad died and has never stopped since then and</p>
<p t="1315660" d="4820">That also seems to be, well obviously it's a problem for the Islamic community itself</p>
<p t="1320490" d="5460">But it also seems to be a problem, an increasing problem for the West because we can't not be tangled up in that</p>
<p t="1326820" d="3800">Yeah, we have to share the planet with one fifth of humanity</p>
<p t="1330620" d="7860">And it's very clear that things have to change and that is duty of Muslims to change the theological</p>
<p t="1338680" d="2300">underpinnings of their religion</p>
<p t="1341680" d="6980">And as far as I'm concerned. This is being pushed by those that I call reformers or modifiers. (Yeah)</p>
<p t="1349160" d="3600">And these are Individuals, who maybe now a little bigger in their groups</p>
<p t="1352760" d="6720">They're forming groups, and maybe even being led by some nation states, the leaders of countries</p>
<p t="1360580" d="2299">Who are pushing for that change</p>
<p t="1363340" d="8400">The big question is are they going to agree on what to change, so what is inbuilt into Islam is this idea</p>
<p t="1371740" d="5160">that you cannot argue with God. You cannot unsubmit</p>
<p t="1377250" d="3869">And edit to the Quran and it's the same thing you know Mohammed was</p>
<p t="1382380" d="2720">Is seen by Muslims as infallible (Yeah)</p>
<p t="1385260" d="7620">As someone who never made a mistake so it's an uphill battle for those Muslims inside Islam, who were seeking</p>
<p t="1392880" d="2200">modernization, who are seeking reform</p>
<p t="1395140" d="1560">to</p>
<p t="1396700" d="5089">Agree on, you know, how to edit God how toughest to pursuade Muslims to accept</p>
<p t="1402580" d="2000">a truly peaceful</p>
<p t="1404860" d="6829">(Right) and a truly tolerant idea of religion that separates religion from politics respects the rights of women</p>
<p t="1412140" d="6180">respects the rights or people of other faiths and people within Islam who want to leave their faiths, so</p>
<p t="1419140" d="4140">How do you get the theological underpinnings for that? (Yeah)</p>
<p t="1423280" d="2580">That's the big button within Islam.</p>
<p t="1425860" d="1180">Well yeah, and the danger there too</p>
<p t="1427040" d="6640">Is that, I mean, when that sort of thing is attempted, often, reform from within a religious community, one of the dangers there is that</p>
<p t="1434020" d="6140">Instead of reforming it peacefully all you do is add another sect to the conflict</p>
<p t="1440160" d="7640">Yeah for us secular people it seems from from a distance, It seems kind of easy to say well why don't they just separate</p>
<p t="1448660" d="4760">Religion from politics and then people 
who want to be religious, they can be religious</p>
<p t="1453700" d="2569">But to look at it that way is simplistic because</p>
<p t="1456269" d="4770">Then you get people who want to be religious, this Medina subset, who want to say</p>
<p t="1461710" d="6229">For a medina Muslim, an expression of his Muslim-ness is to convert you to Islam</p>
<p t="1468140" d="8880">(Yeah) to kill me as an apostate. It's to get women to cover up. It's to keep warning us about life after death and all of that.</p>
<p t="1477400" d="5960">It's the thing that's that made me, I would say nervous to some degree from the perspective of someone</p>
<p t="1483560" d="3060">who analyzes totalitarian ideology because the thing about</p>
<p t="1486720" d="4680">Totalitarian ideology is it tends to be totalitarian, right? It's all absolutely</p>
<p t="1491520" d="1960">all-consuming and (yeah)</p>
<p t="1493480" d="1290">That's that's why</p>
<p t="1494770" d="6230">also when I've been assessing because, I've done a fair bit of research into comparative religion and done my best to</p>
<p t="1501360" d="1220">Expand my knowledge base</p>
<p t="1502590" d="2000">And I've always had a hard time</p>
<p t="1504610" d="7069">With Islam in that regard because it's difficult for me to extract out the purely religious elements and to compare them to</p>
<p t="1512100" d="7600">Let's say religious sentiments that have emerged across, across humankind in all sorts of different times and eras and to separate that from the political</p>
<p t="1519760" d="3020">Doctrine and sometimes I'm tempted to think more that</p>
<p t="1523390" d="1140">Islam</p>
<p t="1524530" d="5840">You know, broadly and vaguely speaking, is something much more like a political movement than it is in fact like a religious movement</p>
<p t="1530470" d="3709">It is a political theory and it's a political movement it started out</p>
<p t="1534850" d="5209">Even in Mecca in the early days come to my god, which was a political message</p>
<p t="1540060" d="7340">It wasn't just a religious message (Right) even in the early days in Mecca it was absolutist, Islam by its nature is</p>
<p t="1547400" d="3360">Absolutist because it seeks complete and total</p>
<p t="1550820" d="7120">Submission of the individual to God and in Medina Muhammad then came around with a political</p>
<p t="1558900" d="6320">blueprint for how society ought to live the relationship between the individual and God</p>
<p t="1565440" d="8040">The relationship between men and women, husband and wife, the relationship between parent and child, the relationship between the government</p>
<p t="1574300" d="2000">the kalif</p>
<p t="1576300" d="1580">However you want to pronounce it</p>
<p t="1578080" d="4700">And the subjects and their duties, it has a court system</p>
<p t="1582780" d="4109">It has a military system. So from it's very beginnings</p>
<p t="1587200" d="4400">Islam was more of a political theory than it was</p>
<p t="1591600" d="6780">A religion as we understand religion today. Jesus Christ founded his religion within an empire the Roman Empire existed</p>
<p t="1598660" d="3739">Before and what he was talking about was all religion</p>
<p t="1602860" d="3880">Whereas Muhammad founded an empire we forget that.</p>
<p t="1606740" d="2240">Yes right, that's a very important distinction</p>
<p t="1608980" d="3780">I mean it really might be the crucial distinction, so to speak</p>
<p t="1612760" d="7840">Definitely the crucial distinction, and there was this Empire and this empire grows and declined and fell and those who feel that</p>
<p t="1620610" d="3899">They have inherited that legacy, they want to go back to the days of empire</p>
<p t="1624540" d="5160">(Yeah) they want to go back the days when, you know, Islam was supreme and</p>
<p t="1629940" d="5040">They want to do this in the 21st century when wanting all kinds</p>
<p t="1634980" d="3720">it's not just that you can't come on horseback and invade</p>
<p t="1638820" d="4700">An existing empire in decline like the Byzantine or like, you know, old Rome and</p>
<p t="1644040" d="6320">Some of these Indian empires that they took over, you could just take things it's not like that, but they're driven</p>
<p t="1650700" d="1280">They're convinced</p>
<p t="1651980" d="2100">They have this legacy,</p>
<p t="1654080" d="1820">and they're not afraid of death.</p>
<p t="1655900" d="3900">and that is key because, and here's why I keep going back to Dawa</p>
<p t="1660340" d="4960">all Muslim children learn that life on this earth is temporary</p>
<p t="1665400" d="5940">(Yeah) That it is transitory and that there is something in the hereafter. This is no point in investing in this life</p>
<p t="1671520" d="2900">Except in a religious sense, so for the Medina Muslims</p>
<p t="1674740" d="5210">It really becomes easy to recruit and inspire into their ranks</p>
<p t="1681430" d="2300">Muslims who have already been taught that</p>
<p t="1684370" d="2119">They've only got to work for the Hereafter</p>
<p t="1686520" d="6690">there are problems with Islam, and I think if, once we understand of course the basic elements of</p>
<p t="1694510" d="6050">Mohammed's role, the role of the Quran, the role of the Hereafter. All of these things and what Sharia law really means</p>
<p t="1700800" d="4349">And then we get to the Dawa part this is how do they manage to teach?</p>
<p t="1706600" d="5809">Young people how do they manage to teach all of these thousands and millions of people, who is subsidizing this?</p>
<p t="1712690" d="5420">Countries like Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Kuwait etc. Once we understand that I think then</p>
<p t="1718210" d="4369">It makes our job as westerners, western governments, whatever, easier.</p>
<p t="1722800" d="4520">Let's talk about the Saudis for a minute, the elephant under the Western carpet</p>
<p t="1727320" d="5600">I mean I understand that in the aftermath of the oil crisis in the 1970s one of the things that</p>
<p t="1733040" d="7900">Dictated American foreign policy was the desire to maintain stable oil production and I can understand that although I think it was short-sighted, I can</p>
<p t="1740940" d="1660">I can see the logic in that</p>
<p t="1742600" d="7740">But it's very difficult for me to see that in any possible way the Saudis can be regarded as true allies of the West</p>
<p t="1750880" d="3640">and so I don't understand why we have the</p>
<p t="1755040" d="3480">Relationship that we do have with the Saudis given first of all that we're pumping</p>
<p t="1758940" d="7160">literally trillions of dollars every, about every decade into their economy and then given that they practice a particularly pernicious</p>
<p t="1766260" d="7940">Form of, I would say viciously militant, Islam and second, or third I guess that is, is that they're pumping out</p>
<p t="1774520" d="5440">Propaganda that pushes this Wahhabi viewpoint in massive doses everywhere in the world</p>
<p t="1779970" d="570">I mean</p>
<p t="1780540" d="5789">I don't understand and maybe this is also part of your perplexity with regards to Western attitudes towards</p>
<p t="1786580" d="3380">towards the complex problem of Islam, I don't understand why</p>
<p t="1790480" d="6589">The West doesn't do more to put a stop to that and so what are your thoughts about that how does it look to you?</p>
<p t="1797980" d="930">I'm perplexed</p>
<p t="1798910" d="5370">I believe that the Saudis have put the United States and other Westerners under their spell</p>
<p t="1804280" d="3020">And someone has to come along and break that spell</p>
<p t="1808520" d="2620">I mean I agree with everything you said</p>
<p t="1811900" d="7300">Within Saudi Arabia there are, I believe, at least three forces, the royal family, who I believe</p>
<p t="1819560" d="3040">Now they want to be more secular and more modern</p>
<p t="1822600" d="2060">They want to go down the path of the UAE</p>
<p t="1825520" d="2000">Then there is the clergy.</p>
<p t="1827590" d="4880">Incredibly powerful, maybe even more powerful than the royal family, because</p>
<p t="1833170" d="2000">The Clergy in Saudi Arabia</p>
<p t="1835450" d="6109">They have the power to put into people's, you know, heads and hearts</p>
<p t="1842290" d="2000">the Wahhabi doctrine</p>
<p t="1844720" d="4820">and so, They're all about.. in Saudi Arabia</p>
<p t="1849820" d="2660">The people who decide what's right and what's wrong</p>
<p t="1853200" d="8660">Morally, are the clergy. (Right) They are that powerful. And then you have the tribes the various tribes who obviously</p>
<p t="1862100" d="1980">depending on their size</p>
<p t="1864340" d="5239">Can either empower the royal family or the clergy or both. There's a dynamic there</p>
<p t="1870220" d="3950">that is very interesting to watch, but in that sense</p>
<p t="1874900" d="7040">Saudi Arabia has used and has indulged and accommodated the clergy, not only to establish</p>
<p t="1882160" d="6080">this Wahabbi doctrine, which is pure Medina legacy, Saudi Arabia is a theocracy (Yeah) its pure Medina.</p>
<p t="1888960" d="5560">Not only inside the borders of Saudi Arabia, but across the entire world.</p>
<p t="1895060" d="4960">(Yeah) and now I think we the United States and other countries need to demand</p>
<p t="1900240" d="4960">From the Saudi royal family because they're the ones who are the political,  at least</p>
<p t="1905620" d="7100">The political individuals that we deal with and sit across from at the table, to demand  and say you know we need a divorce</p>
<p t="1913300" d="2420">Between the house of our south and the house of our (???)</p>
<p t="1916140" d="4320">Because these clergy people are really destroying the planet</p>
<p t="1920980" d="6880">They, you just, you have to think through what these people have done in South Asia in Africa</p>
<p t="1928720" d="2740">All over the world it's the duty of</p>
<p t="1931680" d="5940">Theocracy like Saudi Arabia to commit a part of its wealth to the spread of Islam</p>
<p t="1937860" d="4380">(Yes) and to the strengthening of Islam, that's pure Dawa that is through institutions</p>
<p t="1942669" d="5630">And this is this is their foreign policy we probably could refer that to a soft power</p>
<p t="1948340" d="5390">That's where the soft power goes, but that if you look at what is happening all these terrorist</p>
<p t="1954280" d="2440">activities across the world</p>
<p t="1956720" d="5860">People wanting Sharia back all of this Saudi Arabia is behind it, and I think it's time that (Yeah) we wake up to that.</p>
<p t="1963000" d="5900">Yeah, okay, so let me run a theory by you. It's kind of a two-fold theory so one is that</p>
<p t="1969120" d="7360">there's a paternalistic attitude in the west towards the Saudis that stems from perhaps events that were as</p>
<p t="1976560" d="6740">Far back as a hundred years ago, and the paternalistic aspect is to underestimate them as enemies</p>
<p t="1983889" d="2030">Right, because you say well we could say well</p>
<p t="1985919" d="5099">We need the oil and we're gonna stabilize it and maybe that we'd rather not have chaos in Saudi Arabia</p>
<p t="1991019" d="3930">And so a known dictator is better than unknown chaos and I mean we saw</p>
<p t="1995139" d="4520">Some proof of that perhaps in what happened with Libya, but so the idea would be</p>
<p t="2000240" d="4320">There's nothing sufficiently dangerous about the Saudis to justify us</p>
<p t="2004560" d="6680">destabilizing their regime especially when we're particularly dependent on their oil. And then underneath that would be an</p>
<p t="2011240" d="6220">Underestimation of the danger of ideas and also especially when ideas are combined with money, it's something like that</p>
<p t="2017800" d="2420">So because the Saudis in some sense</p>
<p t="2020220" d="6420">I think are fighting what you might regard as a stealth war against the West and they're doing it by convincing</p>
<p t="2027190" d="6230">Upcoming generations of the rightness of their particular viewpoint, and so they're in it for the long haul in some sense</p>
<p t="2033420" d="2600">And I think we're radically under estimating the danger of that</p>
<p t="2036720" d="3480">They're waging and idealogical war and we're not (yeah, yeah, yeah)</p>
<p t="2040680" d="5080">They're waging and idealogical war,  we're not, I mean you have to think of when the Soviet Union was around</p>
<p t="2045940" d="6020">If we hadn't done anything in response if we had only viewed that in economic terms or in military terms, yeah</p>
<p t="2051960" d="5440">And that is our way, not just Saudi Arabia there is Qatar there is Kuwait</p>
<p t="2057400" d="6680">There is even Iran, you know, these countries are waging an ideological war and we are not because here</p>
<p t="2064680" d="6500">They believe well, It's religion and religion is protected and you know we don't talk about religion</p>
<p t="2071560" d="2000">That's one thing we believe</p>
<p t="2073690" d="2000">We're under the spell of these</p>
<p t="2075700" d="2820">incredibly charming Saudis that come to attend our</p>
<p t="2078520" d="6460">Universities that have their embassies here and business leaders and that we are sure as their more westernized than we are</p>
<p t="2085120" d="2380">Yeah, well you can tell that by how they treat their women</p>
<p t="2089240" d="2540">Yeah, so in a way, I think again</p>
<p t="2091820" d="3260">I just keep going back to saying we are under some sort of spell</p>
<p t="2095080" d="4800">And at some point you know someone has to come and break that spell (Yeah)</p>
<p t="2100560" d="2980">through more globalization, through you know</p>
<p t="2104590" d="7690">As Saudi Arabia opens up to the world economy we really see with our eyes, what goes on inside their own country and inside</p>
<p t="2112780" d="2300">Not just Saudi Arabia, all these other countries</p>
<p t="2115260" d="4660">It's the American people, the Canadian people, Western people who should say no</p>
<p t="2120300" d="5360">To this and demand from their governments that they engage with Saudi Arabia in a different way.</p>
<p t="2125820" d="3869">Yeah, well one of the things I really can't figure out. Maybe you could shed some light on this too</p>
<p t="2129690" d="6120">Is that you know of all the things that women's political movements should be doing in the West is</p>
<p t="2136630" d="2870">Demanding, as far as I can tell, that the Western countries</p>
<p t="2139720" d="7370">Let's say led by their male rulers stop treating the Saudis like are they're our allies, and I cannot understand why there hasn't been</p>
<p t="2147640" d="6330">Concerted pressure put on Western governments by women who are concerned, at least in principle, with the</p>
<p t="2154280" d="2000">equality and freedom of women around the world to</p>
<p t="2156380" d="6469">stop treating the Saudis like they're our allies and so, that's another thing that perplexes me entirely and the</p>
<p t="2163010" d="6049">Cynical part of me thinks that the feminists who are more or less hell bent on the destruction of the Western</p>
<p t="2169309" d="3470">Patriarchy, adopt the attitude that the enemy of my enemy is my friend</p>
<p t="2172849" d="2479">And so they're willing to put up with what the Saudis do</p>
<p t="2175329" d="4890">But I don't think that's a sufficient explanation so, like, and I mean you can view our</p>
<p t="2180650" d="6050">culture so to speak a little bit from from the outside position because you've moved in as an immigrant and and that gives you a</p>
<p t="2186740" d="7459">Viewpoint that that it's much more difficult for someone within it to share and so like what do you see as driving the</p>
<p t="2194450" d="7010">Absence of pressure, let's say from women on governments in relationship to these, I would say, reprehensible dictatorships</p>
<p t="2201589" d="1831">What's going on?</p>
<p t="2203420" d="2840">So the feminists who are pre-occupied with</p>
<p t="2207049" d="4880">Western patriarchy, with the white man's patriarchy, what I see is that they have</p>
<p t="2212150" d="5899">first of all that's all that they're focused only they do not talk about discuss raise the issue of</p>
<p t="2218839" d="4640">men of color and the patriarchy of men of color, of immigrants of</p>
<p t="2224800" d="6300">the nations and countries men in nations and countries outside of the West.</p>
<p t="2231100" d="5440">Number two these femenists have also bought into the identity politics</p>
<p t="2236559" d="2070">They've bought into cultural relativism</p>
<p t="2239180" d="2460">They've bought into Multiculturalism</p>
<p t="2241660" d="6040">And all these things are bad for women bad for Western women and bad for all women</p>
<p t="2247880" d="5220">So if you believe, take multiculturalism for instance, that all cultures are equal and that</p>
<p t="2253100" d="7600">One person of one culture, the white culture, should have nothing to say about the culture of Islam or, you know,</p>
<p t="2261220" d="3300">Since it's, they're all sort of equal then</p>
<p t="2265160" d="2149">They feel that they can't use</p>
<p t="2268200" d="2000">their institutional power</p>
<p t="2270900" d="5940">To pressure our government to address the patriarchy of the outside</p>
<p t="2276880" d="6600">They believe that if black women and Muslim women and, you know, women of color if they wanted to get out of</p>
<p t="2283580" d="3615">Oppression then they should organize themselves that's what they believe.</p>
<p t="2287200" d="3900">What I find ironic though is that sometimes when we do organize ourselves?</p>
<p t="2291100" d="5240">I am organized with other ex-Muslim women to talk about the misogyny, that's</p>
<p t="2297020" d="2820">Subjected to women in the name of Islam</p>
<p t="2300380" d="1780">I get it from white femenists</p>
<p t="2302300" d="4660">White feminist atheists, and that to me is the biggest puzzle ever</p>
<p t="2306960" d="5055">I know well I think that the treatment that you've received at the hand of Western feminists to me</p>
<p t="2312015" d="2425">That's something that's just absolutely...</p>
<p t="2314500" d="2180">it leaves me absolutely speechless because</p>
<p t="2317600" d="2720">Not only me, it's all of us who are fighting...</p>
<p t="2320320" d="7980">Again like just only two ex-muslims, but they're black women who are fighting for their rights and they all get shut down</p>
<p t="2328970" d="6679">So we were talking about your treatment at the hands. Let's say of Western feminists, and like I read infidel</p>
<p t="2336160" d="5300">I Don't know, very shortly after you published it which and I loved that book man as soon as I read that I thought</p>
<p t="2341860" d="1740">Well, I you know use...</p>
<p t="2343600" d="1300">Which book which book? I missed that.</p>
<p t="2344900" d="760">Infidel</p>
<p t="2346100" d="2840">(Infidel yeah) yeah, yeah, you know I thought it was remarkable</p>
<p t="2349000" d="7469">I thought your comment or your comments on viewing Western culture from the perspective of an immigrant that was hungry for</p>
<p t="2356869" d="3979">genuine education and and your comments on your experience</p>
<p t="2361700" d="4010">With the efficiency of the Dutch state say and you're sort of amazement</p>
<p t="2365710" d="3929">at how well it worked that was just, I thought that was so remarkable and clear-headed</p>
<p t="2369640" d="1890">And I thought when I read Infidel</p>
<p t="2371530" d="6270">I thought, well look this woman is immediately going to be a hero to feminists everywhere because she's removed herself from this</p>
<p t="2377869" d="4250">oppressive state and moved out into the world and become a powerful figure when what was the</p>
<p t="2382339" d="5300">Probability of that it was like zero, you know, and then you suffered as a consequence of your beliefs</p>
<p t="2387640" d="5729">And and you stood up forthrightly for them, and I thought if you wanted to find a feminist hero that you're certainly</p>
<p t="2394099" d="5540">You're certainly in the running man for exactly that, and then to see how you've been treated</p>
<p t="2399700" d="4800">Is just, it just makes my jaw drop you know that your dis...</p>
<p t="2404500" d="6420">Especially what Brandeis did, it was Brandeis right where you were offered an honorary PhD and then they revoked it? That just (Yeah)</p>
<p t="2411200" d="7400">that was one of the, I think that was almost as reprehensible an act of cowardice as the West's basic abandonment of</p>
<p t="2419240" d="3979">Salman Rushdie after the fatwa was put on his head and about equally dangerous</p>
<p t="2424280" d="2089">(So)I think it was multicultural</p>
<p t="2426369" d="1301">I mean what I...</p>
<p t="2427670" d="4520">You know my message my life story who I am it's a</p>
<p t="2432410" d="7820">Defiance of the prevalent trends of today, it's against relativism. I believe that Western values are</p>
<p t="2440800" d="7660">superior to Islamic law and Islamic values now to say that is to blaspheme in the temples of</p>
<p t="2448620" d="3240">multiculturalism today right and, I think I</p>
<p t="2452060" d="5440">(wrote it for a lot of people?) because it wasn't about what they think should happen for</p>
<p t="2458630" d="6739">victims of misogyny I think it's all about the dissonance that my words and my life and</p>
<p t="2465920" d="7699">My beliefs the kind of dissonance they put these women in because if you're going around saying well</p>
<p t="2473619" d="5520">It's horrible to be an American woman ,and the misogyny in America is worse than that in Afghanistan</p>
<p t="2479140" d="2000">And I can't rather I say no it's not</p>
<p t="2481280" d="2260">(Right) you know, I, I'm</p>
<p t="2483540" d="2860">Im sort of Interfering with their worldview.</p>
<p t="2486400" d="2340">The claim that you're making there is something like this</p>
<p t="2489560" d="6019">And it's read it's a really vicious claim in a sense, and it's something like, the Western feminists</p>
<p t="2495579" d="4290">Who are possessed by post-modernism and cultural relativism are willing to sacrifice</p>
<p t="2500660" d="6860">The freedom and equality of third world women in places like Saudi Arabia to maintain the sanctity of their</p>
<p t="2507770" d="6290">Multicultural notion because that justifies their attack on Western patriarchy, so (absolutely) they're willing to use...</p>
<p t="2514730" d="2000">Okay, so that's an absolutely...</p>
<p t="2518359" d="3890">Immigration, there are so many immigrant men who are coming from these</p>
<p t="2522530" d="4159">Societies that as men that they are not used to the Equality of women</p>
<p t="2526760" d="7780">and they attack women inside the West. First of all their own women, child marriages, female genital mutilation</p>
<p t="2534620" d="3860">Honor killings, but now we have these rapes and</p>
<p t="2538740" d="1900">sexual harassment of</p>
<p t="2540700" d="4200">non-Muslim women and these women keep on arguing for more immigration</p>
<p t="2545400" d="6160">and they wont hear anything, anything negative about some of the negative impacts of immigration</p>
<p t="2551640" d="4060">I don't consider them feminists anymore. I think that there's so much more</p>
<p t="2556569" d="6979">Committed to preserving their worldview their postmodernist worldview than they are to the rights of women and I say...</p>
<p t="2563549" d="1290">Well thats what it looks like, I mean</p>
<p t="2564839" d="7500">I think that's how it looks to me is like the situation with Saudi Arabia's is the one, is the test case it's like</p>
<p t="2572740" d="2000">so you might say are the</p>
<p t="2574900" d="840">postmodern feminist</p>
<p t="2575740" d="2750">Types, or the ones who present themselves as that, are they more</p>
<p t="2578559" d="6530">Concerned with the rights of women or they are more concerned with bringing down the so called tyranny of the West and the answer is</p>
<p t="2585089" d="4200">They're more concerned with the latter than they are with the former because when you put them head-to-head</p>
<p t="2589289" d="5730">They'll dispense with the rights of women across the world as long as they can maintain their moral</p>
<p t="2595270" d="5299">justification for their radical beliefs, and I do think that is why they go after you because you're you're exactly the</p>
<p t="2601569" d="7969">Reprehensible exemplar of what it is that they're attempting to deny. I would say, and I think that it does show their true motivations</p>
<p t="2610390" d="6350">Absolutely and Jordan, we're out of time. I'm getting a lot of signals here that I should I should hang up</p>
<p t="2617049" d="2150">But I really enjoyed talking to you</p>
<p t="2619200" d="5100">And I hope that in some way I've contributed to to the message that you want to get out there.</p>
<p t="2624360" d="5440">Well you know, I'll stop with this, 30 seconds I'll just tell you what what I'm doing with this</p>
<p t="2629940" d="3480">I mean, I have arranged with a group of moderate Muslims in Canada</p>
<p t="2633609" d="5900">And some in the US as well to start a series of dialogues like the one that we had today because this is a really</p>
<p t="2640029" d="1491">viciously important problem</p>
<p t="2641520" d="2819">and so I want to use this as the opener for that</p>
<p t="2644339" d="5040">I would like to go after this issue of whether or not a real dialogue be begun between</p>
<p t="2649930" d="7669">The judeo-christian West and and the Islam world with some hope of not having all of this devolve into endless and continual warfare</p>
<p t="2657640" d="2120">Because as far as I can tell that's where it's headed</p>
<p t="2661420" d="1949">Yes, that's where it's headed yeah.</p>
<p t="2663369" d="2061">Well I hope we get a chance to talk again</p>
<p t="2666160" d="3020">Thank you, so do I. Thank you Jordan, thank you very much.</p>
<p t="2669820" d="580">Yeah</p>
