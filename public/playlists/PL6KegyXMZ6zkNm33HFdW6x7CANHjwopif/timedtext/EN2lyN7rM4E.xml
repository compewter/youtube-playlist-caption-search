<p t="12900" d="3600">So I am going to briefly review some of what I told you last time,</p>
<p t="17040" d="4960">and then I am going to walk through as I mentioned, I am going to walk through</p>
<p t="22000" d="4580">the Disney movie film Pinnochio and which I presume most of you have seen</p>
<p t="26580" d="1780">How many of you have seen it?</p>
<p t="28980" d="6000">Yeah, OK, that's, that's...so as I think I mentioned that is something in of itself right?</p>
<p t="34980" d="2640">I mean the fact that you have all seen it means that it's an</p>
<p t="37620" d="4340">production of cultural significance, and because it's such a strange artifact</p>
<p t="41960" d="3100">That's one way of looking at it, it might be worth</p>
<p t="45060" d="5220">trying to take it apart to understand why it is, for example, that you even understand it.</p>
<p t="50940" d="1240">and so,</p>
<p t="52720" d="3120">I offered you the proposition last week that we</p>
<p t="55840" d="2920">view the world as essentially through a narrative lens</p>
<p t="58760" d="3500">and I believe that we view the world through a narrative lens</p>
<p t="62260" d="2980">because the fundamental problem that we have to solve</p>
<p t="65240" d="3100">as living creatures is how we should act in the world.</p>
<p t="68980" d="500">and,</p>
<p t="69840" d="1040">that means,</p>
<p t="71120" d="2640">how we should act to maintain ourselves</p>
<p t="73760" d="3740">but also how we need to act in relationship to other people</p>
<p t="77820" d="5520">and in relationship to the broader world in order to maintain our self across time.</p>
<p t="83340" d="4240">so that's a complicated problem, right, it's not just how you survive</p>
<p t="87920" d="4480">it's how you survive now and next week, and next month, and next year</p>
<p t="93040" d="4080">and 50 years from now and maybe your,  your descendants as well</p>
<p t="97120" d="1740">if the culture is going to stabilize</p>
<p t="98860" d="5700">and then not only you across all those time frames but you and everyone else across all those time frames</p>
<p t="104560" d="2280">It's a viciously difficult problem</p>
<p t="107380" d="5160">and so, I would say that we have evolved mechanisms to solve that</p>
<p t="112540" d="5680">I think that is self-evident in some sense because for example one of the mechanisms that</p>
<p t="118480" d="4080">animals have evolved to deal with the problem of social being</p>
<p t="122560" d="2700">even if they are not particularly social animals</p>
<p t="125260" d="4840">is the dominance hierarchy, right, or you could call it hierarchy of authority or power, because</p>
<p t="130440" d="2080">I think that considering human</p>
<p t="133060" d="4600">structures, social structures as mere power</p>
<p t="137660" d="4380">structures is a terrible mistake, it's a terrible oversimplification</p>
<p t="143260" d="5220">because power is no means the only, like force is what I mean</p>
<p t="148480" d="5440">force is not a stable way of solving the problem of how to live together across time</p>
<p t="154380" d="4560">the question is what is the stable way of solving how to live together</p>
<p t="158940" d="3560">across time, and the really is the question and it's part of the question that</p>
<p t="162740" d="2040">I am trying to answer</p>
<p t="165300" d="5020">partly because it's a perennial problem, right, we face the problem of</p>
<p t="170460" d="3200">how to organize ourselves in small social units</p>
<p t="173660" d="2880">without undue conflict and then we face the larger problem</p>
<p t="176540" d="6400">of how to organize ourselves into large social units without undue conflict and that conflict can be</p>
<p t="183480" d="3460">absolutely devastating, and, and frequently is</p>
<p t="187460" d="500">so,</p>
<p t="188420" d="5440">so then I would also say that the first way of solving this problem isn't conscious</p>
<p t="194280" d="1200">you see, not at all</p>
<p t="196220" d="1140">and, you know</p>
<p t="197360" d="3000">you may know, and you may not know that there are</p>
<p t="200900" d="2400">there are different forms of memory</p>
<p t="203460" d="500">right</p>
<p t="203960" d="3260">really technically different forms of memory, so for example</p>
<p t="207440" d="2640">there is short term working memory</p>
<p t="210080" d="5840">which is the memory that you use to hold things like telephone numbers in your active imagination</p>
<p t="216000" d="3660">it decays very rapidly, it's only 4 to 7 bits</p>
<p t="219840" d="800">which is why</p>
<p t="220860" d="3040">well it's why phone numbers are, were at least</p>
<p t="224900" d="2560">7 digits long, you know, you can kind of</p>
<p t="228540" d="3140">manage that as a loop that, and then there is</p>
<p t="233740" d="7660">episodic memory, and that has two elements one is semantic and the other is episodic</p>
<p t="241620" d="2720">it's, what's the name of that</p>
<p t="245080" d="3980">mmm, someone said something...</p>
<p t="249060" d="1060">[Student] Procedural?</p>
<p t="250120" d="3840">Yes well there is procedural memory and then there is another</p>
<p t="253960" d="2960">the kind of memory that you use to represent your</p>
<p t="257360" d="5600">experiences to yourself, so let's say it is image laden and the other one is semantic</p>
<p t="262960" d="4380">and semantic is your memory for facts and those are quite different, so for example</p>
<p t="267840" d="1280">procedural memory</p>
<p t="269120" d="3500">that is how you ride a bike, that is how you play the piano</p>
<p t="272620" d="2920">that's how you play jazz music if you are in a combo</p>
<p t="275800" d="6640">it's, it's the memory, it's a funny kind of memory because it is built right into you, you know, I mean</p>
<p t="282440" d="6380">so is, so is, the kind of memory that you use to represent your own life, but it is much more malleable is some sense</p>
<p t="289040" d="4520">so, what that means is that in your procedures</p>
<p t="293560" d="6220">there is information that you don't know about, it's patterned information that you don't know about</p>
<p t="300060" d="1600">part of that is how to act</p>
<p t="301660" d="2860">you know, like, when you walk into a social gathering</p>
<p t="304520" d="2500">you don't really think through how you are going to act</p>
<p t="307340" d="2800">you know how to act, and if someone asks you</p>
<p t="310140" d="5000">exactly what it is that you are doing and why, you could formulate a story about it</p>
<p t="315140" d="6480">but the probability that, that it's the existence of that story that enabled you to act that way is zero, because</p>
<p t="321640" d="5120">you have to react way faster than that, and so, you know have social knowledge</p>
<p t="326760" d="6040">built into your nervous system because you have practiced being a social being for a very long period of time</p>
<p t="333160" d="7000">and of course, then that social being has been shaped forever really, it's the right way of thinking about it</p>
<p t="340160" d="4260">Now, we know that animals organized themselves into hierarchies</p>
<p t="344420" d="4720">and we will say of dominance, because it is more true the farther back you go in time</p>
<p t="349680" d="7000">at least since the time of the crustaceans, you know , when we split from out common ancestor 300 million years ago, and so</p>
<p t="356680" d="3220">and it's true for social animals and non-social animals so</p>
<p t="359980" d="3200">even animals that don't live together in groups</p>
<p t="363180" d="2820">have to organize themselves into a hierarchy</p>
<p t="366000" d="5160">in the space they inhabit, songbirds are a good example and they have dominance disputes all the time</p>
<p t="371240" d="7000">partly that's, you can hear them having their little dominance disputes in the spring when they are singing because basically what they are singing is</p>
<p t="378240" d="5740">I am pretty damn healthy and I am ready to go and if you are another bird like me you had better steer clear of this tree!</p>
<p t="384380" d="3200">and, the dominance songbirds</p>
<p t="387580" d="4380">you know, they don't live together, crows are social but don't most songbirds aren't</p>
<p t="392580" d="2880">the dominance songbirds get the best nest</p>
<p t="395540" d="3520">and the best nest is the one that doesn't get rained on</p>
<p t="399760" d="3440">it's not to windy and it is close to food sources, and</p>
<p t="403200" d="4320">you know, so they have the healthiest chicks and they attract the best mates, and</p>
<p t="407520" d="3940">like it is really important where you are positioned in the hierarchy even if you are not</p>
<p t="411460" d="5080">like a flock or a herd creature, now, we are more like herd creatures so it's even more</p>
<p t="416560" d="3920">it's even more relevant to us , but there is just no escaping</p>
<p t="420920" d="3880">a hierarchical arrangement in social being</p>
<p t="425060" d="1620">that is social being</p>
<p t="427180" d="5460">and, and, and it is evolutionary ancient beyond conception so</p>
<p t="432640" d="6760">300 million years ago there weren't trees, you know I mean, so the dominance hierarchy is older than trees</p>
<p t="439400" d="5260">so that is really something to think about and then, you know, when you are thinking about the reality that shaped us</p>
<p t="444660" d="4760">say, from an evolutionary perspective but also from a cultural perspective</p>
<p t="450180" d="7000">what you have to understand is that that the things that have shaped us most are the things that have been around the longest, and so you could say</p>
<p t="457320" d="2400">those are the most real things</p>
<p t="459720" d="5100">and you can't even see some of them, it's not like you can come in here and, well it's not exactly true</p>
<p t="464820" d="3900">you can't come in here and see the multiple dominance hierarchies that are at work</p>
<p t="468720" d="1620">You can in a way, because,</p>
<p t="470460" d="4160">the chairs are set up to face this way and I am facing that way and</p>
<p t="474620" d="4760">that gives you some clues about the social order here and you take the cues instantly, right</p>
<p t="479640" d="8000">you come down, you sit in the chairs, you organize yourselves according to mutual expectation and that's part of your procedural knowledge</p>
<p t="487640" d="2340">about how to behave as a social creature</p>
<p t="490400" d="500">now,</p>
<p t="490980" d="5120">that knowledge is really really deep and a lot of it is coded in your behaviour</p>
<p t="496100" d="2380">now, and in other peoples behaviour as well</p>
<p t="498480" d="6680">and that's, you know. that's the expectations you have of other people and of yourself, and a lot of those are implicit right,</p>
<p t="505280" d="500">so,</p>
<p t="505780" d="5980">when we are interacting there's, there is a very large number of things that you just don't get to do</p>
<p t="511960" d="5680">and you know that too, and you won't do them, and that way we can act as if we understand each other</p>
<p t="517640" d="3240">even though we don't, because you are really complicated</p>
<p t="520880" d="5180">and I am really complicated and there is lots of situations where we might really be in conflict</p>
<p t="526220" d="5020">but because we share a map of the culture, the cultural expectations</p>
<p t="531260" d="3600">it makes part of our, it's built right into our perception</p>
<p t="534860" d="3940">you will act out that set of expectations and so will I</p>
<p t="538800" d="6200">and if neither of us can do that, even if one of us can't we are going to stay, we are either going immediately</p>
<p t="545000" d="3940">devolve into conflict or we are going to avoid each other like the plague</p>
<p t="548940" d="1920">and that's exactly the right thing to do,</p>
<p t="550860" d="6420">and so, one of the really useful things to understand , and this took me a long time to formulate properly, you know,</p>
<p t="557280" d="3880">you hear the terror management theorists for example and they have this idea that</p>
<p t="561160" d="4660">your, your meaning representation, the story you tell about the world</p>
<p t="565980" d="3760">regulates your death anxiety, it's something like that</p>
<p t="569740" d="3560">but that is not right, I mean it is close to right and it is a smart idea</p>
<p t="573300" d="5960">it came from Ernest Becker by the way who wrote a book called ";The Denial of Death";, which is actually quite a good book even though it is wrong</p>
<p t="579260" d="2480">you know, sometimes a book can be very useful</p>
<p t="583280" d="4080">it can be usefully wrong, and Becker's book is usefully wrong</p>
<p t="587700" d="1600">because he thought that</p>
<p t="589520" d="3840">it's the internal representation of your belief system</p>
<p t="593360" d="3880">that regulates your anxiety and that anxiety is fundamentally</p>
<p t="597560" d="5760">in the final analysis anxiety about death, it's like well, OK, fine, it is a reasonable</p>
<p t="603720" d="2940">proposition, but that isn't how it works, you see,</p>
<p t="606800" d="3460">it isn't my beliefs that right now that are regulating my emotion</p>
<p t="610920" d="7000">It is the fact that I'm acting out those beliefs, which include implicit perceptions, I'm acting them out</p>
<p t="618140" d="1180">and so are you</p>
<p t="619400" d="6800">and so, what you're doing and what I expect, more accurately, what you're doing and what I want you to do</p>
<p t="626260" d="3440">and the way I want you to react to me, that's working!</p>
<p t="629700" d="7000">so it's the match between my belief system and the way that everyone else is acting that is regulating my emotions</p>
<p t="637000" d="1760">it's not the belief system</p>
<p t="638760" d="3940">it's mediated by the social culture and you see if you understand this then</p>
<p t="642920" d="3040">you understand more particularly why people</p>
<p t="645960" d="3260">are willing to fight to the bitter end to protect their culture</p>
<p t="649220" d="3340">it's not a psychological structure that they are protecting</p>
<p t="652780" d="5280">it's a psychological structure and sociological structure, simultaneously</p>
<p t="658060" d="1980">so the social contract is</p>
<p t="660040" d="3680">you have a set of expectations and I have a set of expectations</p>
<p t="663720" d="3740">they are actually desires, they are not merely expectations because as</p>
<p t="667460" d="3400">living creatures we are desirous, we don't just expect</p>
<p t="670940" d="3360">and so you desire an outcome and I desire an outcome</p>
<p t="674440" d="3000">and we agree to act in accordance with that</p>
<p t="677680" d="1840">that's the social contract</p>
<p t="679520" d="2780">and so people don't like having that disrupted</p>
<p t="682300" d="4320">well it isn't because it psychologically destabilizes them, although it does</p>
<p t="687100" d="2960">it's because it actually destabilizes them</p>
<p t="690300" d="3480">right, if all of a sudden we can't occupy the same</p>
<p t="693900" d="7000">specified domain of territory it isn't only that we are thrown into psychological disarray, although we will be</p>
<p t="701220" d="5040">it's that we will start fighting with each other, like, and that can kill you</p>
<p t="706260" d="3240">it's no joke, it kills people a lot, like it happens</p>
<p t="709500" d="5940">it can happen very easily that a cohesive social group can fragment along some fracture line</p>
<p t="715480" d="3440">of identity let's say, and all hell breaks loose</p>
<p t="719100" d="5860">and you know, that's what the Tutsi's and the Hutu in the, in the, in Rwanda</p>
<p t="725620" d="5040">and those things can get out of control just so fast it's just unbelievable and so</p>
<p t="730660" d="5280">and that wasn't, death anxiety, that was death, that's a whole different thing</p>
<p t="735940" d="3780">and that's the other thing that terror management people don't exactly get, it's like</p>
<p t="739720" d="4440">it isn't just that your culture and cultural beliefs protect you from anxiety</p>
<p t="744160" d="4720">and say anxiety about death even, it's that they actually protect you from death!</p>
<p t="748880" d="3040">as well as protecting you from death anxiety, I mean look</p>
<p t="753140" d="1120">It's warm in here</p>
<p t="755280" d="1200">it's cold outside</p>
<p t="756500" d="4960">the fact that the culture is intact means that you are not outside freezing</p>
<p t="761460" d="5260">that's a hell of a lot more fundamental in some sense than mere anxiety, although</p>
<p t="766720" d="4440">I am not trying to underplay the role of anxiety that's a major issue, but</p>
<p t="771160" d="4280">there is something that is a lot more fundamental at stake that mere psychology</p>
<p t="775560" d="7240">so it's the match between your map of the world and  other peoples actions that regulates your emotions</p>
<p t="783420" d="3040">and, and it regulates it completely, because</p>
<p t="786640" d="4240">you know if someone in here starting acting seriously deranged</p>
<p t="790960" d="2400">like brandished a pistol, let's say</p>
<p t="793760" d="3780">all of a sudden you would not be in the same place</p>
<p t="797600" d="640">at all</p>
<p t="798720" d="880">not a bit</p>
<p t="800060" d="2000">and so what would happen, well</p>
<p t="802860" d="1280">chaos would happen</p>
<p t="804140" d="4720">and chaos isn't just that you would get anxious, that's not a good enough explanation</p>
<p t="808860" d="5400">what would happen is a lot more complex than that, what happens in some sense is that your body</p>
<p t="814260" d="6820">and it does this, it does this, what would happen is that you would react the same way that a rat reacts to a cat</p>
<p t="821080" d="3480">it's exactly that, it's exactly that, you would respond as if</p>
<p t="824900" d="3040">a terrible predator had emerged in your midst</p>
<p t="827940" d="3520">And so, What is that reaction? Well it's not just anxiety</p>
<p t="831780" d="2640">because, when you encounter a predator</p>
<p t="834420" d="5580">anxiety isn't the only thing that is useful, that would just make you freeze, that could be the worst thing you could do</p>
<p t="840020" d="2880">freeze and well you are a pretty easy target</p>
<p t="843440" d="4960">so you have to be prepared for a lot broader range of responses that mere, mere</p>
<p t="849540" d="2040">mere, petrification</p>
<p t="851580" d="2280">like how about a little aggression</p>
<p t="853860" d="3460">that might be helpful, you don't know it also might get you killed but,</p>
<p t="857320" d="3680">but maybe you could take the guy down and maybe that's a good idea</p>
<p t="861400" d="4640">you know and, and maybe you have to run, so that's disinhibited as well</p>
<p t="866040" d="2080">and maybe you have to think really quickly</p>
<p t="868120" d="5380">and reflexively, so that happens, that's actively disinhibited I would say as well, it's like</p>
<p t="873720" d="4640">your whole being thrown into intense concentration on the moment</p>
<p t="878360" d="5180">and you are burning up physiological resources like mad, and so what will happen after something like that</p>
<p t="883540" d="4720">if you don't develop outright post-traumatic stress disorder, which some of you would</p>
<p t="888260" d="4280">is that, you'd, assuming that the situation was brought under control</p>
<p t="892540" d="5380">you would walk out of here shaking with your heart rate at like 170, and it would take you like</p>
<p t="897920" d="2540">well it might take you the rest of your life</p>
<p t="900460" d="5200">and maybe you would never recover, but you could be bloody well be sure that it would take you the rest of the day</p>
<p t="905660" d="1120">that's for sure!</p>
<p t="907300" d="500">and so</p>
<p t="908580" d="5120">it's no joke when someone steps outside the confines of the social contract</p>
<p t="913700" d="3240">right, and that is kind of, there is a philosopher named Hobbes</p>
<p t="916940" d="5340">who I suppose in some sense was a centrally conservative philosopher as oppose to Rousseau</p>
<p t="922280" d="1540">who is kind of his exact opposite</p>
<p t="923820" d="2920">Rousseau believed that people were basically good</p>
<p t="926740" d="3800">in their natural state, so he believed that nature was basically good</p>
<p t="930540" d="2520">and he believed that culture was what corrupted people</p>
<p t="933340" d="720">and so</p>
<p t="935640" d="5920">Hobbes believed exactly the opposite, he believed that in the state of nature, let's say</p>
<p t="941740" d="3120">every person was at every other persons throat</p>
<p t="945000" d="5420">and the only thing that prevented continual chaos was the imposition of a</p>
<p t="950420" d="3900">of a collective agreement that would be the social contract</p>
<p t="954320" d="4980">that essentially governed how people would interact and that would keep that underlying chaos</p>
<p t="959840" d="700">at bay</p>
<p t="960640" d="560">and you know</p>
<p t="961480" d="4880">my contention is is that Hobbes was correct and Rousseau was correct, and</p>
<p t="966360" d="6680">and I think that if you add Rousseau and Hobbes together you get a total picture of the world and that's really</p>
<p t="973040" d="4860">I think the picture of the world that I am trying to  relate to you, it's both at once, it's like</p>
<p t="978140" d="3380">well, you can't just attribute human</p>
<p t="982700" d="3120">malevolence and unpredictability to society</p>
<p t="986060" d="1580">it's a non starter</p>
<p t="987640" d="4020">it's like, people built society so all you are doing is pushing the problem back, it's like</p>
<p t="991660" d="1320">where did it come from</p>
<p t="993220" d="2920">well, the society, the society before</p>
<p t="996140" d="2620">well then, the one before that, it's like well</p>
<p t="998760" d="4400">you got to tangle up the individual in there at some point, right, because people created society</p>
<p t="1003620" d="500">and so,</p>
<p t="1005040" d="4560">you can't just blame human irrationality and malevolence on society</p>
<p t="1009600" d="3780">well and also, it's, it's ungrateful for God's sake, it's like</p>
<p t="1013380" d="5820">society obviously also makes you peaceful, part of the reason you are peaceful right now, all of you is because</p>
<p t="1019200" d="1640">well, you are not that hungry,</p>
<p t="1020840" d="5720">you are certainly not starving to death, you would be a very, very different person if you were starving right now</p>
<p t="1026600" d="4800">you know, or if you were enraged or if you were panicking or if you were terrified</p>
<p t="1031400" d="4380">because your future was radically uncertain, I mean you are not just</p>
<p t="1036040" d="2480">any of those people right now, you're</p>
<p t="1038800" d="3840">satiated, and I mean that technically, you're satisfied</p>
<p t="1042640" d="3340">none of your biological systems except perhaps curiousity</p>
<p t="1045980" d="2280">which is a rather pleasant emotion</p>
<p t="1048540" d="2520">are activated in the least</p>
<p t="1051060" d="3820">and, you know, because of that you all think that you are in control of yourself</p>
<p t="1054880" d="2900">but don't be thinking that, that's just not right</p>
<p t="1057780" d="3420">you mean, if you look at how the brain is structured, for example</p>
<p t="1061200" d="3980">the hypothalamus which is a really important part of the brain, it basically</p>
<p t="1065440" d="5060">it basically establishes the framework of reference and the actions</p>
<p t="1070500" d="3560">the framework of reference within which and the actions you take</p>
<p t="1074060" d="2680">in order to fulfill basic biological needs</p>
<p t="1076740" d="3400">so the hypothalamus makes you thirsty, and the hypothalamus makes you hungry</p>
<p t="1080140" d="1780">and it makes you sexually aroused</p>
<p t="1081920" d="2940">and it puts you into a state of defensive aggression, and</p>
<p t="1085020" d="3160">it actually also makes you explore</p>
<p t="1088180" d="4300">and be curious and all of that's hypothalamic, it is an amazing structure</p>
<p t="1092780" d="560">and then</p>
<p t="1093340" d="3300">and it's really small and it's right at the base of the brain</p>
<p t="1096720" d="4640">and you could imagine it as something that has tremendously powerful</p>
<p t="1101360" d="2780">projections upward throughout the rest of the brain into the</p>
<p t="1104140" d="3180">emotional systems and the cortical systems and all of that, like</p>
<p t="1107460" d="4480">tree trunk sized connections, you know, metaphorically speaking and then</p>
<p t="1111940" d="3500">the cortex has these little vine-like tendrils going down</p>
<p t="1115440" d="1940">to regulate the hypothalamus</p>
<p t="1117380" d="2340">you know, and when push comes to shove</p>
<p t="1120100" d="3320">man, the hypothalamus, that thing wins!</p>
<p t="1123460" d="2800">and so, you know you get people now and then</p>
<p t="1126260" d="4420">who have a hypothalamic dysfunction and one of them produces a condition called</p>
<p t="1131020" d="3020">I can't remember it, it's not dypsomania</p>
<p t="1134040" d="2640">although it's like that, it doesn't matter</p>
<p t="1136740" d="2400">it produces uncontrollable thirst</p>
<p t="1139140" d="4460">and so what will happen is that people that have this hypothalamic problem</p>
<p t="1143600" d="3980">will drown themselves by drinking water, which you can do by the way</p>
<p t="1148320" d="3020">and so they just cannot get enough water</p>
<p t="1151640" d="2480">and there is not stopping them, right</p>
<p t="1154120" d="4800">no more that there would be stopping you if you were suffering from raging thirst, it's like</p>
<p t="1158920" d="3920">it's a happy day when the hypothalamus is not telling you what to do</p>
<p t="1163040" d="4400">and you know you live in such a civilized state that most of the time</p>
<p t="1168380" d="3600">roughly speaking, you are tranquil and satisfied and</p>
<p t="1172760" d="3360">more or less you can imagine yourself as a peaceful</p>
<p t="1176400" d="2940">you know, productive, well meaning</p>
<p t="1180860" d="800">entity</p>
<p t="1181660" d="4440">but don't be thinking that's you would be if you were put in the right situation</p>
<p t="1186100" d="1720">because that's just not right at all</p>
<p t="1188540" d="500">so,</p>
<p t="1189040" d="4880">you know lots of times soldiers develop post-traumatic stress disorder because they go out on the battlefield</p>
<p t="1194080" d="3880">they are kind of naive, they are young guys you know and...</p>
<p t="1197960" d="4660">It is actually is worse if they are not that bright it turns out because having a lower IQ</p>
<p t="1202620" d="3660">is one of the things that predisposes you to post-traumatic stress disorder, but anyways</p>
<p t="1206280" d="4920">they go out on the battlefield and they see what they are capable of under battlefield conditions, and like</p>
<p t="1211720" d="3680">you know, we have been fighting wars for a very long time</p>
<p t="1215400" d="4500">millions of years, you know chimps basically have wars with other chimps</p>
<p t="1219900" d="3820">the troupes right, because the juveniles will patrol the</p>
<p t="1223720" d="5500">perimeter of their territory and if they find other chimps from other troupes that they outnumber</p>
<p t="1229580" d="1920">they will tear them to pieces</p>
<p t="1231500" d="5860">like and chimps are really strong, and so, when I say they'll tear them to pieces I mean that literally you know</p>
<p t="1237780" d="1600">hey tear them to pieces</p>
<p t="1239380" d="5640">and Jane Goodall discovered that originally in the 1970's, she didn't even report it for a while because</p>
<p t="1245180" d="1640">she was so shocked, you know</p>
<p t="1247320" d="6240">she kind of assumed like most followers of Rousseau that the human proclivity for warfare was</p>
<p t="1253980" d="2880">that was something that was uniquely human</p>
<p t="1256860" d="1580">you know, it had something to do with our</p>
<p t="1258440" d="4020">our unique self-consciousness or our intelligence or something like that</p>
<p t="1262460" d="2140">she had no idea that it was rooted</p>
<p t="1265180" d="1300">that deeply</p>
<p t="1266480" d="4900">you know, we split from chimps about  6, 7 million years ago something like that, and so</p>
<p t="1271660" d="4040">we were patrolling territory, we were gang members</p>
<p t="1276260" d="2680">7 million years ago, and, you know</p>
<p t="1279400" d="4560">that's a minimum estimation because of course that ancestor</p>
<p t="1284740" d="5020">shaded back, maybe, 20 million years into</p>
<p t="1290160" d="3200">entities that were roughly primate like</p>
<p t="1293360" d="5780">and so, territoriality and the proclivity to defend territory is so deeply embedded in us</p>
<p t="1300720" d="720">it's like,</p>
<p t="1303520" d="2560">the control center for our whole brain</p>
<p t="1306080" d="4720">and so, there isn't anything more important to us I would say than maintaining</p>
<p t="1311260" d="500">the</p>
<p t="1312840" d="1600">match between</p>
<p t="1314440" d="3500">what we want to have happen and what other people are doing</p>
<p t="1317940" d="3220">in response to our actions, like that's that, that's what we want</p>
<p t="1321740" d="2700">and as long match is maintained</p>
<p t="1324480" d="6080">then our emotional systems, and I would say that anxiety is probably primary in that regard</p>
<p t="1330740" d="2580">our emotional systems remain</p>
<p t="1334520" d="720">inhibited</p>
<p t="1336200" d="720">they're on</p>
<p t="1337380" d="960">they're ready</p>
<p t="1338600" d="2560">like a nuclear reactor rod are on</p>
<p t="1341220" d="3040">and the rest of the brain dampens them down but</p>
<p t="1345060" d="7000">it's like, you don't want them to take time to start up, man you want them to be on at a tenth of a seconds notice when it's necessary</p>
<p t="1352060" d="3600">and so, you know that's kind of why, well if you look at a wild animal</p>
<p t="1355880" d="1360">it's like, its alert</p>
<p t="1357240" d="3940">you know, it's ready to dart this way or that way, especially a pray animal</p>
<p t="1361780" d="2480">instantaneously and it has reflexes</p>
<p t="1364480" d="1760">built into it as you do</p>
<p t="1366240" d="2780">that will respond way before you're conscious</p>
<p t="1369020" d="840">So, for example</p>
<p t="1369980" d="7000">if you happened to be walking down a trail and you detect something snake like in the periphery, you will leap away</p>
<p t="1377060" d="3040">before even know that you leapt</p>
<p t="1380100" d="4260">and that's because it takes a fair bit of time to actually see a snake</p>
<p t="1384360" d="4040">by which I mean, form a conscious representation of the snake</p>
<p t="1388400" d="3300">you know, and maybe it takes a 1/4 of a second or something like that</p>
<p t="1391840" d="960">or even longer</p>
<p t="1393380" d="2720">but it doesn't matter, maybe it takes a tenth</p>
<p t="1396100" d="5800">a twentieth of a second, a tenth of a second but the thing about the damn snake is that it's way faster than that</p>
<p t="1401900" d="4240">it's really fast that thing and it co-evolved with primates by the way</p>
<p t="1406240" d="4880">and so it can nail you way faster that you can look at it so, you have</p>
<p t="1411500" d="5120">your eyes map snake like objects right onto your reflexes so that</p>
<p t="1416860" d="2240">the eyes go, the eyes make you jump</p>
<p t="1419440" d="4720">and then they see after that, yeah well now you can see that's no problem</p>
<p t="1425100" d="500">so</p>
<p t="1425980" d="560">alright</p>
<p t="1427640" d="560">alright</p>
<p t="1429280" d="4320">now what I would say that what we do is that we live in a shared story</p>
<p t="1433600" d="5380">and the story is a way of looking at the world and it's a way of acting in the world at the same time</p>
<p t="1438980" d="3600">and that story has to operate within narrow parameters</p>
<p t="1442580" d="2900">and this is something that is extraordinarily important to understand</p>
<p t="1445480" d="4440">because, and this is something I think that Piaget figured out, Jean Piaget</p>
<p t="1449920" d="3080">figured out, better that anyone else, I think that he really got this right and</p>
<p t="1453000" d="2800">by the way, one of the things that Piaget was trying to do</p>
<p t="1455800" d="3400">you never hear about how strange these great thinkers are</p>
<p t="1459200" d="2400">Piaget was a very strange guy and he was a</p>
<p t="1461600" d="2540">he was a hyper-genius, he was offered the</p>
<p t="1464140" d="4760">curatorship of a bloody museum when he was 10 years old, you know, because he wrote this little paper</p>
<p t="1468900" d="2420">on mollusks which apparently was very good and</p>
<p t="1471320" d="5120">so they offered him the curatorship of a museum and his parents wrote back and said, ";Well you know,</p>
<p t="1477040" d="2800">no, probably not because he is actually ten.";</p>
<p t="1479880" d="3120">and so that was Piaget, man, the guy was a genius</p>
<p t="1483000" d="5680">and, you know, he was actually motivated by the desire to reconcile science and religion</p>
<p t="1488880" d="2720">that was actually was his entire</p>
<p t="1491600" d="3920">motivation for what did, you never hear that but that is the case</p>
<p t="1496060" d="500">and so,</p>
<p t="1497180" d="2240">Piaget was very interested in how</p>
<p t="1499420" d="3700">you produce structures that enable you to regulate yourself</p>
<p t="1503120" d="1420">because you are kind of like a</p>
<p t="1504540" d="3940">a colony of strange sub-animals that have to figure out how to get along</p>
<p t="1508520" d="2240">so that you can sort of be one thing</p>
<p t="1510760" d="3360">you kind of learn that, I would say between the ages of 2 and 4</p>
<p t="1514120" d="4320">as you are being socialized, you know how erratic 2 years old's are, I mean they are a blast and</p>
<p t="1518440" d="2220">and it's part because they are erratic, it's like</p>
<p t="1520660" d="4640">they are unbelievably happy and then they are unbelievably hungry and then they really hot</p>
<p t="1525300" d="4160">and then they are really upset and crying, you know and then they are really scared, it's like</p>
<p t="1529460" d="5960">and all of that's just untrammeled so it's really fun to be around them, especially when they are happy, because they are just so happy</p>
<p t="1535420" d="1600">that it's just, you know</p>
<p t="1537020" d="1920">you don't ever get to be that happy</p>
<p t="1538940" d="4020">and so, it's nice to be around a 2 year old because you can kind of</p>
<p t="1542960" d="6020">feel that again, you know, and a lot of, one of the horrible things about being a parent is that you spend</p>
<p t="1549020" d="2160">a tremendous amount of your time</p>
<p t="1551420" d="1920">making your child less happy</p>
<p t="1553780" d="4400">and the reason for that is that positive emotion is very impulsive</p>
<p t="1558180" d="3220">you know, because everybody says well you should be happy, it's like</p>
<p t="1561400" d="3800">well, no, when you are happy you are actually quite stupid</p>
<p t="1565200" d="2540">and so, because happiness makes you impulsive,</p>
<p t="1567740" d="5480">happiness makes, happiness says, ";Hey, everything is   really good right now, get what you can while the getting is good!";</p>
<p t="1573640" d="500">and so,</p>
<p t="1574620" d="4320">as a, like if you are hyper-optimistic, manic we'll say</p>
<p t="1578940" d="3360">It's like every stock investment looks like a really good stock investment</p>
<p t="1582300" d="2360">and it's like, you go out and spend all your money because</p>
<p t="1584660" d="4280">look it, there's those wonderful things everywhere and you could do so great things with then, and then</p>
<p t="1589240" d="2240">you know, you spend all your money</p>
<p t="1591480" d="5460">and then, you crash and think, oh God, my life is over, you know because I just, I just</p>
<p t="1596960" d="6000">spent all my money on all this useless stuff and it's all under the grip of impulsive positive emotion</p>
<p t="1603340" d="1040">you know and so.</p>
<p t="1604720" d="3760">when you're telling your kids to be quiet and settle down</p>
<p t="1608640" d="3920">it isn't because they're making a lot of noise being in pain</p>
<p t="1612560" d="4000">it's because they are running around like wild baboons having a blast! And</p>
<p t="1616560" d="5380">disrupting things like mad,  you know and so, well kids, have to settle down, you know like,</p>
<p t="1622120" d="1600">";Quit having so much fun!";</p>
<p t="1623880" d="3760">and it's kind of awful that you do that but</p>
<p t="1628440" d="640">but you do</p>
<p t="1629320" d="1280">and that's because</p>
<p t="1630600" d="3520">the emotions and motivations have to be brought into</p>
<p t="1634240" d="3680">like a relationship with one another within the person</p>
<p t="1638120" d="1220">so that, you know</p>
<p t="1639340" d="2480">one thing I remember with my son who was quite</p>
<p t="1641820" d="1940">he is quite disagreeable by temperament</p>
<p t="1643760" d="4680">which is actually a good thing as far as I am concerned although it brings its own challenges</p>
<p t="1648720" d="4960">and so with my daughter when she was misbehaving, she was pretty agreeable</p>
<p t="1654640" d="500">and uh,</p>
<p t="1655380" d="4480">you know, if she was misbehaving I could basically just look at her</p>
<p t="1659860" d="3140">and she would just quit, you know, but my son, it was like</p>
<p t="1663000" d="4880">that was just nothing, you're looking at me, it's like, no that's just not going to go anywhere man</p>
<p t="1667880" d="2080">so then I would like tell him to stop, and</p>
<p t="1669960" d="2380">that really wasn't having much of an effect either</p>
<p t="1672340" d="2240">he would just sort of maybe laugh or run away</p>
<p t="1674600" d="3160">or whatever, he was a tough little rat, and</p>
<p t="1677760" d="2900">you know, what I would do with him, is that he would</p>
<p t="1680660" d="3900">be doing something and I would interfere and he would get upset, and you know</p>
<p t="1684560" d="5480">angry, and so then I would get him to sit on the steps and I told him, this was when he was about two</p>
<p t="1690040" d="3680">I said, look, you are going to sit on the steps, that's time out, you're going to sit of the steps</p>
<p t="1694020" d="4520">until you've got control of yourself, and you can come back and be</p>
<p t="1698800" d="2000">and play the family game again</p>
<p t="1700800" d="4080">I basically said, be a civilized human being and they you are welcome again</p>
<p t="1704880" d="3260">and so he would sit on the steps, it was so interesting to watch because</p>
<p t="1708140" d="2420">he was just enraged, he would sit there</p>
<p t="1710560" d="2340">like have you every seen a two year old have a temper tantrum?</p>
<p t="1712900" d="2280">It's really quite the bloody phenomena</p>
<p t="1715180" d="3500">if you ever saw an adult do that, you would like, you would call 911</p>
<p t="1718680" d="4120">right away, it's like oh my God! and I have seen adults do that, you know because</p>
<p t="1722800" d="4120">people, say, with borderline personality disorder will have temper tantrums and it's like</p>
<p t="1726920" d="5100">man, you want to about 30 feet away from that person, that's for sure, it's really, but</p>
<p t="1732260" d="1200">in kids, it's like</p>
<p t="1733460" d="3860">well first of all they are only this long, so how much trouble can they really cause</p>
<p t="1737320" d="3280">but it's like, you know they're just completely gone, they are like</p>
<p t="1740600" d="6120">on the floor, their face is red, they are just furious, like way more furious than you ever get</p>
<p t="1746720" d="2260">if you are even vaguely socialized</p>
<p t="1748980" d="4780">they are just outraged and they are kicking and hitting the ground and like, it's like a little</p>
<p t="1753760" d="5160">epileptic fit of anger you know , they are completely controlled by their rage and</p>
<p t="1758920" d="2300">we took care of one kid for a while who</p>
<p t="1761220" d="3880">he was actually a pushover, that kid, you could get him to behave by</p>
<p t="1765100" d="3580">you know, kind of shaking your finger at him, but, his mother thought he was really tough</p>
<p t="1768680" d="2520">because he had her fooled, he had her figured out</p>
<p t="1771200" d="3580">and one of the things he would do is have temper tantrums and during the temper tantrum</p>
<p t="1774800" d="3520">he would hold his bloody breath until he turned blue!</p>
<p t="1778320" d="3460">it's like try that, like you know as, that's your homework</p>
<p t="1781780" d="3940">go home and, go home and have a temper tantrum and while you are doing it hold your breath</p>
<p t="1785820" d="2340">until you actually turn blue</p>
<p t="1788160" d="1440">it's like, you won't be able to do it</p>
<p t="1789600" d="2000">you don't have the willpower of a two year old</p>
<p t="1791600" d="3320">that's for sure, that little varmint, man he would just have a fit</p>
<p t="1794920" d="4060">then he would hold his breath and then he would turn blue, it was like, Wow! that's, that's amazing</p>
<p t="1799480" d="2800">and we would just let him do it, and you know</p>
<p t="1802280" d="4620">he would turn blue and everybody would be gone and he would come out if it, you know, and</p>
<p t="1806900" d="5640">it didn't work, so he just quit doing it, I think he did it like twice, and then he figured out, oh well,</p>
<p t="1812540" d="4980">that's a lot of work for very little outcome, and you know it's not like two year old's are stupid, they're</p>
<p t="1817520" d="3100">they're not stupid, but they are probably smarter you</p>
<p t="1820620" d="4800">but they are not civilized, by any stretch of the imagination, and so, anyways back to my son</p>
<p t="1825420" d="4780">I would put him on the steps and he'd be like ";RRRRRR!";, just like enraged!</p>
<p t="1830200" d="2900">and, and trying to get himself together, you know</p>
<p t="1833260" d="3360">and I'd wait a few, like I had a strict rule which was</p>
<p t="1836800" d="2160">as soon as you are done</p>
<p t="1839200" d="1440">you're welcome again</p>
<p t="1840780" d="2960">so, it's completely under your control, you</p>
<p t="1843740" d="2520">you can get yourself calmed down, you come and talk to me again</p>
<p t="1846260" d="2140">if you are calm enough so I like you</p>
<p t="1848400" d="3020">then you are welcome back in the family, no grudge, nothing</p>
<p t="1851420" d="5320">and so, it's harder that you think, like people think that they like their kids, like don't be thinking that</p>
<p t="1856740" d="4560">they are hard to like, they are little monsters, and they are very very pushy and provocative</p>
<p t="1861300" d="2420">and so lots of their parents do not like their children</p>
<p t="1863720" d="3060">and they do terrible things to them their whole life</p>
<p t="1867020" d="2280">so, it's no joke, and uh,</p>
<p t="1869300" d="4420">it's very common and, you know, that was Freud's observation, fundamental observation, that</p>
<p t="1873720" d="4200">a lot of psychopathology is rooted in the family and you can be sure of that</p>
<p t="1877920" d="6460">you know and, when you hear about some mother who's done something terrible to her child, which happens reasonably frequently</p>
<p t="1884380" d="1320">you know perfectly well that</p>
<p t="1885700" d="4420">she has very terrible capacity to discipline, the child has just provoked her</p>
<p t="1890120" d="2600">and provoked her and provoked her and provoked her and provoked her</p>
<p t="1892720" d="1940">it just happens to be a day where</p>
<p t="1894660" d="4440">her new boyfriend left, and she is quite hungover and she got fired, and it's like</p>
<p t="1899760" d="2320">that's the wrong day to provoke her</p>
<p t="1902080" d="2140">and then she does something that is not good!</p>
<p t="1904220" d="4400">And you read about it and you think, ";Well how could that happen? How could anyone do that?"; Well</p>
<p t="1908740" d="1360">that's how they do it</p>
<p t="1910100" d="3920">and so, kids they are very provocative, just like little chimps</p>
<p t="1914320" d="800">chimps will</p>
<p t="1915900" d="5280">the adolescents will, like throw little pebbles and sticks at the sleeping larger males</p>
<p t="1921340" d="1360">and bug them</p>
<p t="1922700" d="2440">and that teasing, which it is, that teasing</p>
<p t="1925140" d="5580">turns into full fledged dominance challenge behaviour once the adolescent males get big enough to do it</p>
<p t="1930740" d="2880">and so when you are being provoked by a child, which</p>
<p t="1933620" d="3460">they provoke you all the time, they are trying to figure out well just,</p>
<p t="1937080" d="5300">";Where are you exactly, what happens if I do this? What happens if I do this?"; You know and</p>
<p t="1942380" d="1940">how else are they going to figure it out?</p>
<p t="1944320" d="2700">Anyways, he would sit on the steps and just</p>
<p t="1947020" d="5680">he is just enraged and trying to control himself and I would watch that and then you know I'd</p>
<p t="1952700" d="4240">come back after about two minutes or whatever and he would still be ";RRRRRRR!";</p>
<p t="1956940" d="3200">and I would say, well, you know, have you got yourself under control</p>
<p t="1960140" d="3640">are you ready to get of the steps? And he would go ";NOOOO! NOT YET!";</p>
<p t="1963780" d="3400">and then, you know, he would get himself under control</p>
<p t="1967180" d="3100">and then he would come back, and you know, he'd be contrite</p>
<p t="1970280" d="1940">and then I would like him right away, you know</p>
<p t="1972220" d="5280">you got to watch that, you know because, you don't like being dominated by a two year old, no one does</p>
<p t="1977620" d="2180">and so if the child hasn't</p>
<p t="1980240" d="5600">mastered himself and started to act in accordance with the prevailing social norms</p>
<p t="1985840" d="4880">you won't like them, well you think, ";Yeah I will because I am a good person.";, It's like, no you won't</p>
<p t="1990720" d="4020">and no you are not a good person so don't be thinking about that at all, it's just not true</p>
<p t="1994960" d="500">so</p>
<p t="1995460" d="5860">when he was contrite then he'd come and then, you know, we would just go on like nothing had happened</p>
<p t="2001320" d="3860">because that is what you want to do, right as soon as you get compliance</p>
<p t="2005180" d="2840">especially if the compliance is in the best interests of the child</p>
<p t="2008020" d="4100">you want to reward it instantly, right, that's the right thing to do</p>
<p t="2012120" d="780">because so then</p>
<p t="2014020" d="500">and</p>
<p t="2014520" d="5220">you could just see him gaining control over himself, and so what was really was happening is</p>
<p t="2020680" d="6560">His, in his mind, in his brain we'll say there was a war between the psyche, the ego that was starting</p>
<p t="2027240" d="5260">to become integrated, you know and starting to become a continuous person, an identity</p>
<p t="2032500" d="5100">and it is fragile in two year old's and it can be disrupted all the time, and it is, that's why they are so</p>
<p t="2037600" d="3020">hyper-emotional, it's fragile that little ego</p>
<p t="2040620" d="1300">and it doesn't have a lot of power</p>
<p t="2042480" d="3280">and so what you want to do is reward it when it wins!</p>
<p t="2045760" d="4020">You know, when it, he gets control over the underlying motivations you want to say</p>
<p t="2049780" d="2020">Hey, good work, man! Good work, kid!</p>
<p t="2051800" d="6080">You did it, you know, you got yourself under control, way to be! And the kid is really happy about that because</p>
<p t="2057880" d="2320">it's actually not that much fun to have a temper tantrum</p>
<p t="2060620" d="2960">It's exhausting, you know, it takes you over</p>
<p t="2063580" d="520">Question?</p>
<p t="2064100" d="3960">[Student] Could you give an example of what you would reward him with?</p>
<p t="2068500" d="5680">[JBP] Oh, just a pat on the head or, you know, ";That's good!"; kind words you know or whatever</p>
<p t="2074180" d="500">[Student] Notice it.</p>
<p t="2074680" d="4680">[JBP] Yeah, notice it pay attention, that's it, that's it, pay attention and that's a great</p>
<p t="2079360" d="3140">it's a great thing to know with people, like in your relationships</p>
<p t="2082500" d="3640">here is the key to a good relationship, it's not the only one but</p>
<p t="2086420" d="2420">Watch your person</p>
<p t="2088840" d="5520">carefully, carefully, carefully and whenever they do something that you would like them to do more of</p>
<p t="2094360" d="6080">tell them that that was really good and, mean it, and it's not manipulative, because if it's manipulative it won't work</p>
<p t="2100440" d="4080">It's like you have to say, ";Wow! I am so glad you did that!"; And you have to be precise</p>
<p t="2104520" d="2820">Here is what you just did that I though was great!</p>
<p t="2107340" d="4200">and then ";Oh boy, that's so nice that you noticed, I can't believe that noticed"; It's like</p>
<p t="2111540" d="2860">you know, you do that twenty times and the person will be</p>
<p t="2114400" d="3000">like the rat that's just pushing the lever for cocaine, you know</p>
<p t="2117400" d="5800">so but no, I'm serious, Skinner established this, B.F. Skinner noticed this a long time ago</p>
<p t="2123200" d="5880">Reward is intensely, useful in terms of modifying behaviour, but the problem is, is that</p>
<p t="2129080" d="3020">it's really hard to notice when things are going right.</p>
<p t="2132100" d="5400">Right, because you are kind of primed to notice when things are going wrong, and so you use</p>
<p t="2137840" d="2400">threat and punishment more often as</p>
<p t="2140560" d="6560">agents of shaping the people that you are around because, you know, when everything is going right</p>
<p t="2147120" d="3220">what are you going to say, everything is going right</p>
<p t="2150700" d="2320">it turns to zero, you just assume it</p>
<p t="2153020" d="1600">and that's, that's not good</p>
<p t="2154620" d="5280">that's not good, you want to pay attention and if your person, your children, your wife</p>
<p t="2160100" d="2060">whoever, your mother</p>
<p t="2162200" d="800">your sister</p>
<p t="2163820" d="1200">if you want them to</p>
<p t="2165400" d="7000">if you want to rectify your relationships with them, and I am not saying to do this in a manipulative way, it won't work</p>
<p t="2172400" d="4440">but if they do something that's promoting harmony and peace and goodwill, it's like</p>
<p t="2176840" d="3220">attend to it, tell them that you noticed, it's like</p>
<p t="2180060" d="4200">so useful and you have to get rid of grudges and your resentment to do that</p>
<p t="2184260" d="2620">right, because you don't want to, you are kind of mad at your sister</p>
<p t="2186880" d="4480">and then you know, she does something good, you think there is no goddamn way I am going to reward her for that</p>
<p t="2191360" d="2640">so you ignore her when she does something good, it's like</p>
<p t="2194000" d="4700">that's brilliant that is, because then you just punished her for doing what you want</p>
<p t="2198700" d="2700">and people do that with their kids all the time</p>
<p t="2201400" d="3920">you know, because they let the kids dominate them, then they get resentful</p>
<p t="2205320" d="4540">then the kid will run up to them to show them something that's kind of spectacular and they'll</p>
<p t="2210140" d="4160">they are not happy, they'll like, ";Oh yeah, that's, I'm working.";</p>
<p t="2214300" d="1320">You know, little kids</p>
<p t="2215840" d="3440">all sad about that and he has just learned something</p>
<p t="2219540" d="3200">so and it's not perhaps what you want him to learn</p>
<p t="2222900" d="4640">and so you have to keep your relationship with your children pristine</p>
<p t="2227540" d="1780">and that means that you can't</p>
<p t="2229320" d="5180">hold a grudge or resent them and that means that you have to help them learn how to behave</p>
<p t="2234680" d="1360">so that you like them</p>
<p t="2236300" d="2820">and that way, if you like them</p>
<p t="2239120" d="5160">and you are kind of sensible, and maybe your partner also likes them, so, you know, you have got a consensus going there</p>
<p t="2244280" d="3940">there is a reasonable possibility that other people will actually like them too</p>
<p t="2248220" d="3760">including other children and then the world open up to them</p>
<p t="2251980" d="5760">you know, then you'll bring them to peoples houses and the people will actually smile at them</p>
<p t="2257740" d="4320">and give them a pat on the head instead of thinking, ";Oh my God that brats coming to visit again</p>
<p t="2262060" d="1600">I wonder what he will break this time.";</p>
<p t="2264040" d="5600">You know and that's just a horrible thing for your child to experience repetitively</p>
<p t="2269800" d="2000">in situation after situation</p>
<p t="2271800" d="5100">all they learn is that adults have a false smile but they are really lying all the time</p>
<p t="2277200" d="500">God!</p>
<p t="2277700" d="5440">It's like a bit of hell and there's a lot of children who are trapped in that, it's really awful to see</p>
<p t="2283140" d="3680">I can see kids like that when I walk down the street, you know, it's like</p>
<p t="2287060" d="7000">they are little doomed things and they're,  they are, you know, they are screwed in 15 different ways and there is no way out of it</p>
<p t="2294060" d="960">It's really awful</p>
<p t="2295540" d="500">so,</p>
<p t="2296040" d="2340">I would not recommend that you do that</p>
<p t="2298380" d="2380">It's better to notice that you are a bit of a monster</p>
<p t="2301480" d="1280">or a lot of a monster</p>
<p t="2303100" d="1040">and notice that</p>
<p t="2304140" d="4820">you are much happier with the people around you when they behave in accordance with</p>
<p t="2308960" d="5320">reasonable social norms and then you actually feel genuinely connected to them</p>
<p t="2314280" d="3440">you want to work on their behalf so that everything works out</p>
<p t="2317720" d="3620">but if you think that you are a good person and that you would never do anything that was</p>
<p t="2321340" d="6040">harmful to your children then you can just forget about that because you will never take it seriously enough to actually learn</p>
<p t="2327700" d="500">so,</p>
<p t="2328820" d="4220">alright, so anyways we live inside this story as far as I can tell</p>
<p t="2333040" d="500">and</p>
<p t="2333540" d="3480">you know we kind of put the story together inside us to begin with</p>
<p t="2337020" d="2580">and that happens between 2 and 4 when you are</p>
<p t="2339660" d="5540">integrating those motivations and emotions into a relatively functional unity</p>
<p t="2345500" d="3600">right, and that does happen between 2 and 4</p>
<p t="2349100" d="4300">if you don't have your kids socialized by the time they are 4, you might as well just forget it</p>
<p t="2353400" d="5040">and I know that sounds terribly pessimistic and all of that but I know the literature on</p>
<p t="2358440" d="6640">trying to rectify antisocial behaviour in children, and after the age of 4 it's virtually impossible no matter what you do.</p>
<p t="2365080" d="1620">and the reason for that is that</p>
<p t="2366700" d="3640">kids who are still acting like two year old's when they are four</p>
<p t="2370580" d="3360">you know, they are twice as old, eh, as a two year old</p>
<p t="2373940" d="5160">that's a lot of difference, like a four year old is an adult as far as a two year old is concerned</p>
<p t="2379100" d="4360">and so if the four year old is still acting like a two year old, that's really not good!</p>
<p t="2383460" d="2500">and other four year old's will come up and, you know</p>
<p t="2385960" d="9460">do a little play invitation, like a dog, and you know, the kid, the two year old four year old has no idea how to react to that and so the more mature kid thinks</p>
<p t="2395800" d="560">";Oh, well..</p>
<p t="2396360" d="2100">how about I play with you?"; [motions to another student]</p>
<p t="2398740" d="1920">and then that kid is isolated</p>
<p t="2400980" d="4320">from the peers and after four you mostly socialized by your peers</p>
<p t="2405300" d="2800">and so you just fall farther and farther and farther behind</p>
<p t="2408100" d="4120">you are more and more alienated, you are more bitter and angry and no wonder</p>
<p t="2412420" d="3300">and it's just not, you can't rectify it</p>
<p t="2415920" d="500">so,</p>
<p t="2417320" d="500">so,</p>
<p t="2417840" d="3920">so that's useful to know, it's like your job from two to four</p>
<p t="2421760" d="6120">is to turn your child, help turn your child into a functional unity, and by three they should be</p>
<p t="2428400" d="1920">functional enough as a unity</p>
<p t="2430400" d="4940">within themselves so that they can concentrate on a voluntary goal</p>
<p t="2435340" d="2020">for some reasonable length of time</p>
<p t="2437360" d="5500">which is also why it's useful to let them spend some time alone, so that they can learn to amuse themselves</p>
<p t="2442860" d="3140">because if they can't amuse themselves they are not going to play with other kids</p>
<p t="2446440" d="1120">and then by three</p>
<p t="2447560" d="3200">they are sorted together enough so if another three year old comes along</p>
<p t="2451000" d="2320">they can at least play in parallel</p>
<p t="2453600" d="4820">and may also start, maybe able to start playing</p>
<p t="2459100" d="1680">a cooperative game</p>
<p t="2460780" d="3340">and so, that's often a fantasy game, you know, pretend</p>
<p t="2464120" d="3720">and so what the kids will do, sometimes they mediate it verbally</p>
<p t="2468420" d="2240">but sometimes it's more acted out</p>
<p t="2470660" d="1140">it's a combination of the two</p>
<p t="2471800" d="1960">they will assign each other roles</p>
<p t="2473760" d="2760">they will do this with you too, well let's have a tea party</p>
<p t="2476520" d="1520">well, what does that mean?</p>
<p t="2478260" d="5380">well it means let's sit down and act out the act of sharing food</p>
<p t="2483640" d="1780">and see if we can get that right</p>
<p t="2485420" d="2500">that's what the kids saying we will have a little tea party</p>
<p t="2487920" d="5140">you know, it's very important, because human beings share food, like this is a major thing to get right, man.</p>
<p t="2493060" d="4400">And so, the kid will say well you be the Mom and I will be the Dad and, you know,</p>
<p t="2497460" d="3920">we will make little fort and that will be our house and we will go in there and run our roles and</p>
<p t="2501380" d="1360">you know, we are acting out</p>
<p t="2503000" d="2280">we are acting out family</p>
<p t="2505660" d="6000">and if we are both reasonably civilized as three year old's we can concentrate on that goal</p>
<p t="2511660" d="2660">we can establish that little fictional world</p>
<p t="2514920" d="1140">we can</p>
<p t="2516260" d="1920">negotiate a mutual goal</p>
<p t="2518180" d="4000">and then we can run the simulation and that is what kids are doing when they are pretending</p>
<p t="2522180" d="2380">it's bloody brilliant, that's play man, it's like</p>
<p t="2525320" d="1120">It's brilliant!</p>
<p t="2526440" d="2600">It's absolutely unbelievable because</p>
<p t="2529040" d="3060">you know, if you are going to play Mom, let's say</p>
<p t="2532560" d="1120">It isn't like you</p>
<p t="2534180" d="4640">it isn't exactly like you imitate your Mom because imitation would be</p>
<p t="2538820" d="2520">you know how annoying it is when someone copies you</p>
<p t="2541480" d="1020">so, you know</p>
<p t="2542500" d="1380">you are sitting like that and then</p>
<p t="2543880" d="4260">and I do the same thing, that's really annoying and that isn't what kids do</p>
<p t="2549240" d="940">they don't</p>
<p t="2550620" d="5840">act out the precise actions that they have seen the target of their fantasy</p>
<p t="2556920" d="3440">display, they're way more sophisticated than that, they watch</p>
<p t="2560360" d="2520">they're mother, let's say, like hawks</p>
<p t="2562880" d="5620">and then they start to extract out the regularities in their behaviour, which is Mom behaviour, let's say</p>
<p t="2568500" d="1140">that's what makes you Mom</p>
<p t="2569800" d="2000">whatever that is, and then</p>
<p t="2571800" d="5880">so it's like they look at you across time and they extract out the regularity that makes you Mother</p>
<p t="2577680" d="6080">and then they try to embody that regularity in their pretend play and then they sort of encapsulate or</p>
<p t="2583760" d="3900">incorporate the spirit of being a mother, or being a father or whatever</p>
<p t="2587660" d="2120">or an animal because they'll play at that</p>
<p t="2589780" d="4740">and so that is what they are doing, they are using their body as, and their mind as dramatic forums</p>
<p t="2594520" d="3000">it's really amazing, you know it's so sophisticated</p>
<p t="2597680" d="2960">and no other animal does that as far as we know</p>
<p t="2600640" d="4160">and it's the platform on which language is based, first of all we imitate</p>
<p t="2604800" d="5580">and language is imitation, right, because we use the same words, right, so it's imitation</p>
<p t="2610380" d="2920">it's a big deal so you can act out someone else</p>
<p t="2613300" d="4240">and then you can conceptualize them in fantasy and it is only way after that that you</p>
<p t="2617540" d="2940">could maybe articulate it, what does it mean to be a mother</p>
<p t="2620480" d="1940">so I could have you write an essay about that</p>
<p t="2622420" d="2200">well you would have to think about it right?</p>
<p t="2624620" d="5520">you wouldn't just automatically know, but if someone hands you a baby, you know, you are not completely</p>
<p t="2630760" d="6160">socially blind, you roughly know what to do after you are done with your initial nervousness</p>
<p t="2636920" d="1560">you roughly know what to do</p>
<p t="2638480" d="4300">don't drop it, that's a good rule you have probably figured that one out at least</p>
<p t="2642780" d="4960">you know, don't yell at it, don't startle it, give it a little pat maybe, try hugging it</p>
<p t="2647740" d="3940">maybe you go like this, you know, you make eyes at it, you know what to do!</p>
<p t="2651680" d="2980">It's built into you, you know, it's built into you, but</p>
<p t="2654660" d="4300">that doesn't mean you could lay it out as a series of rules about how to be a mother</p>
<p t="2658960" d="3320">it's like you could right a whole damn book about that, so</p>
<p t="2662280" d="2740">alright, so anyways, you live in this story</p>
<p t="2665020" d="2940">and first of all you get your own story together</p>
<p t="2667960" d="3800">and that's by integrating your motivations and emotions together</p>
<p t="2672160" d="1600">under social influence</p>
<p t="2673760" d="560">you know,</p>
<p t="2675180" d="2180">Piaget kind of states that</p>
<p t="2677380" d="3040">before the age of three kids can't really play</p>
<p t="2680760" d="3760">they are egocentric, and it's not exactly right because</p>
<p t="2684520" d="1980">you are actually playing with you mother</p>
<p t="2686500" d="4640">from the time you are born, so even with breast feeding that's a social interaction and</p>
<p t="2691140" d="4840">it's a complex cooperative endeavour and it's often hard for a mother and the infant</p>
<p t="2696220" d="1120">to get that right</p>
<p t="2697340" d="6340">because it's complicated and it requires a lot of social interaction, like the child has to learn not to bite for example</p>
<p t="2703680" d="3180">you know and a mother has to learn not to be too nervous and</p>
<p t="2706860" d="3600">and there is a lot of social bonding, it's a really complicated social interaction</p>
<p t="2710460" d="2540">so the child, the infant even at the earliest stages</p>
<p t="2713200" d="4040">is already engaged in a complex social dynamic</p>
<p t="2717240" d="2220">that is essentially play oriented</p>
<p t="2719620" d="4960">but it's you know pretty primordial , it has to do mostly with the mouth, and</p>
<p t="2725020" d="4000">a child's mouth and tongue are already hardwired at birth  so</p>
<p t="2729020" d="4880">you child is most, this is a Freudian observation as well, your child is almost all</p>
<p t="2733900" d="4540">mouth and tongue when it's born, the rest of it's body, well you watch infants , it's like</p>
<p t="2739120" d="1200">even when they are</p>
<p t="2741200" d="560">How old?</p>
<p t="2741760" d="6160">Seven months? Six months? Four months? I can't even remember now, you know, they will move their arm and they kind of go like this</p>
<p t="2748040" d="2960">it's like they have no fine control, they're</p>
<p t="2751000" d="1460">it's more like they have</p>
<p t="2752460" d="3040">you know clubs on the ends of sticks, it's like that</p>
<p t="2755700" d="1840">their nervous system isn't</p>
<p t="2757540" d="3480">thoroughly myleinated, then don't have control over themseleves</p>
<p t="2761020" d="2760">but their mouth and tongue are already wired up</p>
<p t="2763780" d="3680">and so, otherwise they wouldn't be able to swallow or nurse, so</p>
<p t="2767460" d="3720">the oral element is extraordinarily important for a young child</p>
<p t="2771180" d="1840">that's why kids put everything in their mouth</p>
<p t="2773020" d="4140">you know, even when they are a bit older it's like they see with their tongue</p>
<p t="2777160" d="1460">which of course everyone can do</p>
<p t="2778620" d="6580">you know if you put a block in your mouth you can tell that it's a cube, you can tell that it is a cube without looking</p>
<p t="2785200" d="5560">so you can with your tongue, you can see with your hands, you can even see to some degree with your ears</p>
<p t="2791520" d="640">anyways,</p>
<p t="2792160" d="5000">so they're a social interaction right from the beginning, but for the point of simplification</p>
<p t="2797160" d="1420">you might say well first the child</p>
<p t="2798720" d="1120">organizes</p>
<p t="2799900" d="2880">themselves into a functional unity under the</p>
<p t="2803000" d="1920">pressure of social dynamics</p>
<p t="2804920" d="4320">and then they get unified enough so that they can attain unity with another child by</p>
<p t="2809240" d="1780">setting up a fictional world</p>
<p t="2811020" d="5060">and cooperating and competing within that, because that's quite interesting to because</p>
<p t="2816360" d="1520">you know, people often</p>
<p t="2817880" d="3440">juxtapose cooperation and competition as if they are opposites</p>
<p t="2821320" d="1680">but they are not opposites at all</p>
<p t="2823000" d="2000">another Piagetian observation</p>
<p t="2825000" d="2400">so you say, ";Well is hockey a competitive game?";</p>
<p t="2827400" d="4000">and people would say, ";Well yeah!"; but then you think, really!</p>
<p t="2831880" d="2800">Really! No one brings a basketball</p>
<p t="2835120" d="500">Right?</p>
<p t="2836000" d="2320">So, we are going to play by the rules</p>
<p t="2838320" d="3720">That's cooperation, well are teams competing against each other</p>
<p t="2842040" d="3940">Well yes! But they agreed to compete within a particular landscape</p>
<p t="2846080" d="3840">and they all cooperate to maintain that landscape, and so</p>
<p t="2849920" d="2300">you do the same thing when you are playing Monopoly</p>
<p t="2852220" d="3140">It's like you are trying to win but at the same time you are cooperating</p>
<p t="2855540" d="4160">That's what, that's society man! That's society right there!</p>
<p t="2859700" d="1180">You are cooperating</p>
<p t="2862400" d="5120">That's the big enclosure, and within that there are regulated competitions</p>
<p t="2867520" d="6280">But, to separate those artificially and say one is competition and the other is cooperation is just</p>
<p t="2875300" d="5200">It's just not. just not very smart, it's not observant, that's not how it workd</p>
<p t="2881200" d="5600">and games are intensely cooperative even if they are intensely competitive, I mean</p>
<p t="2886800" d="4800">the  hockey teams are playing in the same game, that's the cooperation, then each team</p>
<p t="2891600" d="5400">there is competition within the team to be the best player, let's say, but everyone wants that</p>
<p t="2897000" d="6520">because everyone wants good players to emerge, but still cooperate like mad with your team mates and if you don't pass</p>
<p t="2903520" d="5620">and you know, play like a reasonable person then, they're going to not be happy with you</p>
<p t="2909420" d="1140">and so,</p>
<p t="2910560" d="5200">even within that competition, cooperation is regulating the interactions and then you can think</p>
<p t="2915760" d="2660">this is a really good thing to think too, it's like</p>
<p t="2918940" d="2080">People often say to their kids,</p>
<p t="2922680" d="2520">doesn't matter whether you win or lose, it's how you play the game.</p>
<p t="2925200" d="5080">and the kid of course has no idea what that means, it's like what do you mean, I am trying to win</p>
<p t="2930280" d="3480">and the parents says, ";No, no, it matters how you play";</p>
<p t="2933760" d="4500">and the kid pushes them and the parents really can't come up with a good explanation of why that is the case</p>
<p t="2938260" d="1880">They might say, ";Well other kids won't play with you";</p>
<p t="2941180" d="880">There you go!</p>
<p t="2942480" d="1520">Because you could say,</p>
<p t="2945720" d="2400">this is something to think about, so</p>
<p t="2949000" d="960">there is a game</p>
<p t="2950340" d="2480">and there is a victory within the game</p>
<p t="2953300" d="2200">but then there is the set of all games</p>
<p t="2955620" d="3120">and there is victory across the set of all games</p>
<p t="2958740" d="3660">and the victory that you attain across the set of all games</p>
<p t="2962420" d="1840">isn't winning all the games</p>
<p t="2964260" d="2480">it's being invited to play all the games</p>
<p t="2967160" d="2220">and so if you play fair</p>
<p t="2969980" d="2160">then you are playing a meta-game</p>
<p t="2972140" d="3480">and the meta-game is how to win across the set of all games</p>
<p t="2975620" d="4720">and so if you teach your child how to behave properly then they always get invited to play</p>
<p t="2980600" d="1840">and that makes them winners</p>
<p t="2982640" d="1120">and that's that!</p>
<p t="2983760" d="3240">and so if you understand that  you understand something</p>
<p t="2987100" d="4000">phenomenally important about the emergence of morality</p>
<p t="2991100" d="5100">you know because people, moral relativist in particular think that morality is relative</p>
<p t="2997180" d="4800">and of course human beings are diverse, just like languages are diverse</p>
<p t="3001980" d="5140">and there is more than one playable game but there is not really more than one playable meta-game</p>
<p t="3007120" d="4180">it's like you are either the kind of person that other people want to play with</p>
<p t="3011480" d="960">or you are not.</p>
<p t="3012440" d="3900">and it you are not the kind of person that people want to play with then you are a loser</p>
<p t="3016340" d="2180">it's as simple as that, and that's</p>
<p t="3018520" d="4240">true of all cultures, they might be playing different individual games</p>
<p t="3022760" d="3040">within their culture and undoubtedly they are, but</p>
<p t="3025800" d="6500">the set of all games that they play is still common across cultures, that's part of what makes us human</p>
<p t="3032300" d="1600">and then you could say as well</p>
<p t="3034200" d="6160">we are actually evolved to detect people who are good at playing the set of all possible games</p>
<p t="3040360" d="4180">and we actually know that, that's not theoretical, we know for example</p>
<p t="3044540" d="3800">some things are easy to remember and some things are to remember, you know</p>
<p t="3048340" d="3720">Here is something that is easy to remember, you play with someone and they cheat</p>
<p t="3052060" d="5360">Man, you will remember that, that's like in your mind, that's not going anywhere</p>
<p t="3057580" d="4020">and so great are detecting cheaters and you remember</p>
<p t="3061600" d="6000">and that's because you can't trust a cheater and you shouldn't invite a cheater to play a game with you because they might cheat!</p>
<p t="3067600" d="6720">and so, that's part of the innate morality system, you remember cheaters because they good at playing the meta-game</p>
<p t="3074320" d="1540">and of course you're evolved</p>
<p t="3075860" d="3240">of course you are adapted to the meta-game because</p>
<p t="3079100" d="3820">you are the product of this immense evolutionary history right and</p>
<p t="3083040" d="1920">whoever your ancestors were</p>
<p t="3085040" d="5600">which is an unbroken string of successful reproducers going back 3.5 billion years</p>
<p t="3090640" d="3020">you think about that, every single one of your ancestors</p>
<p t="3093680" d="5120">successfully reproduced, it's mind boggling that you chances against that</p>
<p t="3098920" d="4680">are so, it's billions to one and here you are the line of</p>
<p t="3103820" d="8520">3.5 billion years of success, the whole world was trying to kill you, that whole time and here you are, it's like, and but</p>
<p t="3112340" d="2940">you know, you are still only going to last about 80 years</p>
<p t="3115340" d="500">so,</p>
<p t="3115840" d="3700">but that, you know, is still, you know good for you, so anyways</p>
<p t="3119580" d="5900">there were lots of games that your ancestors were playing across that immense span of time</p>
<p t="3125780" d="5040">many, many you know, lizard games and tree dweller games</p>
<p t="3133040" d="3760">and crustacean games, you know the huge set of games</p>
<p t="3137480" d="3760">and you are adapted to win across those games, all of them</p>
<p t="3141240" d="5120">and that's built into you, man, that's your central human nature, that's what makes you social</p>
<p t="3146640" d="3580">and it's not some mere cultural construct</p>
<p t="3150400" d="5440">quite the contrary, it's so deeply embedded in you, it's what you are</p>
<p t="3156140" d="1660">Alright, so well</p>
<p t="3157800" d="6420">this is a story, it's a game too, that's another way of thinking about it, you know, that's a Monopoly game, well</p>
<p t="3165060" d="1120">what's the frame</p>
<p t="3166300" d="2160">well that's the rules of the game</p>
<p t="3168500" d="2320">and are they, why do you accept them</p>
<p t="3170820" d="2580">Well, it's kind of arbitrary right, it's like</p>
<p t="3173400" d="2900">that happens to be the rules, hockey has different rules</p>
<p t="3176300" d="4000">basketball has different rules, but what they share is that they have rules</p>
<p t="3180300" d="4760">OK, so there is a frame, that's the rules, and then within the frame there is a goal</p>
<p t="3185060" d="4340">and the goal is whatever the rules dictate, you know there is usually</p>
<p t="3189400" d="2540">It's usually the construction of a heirarchy</p>
<p t="3192080" d="2880">of success within a frame</p>
<p t="3194960" d="5220">and so that's what you play, and so you play Monopoly, and it's like, we'll accept the rules</p>
<p t="3200180" d="1980">that's the social contract and then we will each try to win</p>
<p t="3202160" d="1160">and that will be fun!</p>
<p t="3203800" d="3520">We find that amusing, and if you lose, what do you say?</p>
<p t="3207320" d="2320">Well, you say there is always another game</p>
<p t="3210000" d="1600">and so that's great,, so</p>
<p t="3211600" d="5380">if you have that attitude and you play fair, then it doesn't matter whether you win or lose</p>
<p t="3216980" d="3680">although you still want to try to win because otherwise you are not a good player</p>
<p t="3220660" d="1940">but you accept defeat gracefully because</p>
<p t="3222920" d="1280">you can play again!</p>
<p t="3224200" d="4520">and so, and you will win some and you will lose some and that's not so bad, you know and</p>
<p t="3228760" d="3680">even if you lose, well maybe you learned something,  and</p>
<p t="3232440" d="4660">and you're doing a lot more than one thing while you are playing Monopoly, you know, you are having a conversation and</p>
<p t="3237100" d="3820">learning how to interact with people, and learning how to regulate your emotions and so</p>
<p t="3240920" d="2620">even if you lose if you have any sense you win</p>
<p t="3243540" d="2580">and if your kids have any sense they know that</p>
<p t="3246120" d="4960">and so, that way you buffer then against defeat, it's like yeah, yeah, you know</p>
<p t="3252180" d="640">next time</p>
<p t="3253820" d="500">it's OK</p>
<p t="3255300" d="1900">You should try but it is OK</p>
<p t="3257400" d="1880">and, and that's</p>
<p t="3259900" d="2560">useful information for people to know</p>
<p t="3262760" d="500">so,</p>
<p t="3263260" d="4420">alright, so you are always in one of these little frameworks and there is just no getting out of it, so</p>
<p t="3267680" d="2520">and that's because, you know at any given moment</p>
<p t="3270200" d="6360">this is like field theory, there used to be psychological theories that talked about the field of human experiance</p>
<p t="3276560" d="3600">something like that, and this is kind of what that is, this is a field and</p>
<p t="3280160" d="3480">basically what happens is that you parse out a little part of the world</p>
<p t="3284100" d="500">say</p>
<p t="3285260" d="500">and</p>
<p t="3286660" d="1920">an amount that you can handle</p>
<p t="3288580" d="4300">so let's say it has some duration , you are not aiming at something 50 years in the future</p>
<p t="3292880" d="1880">it's because how the hell are you going to to that?</p>
<p t="3294760" d="1800">there are too many variables, you know</p>
<p t="3297060" d="3360">so, your aiming at some handleable amount of time</p>
<p t="3300560" d="4000">and you posit a goal in there and you plot your route and then,</p>
<p t="3304600" d="1600">that tells you what is up</p>
<p t="3306200" d="4860">and tells you what is down, because up moves you towards the goal and down moves you away from the goal and</p>
<p t="3311060" d="2500">that's sets up your motivation framework so that</p>
<p t="3313560" d="4900">you have something worth attaining, you know that's a really interesting thing to know too, it's like</p>
<p t="3318900" d="1320">Why have a goal?</p>
<p t="3320660" d="3040">Well it's easy, no goal, no positive emotion.</p>
<p t="3323700" d="5540">Because you experience positive emotion by noticing that you are moving towards a goal</p>
<p t="3329400" d="1920">and so if you don't have a goal</p>
<p t="3331360" d="3040">well you can't have any positive emotion! So,</p>
<p t="3334400" d="4200">you better have a goal, and so you might say well what should the goal be?</p>
<p t="3338600" d="3820">Well we could start by saying, well, any goal is better than none.</p>
<p t="3342420" d="3080">And then we might say well it should be a goal that other people</p>
<p t="3345500" d="3600">will let you pursue, because otherwise it's going to be kind of difficult</p>
<p t="3349100" d="3980">and maybe they will be even happy to help you pursue it, that would even be better</p>
<p t="3353080" d="3840">and maybe it's a goal that would enable you to learn how to pursue other goals</p>
<p t="3356980" d="3920">while you pursue that goal, boy, that would really be good,</p>
<p t="3360900" d="3380">And so, you can see that your goal was parameterized</p>
<p t="3364280" d="5040">but that doesn't mean that any old goal works, it means there's some goals that work nicely</p>
<p t="3369320" d="5600">and some not so nicely, there are playable games and non-playable games, that's a good way of thinking about it</p>
<p t="3374920" d="3000">and you want to have a playable game, and there is a lot of them</p>
<p t="3378260" d="2360">lawyer, plumber, you know</p>
<p t="3381100" d="3200">actor, whatever, they are playable games</p>
<p t="3384740" d="2640">and it's not obvious which one is better but</p>
<p t="3387380" d="4000">it's certainly obvious which ones are sustainable and which ones are worse</p>
<p t="3391380" d="5360">and so they're is a set of playable games and you need to extract from that set of playable games</p>
<p t="3396740" d="1120">a game that suits you.</p>
<p t="3397860" d="5820">and that would be partly due to your temperament, you know, because extroverted people want to play an extroverted game</p>
<p t="3403680" d="2920">highly neurotic people want to play a safe game</p>
<p t="3406600" d="3080">agreeable people want to play generous game and</p>
<p t="3409680" d="4360">disagreeable people want to play a game that highly competitive so they can win, and</p>
<p t="3414080" d="1180">you know, fine!</p>
<p t="3415420" d="1280">but they're all</p>
<p t="3417200" d="2080">within the realm of playable games</p>
<p t="3419280" d="2380">and that means they are socially acceptable as well</p>
<p t="3421960" d="2640">and so, that means, it isn't just</p>
<p t="3425380" d="2920">arbitrary , it isn't just relative</p>
<p t="3428300" d="3840">what you decide to do, it is heavily parameterized, there is only</p>
<p t="3432980" d="4240">there is a set of playable games, and it's large, the set is large but</p>
<p t="3437220" d="4440">there are commonalities within it, and that's why there are commonalties</p>
<p t="3442240" d="2560">that is why morality has a common basis</p>
<p t="3444800" d="3320">fundamentally, and so that's partly what we are trying to investigate, it's like</p>
<p t="3448680" d="2160">what's up, what is up mean?</p>
<p t="3451020" d="2880">what does it mean, is there such a thing, now</p>
<p t="3454240" d="2360">one thing to remember is that</p>
<p t="3456600" d="4440">if you don't erect a hierarchical structure with something to aim at</p>
<p t="3461360" d="2080">you got no positive motivation</p>
<p t="3463440" d="6360">because, you experience positive motivation in relationship to a goal, not from attaining the goal</p>
<p t="3469800" d="2700">that's satisfaction, besides it's fleeting</p>
<p t="3472500" d="4940">you know perfectly well, you graduate from university, poof! Next day you have a problem</p>
<p t="3477680" d="3600">which is what do you do next, and that's a tough problem</p>
<p t="3481280" d="3400">it's not like you solved your problems by winning that game</p>
<p t="3484680" d="3120">you just introduced the problem of having to introduce another game!</p>
<p t="3487800" d="5860">so it's unreliable as a source of positive emotion, but what's reliable is, you set a goal.</p>
<p t="3494160" d="1520">and you try to attain it</p>
<p t="3495960" d="3140">and then that gives your life, literally</p>
<p t="3499100" d="1860">provides your life with meaning</p>
<p t="3501320" d="4560">that's what meaning is, now it's more than that, but that's what it is</p>
<p t="3505880" d="1640">and so then you might ask yourself, well</p>
<p t="3508140" d="2580">What's a really good goal?</p>
<p t="3510720" d="3880">Well, that's what we are trying to figure out, what's a really good goal? And now,</p>
<p t="3514600" d="4320">OK, so you got that, so now I am going to walk through, at least partly through</p>
<p t="3518920" d="5440">we will see how far we get, I am going to walk through Pinocchio with you because that is what the movie is about, and</p>
<p t="3524940" d="500">it's a</p>
<p t="3525440" d="4540">it's hard to say how it come about, like it was written, the story, by a guy named</p>
<p t="3530220" d="3120">Collodi, [spells it]</p>
<p t="3533340" d="4700">it's quite a bit different, the story, that story, the written one from the Disney version</p>
<p t="3538040" d="3120">the Disney version was a product of the collaboration of</p>
<p t="3541160" d="4580">geniuses of animation, essentially, so they were artistic geniuses</p>
<p t="3545740" d="2940">great at capturing motion and emotion and all of that</p>
<p t="3549480" d="1680">they were stellar at that</p>
<p t="3551320" d="5200">and imaginative, tremendously imaginative, but collectively imaginative</p>
<p t="3556520" d="2580">and so they put together a collective product</p>
<p t="3559100" d="3680">and you might say well how did they do that exactly, it's like well</p>
<p t="3562960" d="3920">they were good storytellers, and what does that mean, well</p>
<p t="3567120" d="4240">it means you know the story that works and the story that doesn't</p>
<p t="3571360" d="4640">and maybe partly what you do is you kind of think out a story, and you think, well what is this happened?</p>
<p t="3576400" d="4720">Well, maybe this should happen?  Oh! That's the thing! That would work!</p>
<p t="3581120" d="2380">It's like a little flash of inspiration, right it's like</p>
<p t="3583500" d="3620">you got a piece of the puzzle that fits, you think, That will work there!</p>
<p t="3587120" d="4820">and then you talk to the other people and you generate ideas and someone says, What if?</p>
<p t="3591940" d="5040">What if they do this? And then everyone goes, No, no that's just not believable, no ones going to buy that.</p>
<p t="3596980" d="5060">and someone else has a little revelation, they say, Well, you know, it makes some sense somehow if,</p>
<p t="3602040" d="3020">if they do this! And then everybody goes, Oh yeah! That really</p>
<p t="3605500" d="1280">that really works!</p>
<p t="3607080" d="1040">It's like, why?</p>
<p t="3608820" d="960">Why? why?</p>
<p t="3610100" d="3120">Well you don't know, you don't know why it works</p>
<p t="3613500" d="1280">but it works because</p>
<p t="3615560" d="3100">It works because it's the right story</p>
<p t="3618660" d="1460">and so what does that mean?</p>
<p t="3620400" d="3600">well it's kind of associated with this meta-game idea</p>
<p t="3624000" d="4580">you know, there is a story that you should be acting out that works across games</p>
<p t="3628580" d="4360">and you have an inkling of it, you have notion of it, you have a vague apprehension of it</p>
<p t="3632940" d="3020">it's sort of built into you, that's an archetype, that's an archetype</p>
<p t="3635960" d="5380">and so when you read a story that works you are just entranced by it, and you all know that</p>
<p t="3641340" d="4000">You go to a movie and it's a great movie and you are just blown away, you know it's</p>
<p t="3645480" d="1860">a movie can pull you in</p>
<p t="3647340" d="5360">and turn you into one of the screen characters and, like, run you through a huge set of emotions.</p>
<p t="3652700" d="1400">I saw this movie once about</p>
<p t="3654100" d="5540">South America, it started with this guy running out of a subway, naked, and he didn't know where he was</p>
<p t="3659640" d="1560">and it turned out that he had been</p>
<p t="3661200" d="1360">absconded by</p>
<p t="3662560" d="4780">the totalitarian death squads and he couldn't remember anything about himself, and</p>
<p t="3667520" d="2000">he went back to his village and</p>
<p t="3670220" d="4720">basically what happened was that, he ended up back in the totalitarian</p>
<p t="3675260" d="1640">death grip.</p>
<p t="3677220" d="3140">and it showed how the fascist state</p>
<p t="3680360" d="2760">had saturated the village completely, and,</p>
<p t="3683340" d="3840">so it was a tragedy and you could see with every action that</p>
<p t="3687580" d="5300">this amnestic guy as he recreated himself and remembered his identity</p>
<p t="3692880" d="3920">was going to travel down exactly the same road because nothing had changed</p>
<p t="3696800" d="5660">and by the time, I wish, I have looked what that movie was for years, I've never been able to find it again</p>
<p t="3703300" d="4880">but, when the movie was over every single person in the theater was crying</p>
<p t="3708180" d="4140">and not just a little bit, they were just out of it, it was brilliant</p>
<p t="3712780" d="1200">terrifying movie</p>
<p t="3713980" d="2520">and that meant that was something right about it, man</p>
<p t="3717020" d="2560">and it got people, and you you might say</p>
<p t="3720160" d="3440">you know you have dim apprehensions about the world</p>
<p t="3723600" d="3640">and some of those are instinctual, and some of those are a consequence of your</p>
<p t="3727460" d="2460">of your experience, and it's like</p>
<p t="3729920" d="6240">the pieces are fragmented, but, if you get away from them, a long ways, you can see how they fit together</p>
<p t="3736160" d="3800">but they are fragmented and then you go see a story and those pieces go</p>
<p t="3739960" d="1380">click, click, click, click</p>
<p t="3741340" d="3880">and then you think, Wow! That's what, that's how that works out, that's what that means</p>
<p t="3745220" d="5020">and that produces that overwhelming emotion, and then, and that partly how you make yourself</p>
<p t="3750460" d="3060">transparent to yourself</p>
<p t="3753520" d="5920">You go and experience a story and watch a story and you tell a story and you start to find out who you are by doing that</p>
<p t="3760580" d="4540">My nephew, had a dream at one point</p>
<p t="3765120" d="5300">someone made a little animated thing out of it and put it on the Internet which is quite cool</p>
<p t="3770420" d="4980">So anyways, he was having night terrors and he ran around like a little knight</p>
<p t="3776280" d="4680">you know, k-n-i-g-h-t, knight and he had a little</p>
<p t="3780960" d="3840">you know, armor and a sword and he would run around the house</p>
<p t="3784800" d="2500">with a little knight hat on, being a knight</p>
<p t="3787300" d="3500">and he was only like four or something and he had watched a lot of Disney movies</p>
<p t="3790800" d="3220">a lot of movies, so he kind of got the knight idea, it was</p>
<p t="3794020" d="3980">He was acting that out and he was having terrors at night, right</p>
<p t="3798000" d="5260">and so he would go to bed with his little knight hat and his sword and he would put them on his bed, and then</p>
<p t="3803260" d="3500">at night he would wake up screaming, and that happened for a very long time, and so</p>
<p t="3806760" d="3820">when I went to visit, you know, I found out that this was happening and</p>
<p t="3810580" d="3480">he had night terror, so the kid wakes up with night terrors</p>
<p t="3814060" d="3560">screaming but can't remember anything generally speaking, so</p>
<p t="3817780" d="2320">anyways, this was happening and so</p>
<p t="3820100" d="4980">it happened one day and I was sitting with him and his family at the breakfast table and I,</p>
<p t="3825620" d="4080">said, ";Did you have a dream?"; and he said ";Oh yes, I had a dream";</p>
<p t="3829700" d="2060">I said, ";Well, what was your dream?";</p>
<p t="3831800" d="800">and he said,</p>
<p t="3832780" d="6680">";Well I was out in this field, I was surrounded by the dwarves and they came up to my knees and</p>
<p t="3839460" d="2980">they were, they didn't have any arms they had big feet</p>
<p t="3842440" d="6020">and they were covered with hair and there was a cross shaved at the top of their head and they were all greasy and they had huge beaks</p>
<p t="3848460" d="3120">and every where I went they jumped at me with their beaks</p>
<p t="3851580" d="1100">and there was lots of them!";</p>
<p t="3852840" d="4400">and every body was very quiet after he said this because it was like</p>
<p t="3857240" d="4080">Oh, that's why you were screaming at night, it's like yeah, OK!</p>
<p t="3861720" d="500">and so</p>
<p t="3864360" d="960">so then he said</p>
<p t="3865320" d="3180">";But at the background there was a dragon, and the dragon would</p>
<p t="3868500" d="3660">blow out smoke and fire and then it would turn into these dwarves!";</p>
<p t="3872160" d="3220">so it's like, man, that kid had a problem, right, it was like</p>
<p t="3875380" d="3980">Well, what are you going to do, fight off a dwarf, who cares! Puff!</p>
<p t="3879420" d="3580">Ten more, that's life man, that's life!</p>
<p t="3883000" d="540">Really!</p>
<p t="3883760" d="1140">That's the Hydra</p>
<p t="3884900" d="4420">you cut off one head and seven more grow, that's life, snakes everywhere</p>
<p t="3889320" d="2460">and you get rid of one and there will be more</p>
<p t="3891940" d="1840">and so, he figured that out!</p>
<p t="3893780" d="2940">It's a hell of an existential shock when you are four</p>
<p t="3896720" d="3560">and so he is like, he is a knight, he's thinking, what do I do about these dwarves</p>
<p t="3900280" d="2480">well their are too many of them, but there is a dragon</p>
<p t="3902760" d="3200">well so I said, ";Well, what could you do about that?";</p>
<p t="3906260" d="5840">Right, loaded question, it implies that you could do something about that!</p>
<p t="3912100" d="3240">Well he kind of knew that, which he was running around like a knight</p>
<p t="3915640" d="2000">and he kind of figured that out</p>
<p t="3917640" d="1900">and he said, ";Well I'll get my dad,</p>
<p t="3919540" d="5500">and I jump up on the dragon and I poke out both of his eyes with my sword and then I go right down its stomach</p>
<p t="3925040" d="6240">to the place where the fire came out, the firebox, and then I'd carve a piece of the firebox out and make a shield,</p>
<p t="3931400" d="2240">and that would be the end of that!"; And I thought,</p>
<p t="3933840" d="3140">Wow! Good work kid! Like</p>
<p t="3937600" d="3680">you really got it, right, it's the central human story.</p>
<p t="3941320" d="3600">There's the terrible unknown, right, fire breathing</p>
<p t="3945000" d="1360">generating trouble</p>
<p t="3946360" d="2960">and what do you do, you confront that, you confront that</p>
<p t="3949320" d="4060">and by confronting it you get stronger, that's the shield, and that's</p>
<p t="3953600" d="1840">that's what a human being is</p>
<p t="3955660" d="2940">and that's right, it's exactly right</p>
<p t="3958600" d="2000">and that was the end of his night terrors, by the way</p>
<p t="3960600" d="2960">which seems to good to be true, but it is actually true</p>
<p t="3963560" d="3160">because I followed up with his mother for a long time, and that was that!</p>
<p t="3966720" d="2200">He catalyzed that part of his identity</p>
<p t="3969420" d="2880">he adopted the role of the mythological hero</p>
<p t="3972300" d="4420">and that's what he needed to do, because, like there was a dragon and a bunch of dwarves</p>
<p t="3976720" d="3160">like what the hell are you going to do about that? Run? That's not going to help.</p>
<p t="3980080" d="2640">You know, if you run in a dream like that</p>
<p t="3982720" d="3980">the dwarves multiply and the get bigger and you get smaller as you run</p>
<p t="3987440" d="3440">It's like, that no a good, that is not a good solution</p>
<p t="3990880" d="5920">and people do that in their life all the time, and so the dwarves get bigger until they are giants</p>
<p t="3996800" d="3020">and they get smaller until there is nothing left of them, and then</p>
<p t="4002160" d="2800">then there is no recovery, that is not good</p>
<p t="4006600" d="6620">Now, OK, so now I also proposed to you that there is a symbolic structure to the world</p>
<p t="4013220" d="4480">It's a meta-structure I would say, I think these categories are truly real</p>
<p t="4017780" d="3420">and their basically this! There's</p>
<p t="4021460" d="3120">unexplored territory and explored territory</p>
<p t="4024580" d="1120">and there is you!</p>
<p t="4026540" d="5440">and unexplored territory is the source of great riches and probably will kill you and</p>
<p t="4031980" d="4920">explored territory is you culture and it crunches you into submission and conformity</p>
<p t="4037160" d="2720">and turns you into a civilized being, and</p>
<p t="4039880" d="5540">you are stuck with both of those and then there is you, you know you are kind of admirable and cool and you do a lot of</p>
<p t="4045420" d="4620">decent wonderful amazing things and there are things about you that are just horrible</p>
<p t="4050040" d="4380">and you know about them, and you are stuck with them and that's the world</p>
<p t="4055140" d="4080">and that's the the landscape of the world and what you will see</p>
<p t="4059640" d="5840">if you pay attention is that people who are ideologues like Rousseau or say, like Hobbes</p>
<p t="4065480" d="3400">but it doesn't matter, ideologues will tell you part of that story</p>
<p t="4068880" d="2640">so environmentalists for example will say</p>
<p t="4072160" d="3600">Nature, that's pristine beauty</p>
<p t="4076180" d="1540">natural harmony</p>
<p t="4078160" d="1900">French landscape</p>
<p t="4080060" d="4320">it's a paradise especially if there are no people, it's a paradise</p>
<p t="4084580" d="3440">and then, culture is a rapacious monster</p>
<p t="4088240" d="3840">and human beings driving that culture against nature are</p>
<p t="4092360" d="6880">monsters of a sort that, and perhaps there should be fewer of then, it's like, yeah, yeah that's all true</p>
<p t="4099240" d="3140">it's exactly dead on, right on, exactly right</p>
<p t="4104120" d="2000">Was that movie called Avatar?</p>
<p t="4107160" d="2720">Yes, that's James Cameron's movie right?</p>
<p t="4110060" d="2200">That's that story, yeah, and</p>
<p t="4112960" d="2440">Hey, it's a good story</p>
<p t="4115400" d="3040">It's even a mythological story but it is only half the story</p>
<p t="4118440" d="4040">The other story you could think about it as a frontier myth, that's Star Trek</p>
<p t="4122500" d="3760">or Star Wars for that matter, mostly Star Trek, it's like</p>
<p t="4128260" d="7200">but we will put it into the context of the frontier myth, the myth that drew settlers into America, say. It's, well</p>
<p t="4136900" d="7000">there is a wild savage landscape out there that can be conquered by and settled and stabilized by civilization</p>
<p t="4144080" d="2880">and it will be the heroic pioneer who does it</p>
<p t="4146960" d="6700">It's exactly the opposite story of the environmental story, which is why I think that the environmental story emerged. It was</p>
<p t="4154060" d="2280">you know the frontier story</p>
<p t="4156500" d="2800">had a lack in it, it missed half of the world</p>
<p t="4159300" d="2440">and so the other story had to come up and it did</p>
<p t="4161740" d="4720">and if you take both of those  stories, even though they are exactly the opposite to one another</p>
<p t="4166460" d="3900">if you know both those stories, then you know the whole story</p>
<p t="4170600" d="5360">and it's really weird, you know, because one of the propositions of formal logic</p>
<p t="4175960" d="6740">is, it's a fundamental proposition is that something can't be itself and it's opposite at the same time, it's like</p>
<p t="4182900" d="5000">that's true for some sorts of things, it's true for logical claims</p>
<p t="4188160" d="7840">but it is completely wrong in this particular situation because things are, what they are and their opposites at the same time</p>
<p t="4196320" d="2640">and that makes it very very difficult to</p>
<p t="4198960" d="2320">that's why a dragon hoards gold, it's like</p>
<p t="4201820" d="1360">What's up with that?</p>
<p t="4203200" d="1360">Well it will eat you!</p>
<p t="4205100" d="3300">And it will, but it has gold!</p>
<p t="4208540" d="4940">So what do you do about that? Because it's paradoxical demands</p>
<p t="4213480" d="4640">well, what you want to do is face the dragon and get the damn gold, that's what you want to do</p>
<p t="4218420" d="500">well</p>
<p t="4220660" d="4560">you have to be a paradoxical being even to do that, so, in ";The Hobbit";</p>
<p t="4225740" d="2320">for example, when, what's his name</p>
<p t="4228620" d="3840">Frodo, right? It's not, it's Bilbo in ";The Hobbit";</p>
<p t="4232460" d="3200">You know he is kind of this little underdeveloped</p>
<p t="4236780" d="3600">over protected Shire dweller, and,</p>
<p t="4240780" d="2160">he is called on a great adventure</p>
<p t="4243040" d="5120">to go and find the dragon, and he has to become a thief</p>
<p t="4248160" d="1120">in order to manage it</p>
<p t="4249620" d="4000">Well that's pretty weird, you know, it's like, it's because</p>
<p t="4254260" d="4040">as a good citizen he is just not enough to conquer a dragon</p>
<p t="4258300" d="6600">He also has to become a bad citizen in some sense, he has to incorporate the part of himself that is monstrous</p>
<p t="4264900" d="2540">let's say, and develop that and hone it</p>
<p t="4267720" d="4160">and that's to say that, if you are harmless you are not virtuous</p>
<p t="4272800" d="1440">you are just harmless</p>
<p t="4274320" d="1360">you are like a rabbit</p>
<p t="4276380" d="5360">a rabbit isn't virtuous, it's just can't do anything except get eaten</p>
<p t="4281740" d="1120">it's not virtuous</p>
<p t="4283640" d="3880">If you are a monster, and you don't act monstrously</p>
<p t="4287520" d="3320">then you are virtuous, but you also have to be a monster</p>
<p t="4290840" d="4240">Well you see this all the time, Harry Potter is like that too, it's like he is flawed</p>
<p t="4295080" d="2820">he's hurt, he has go evil in him, he can talk to snakes, man</p>
<p t="4297940" d="1840">He breaks rules all the time</p>
<p t="4299780" d="5600">All the time, he is not obedient at all, but, you know, he has a good reason for breaking the rules</p>
<p t="4305760" d="2240">and if he couldn't break the rules</p>
<p t="4308000" d="5640">him and his little clique of rule breaking troublemakers, if they didn't break the rules</p>
<p t="4313640" d="2380">they wouldn't attain the highest goal</p>
<p t="4316420" d="6240">so it is very peculiar, but it's very, it's a very very very very common mythological notion</p>
<p t="4323120" d="1760">You know, the hero has to be</p>
<p t="4327260" d="1760">the hero has to be a monster</p>
<p t="4329020" d="6340">but a controlled monster, Batman is like that, you know, I mean it's everywhere, it's the story you always hear</p>
<p t="4335360" d="2800">[Student] Is this where morals become ethics?</p>
<p t="4338540" d="2080">[JBP] Meaning? You have to be more precise.</p>
<p t="4340740" d="6680">[Student] I feel like, because every one is moral, but,  in order to become ethics you have to refine the morals, you have to kind of go into....</p>
<p t="4347740" d="4560">[JBP] Well that's a good question, you know, because one question is</p>
<p t="4352300" d="3920">you know you are kind of implicitly moral in so far as you are socialized</p>
<p t="4356220" d="2500">but that is sort of procedural, it's just built into you</p>
<p t="4358720" d="3060">this is different, this is also becoming conscious of it</p>
<p t="4361780" d="4080">and expanding out your personality into dimensions that it wouldn't normally occupy, so</p>
<p t="4366020" d="2640">this happens to people all the time</p>
<p t="4368660" d="4780">So, for example, lots of my clients, my clinical clients are too agreeable</p>
<p t="4373440" d="4320">and, they are generally women because women are more agreeable than men</p>
<p t="4377760" d="2820">but not always, because I have had agreeable men as clients as well</p>
<p t="4380580" d="5720">and what happens is, they're resentful and they don't how to stand up for themselves and it's because they're</p>
<p t="4386300" d="6100">very compassionate by nature, and so, if you entering into a negotiation with them, they will let you win</p>
<p t="4392400" d="3320">Well that's not so good, because you need to win to,</p>
<p t="4395720" d="2900">Especially if you are in an organisation of adults</p>
<p t="4398880" d="3000">where there is a struggle, right,</p>
<p t="4401880" d="1920">When you have kids you can let them win</p>
<p t="4403800" d="3740">especially infants, like you have to let them win and that's partly</p>
<p t="4408580" d="2840">why compassion is so necessary, but as a</p>
<p t="4412140" d="3280">basis for negotiation between adults, it's like</p>
<p t="4415700" d="6100">Sorry, it's insufficient, you have to be a bit of a monster so that you can say no.</p>
<p t="4421800" d="2480">And so a lot of what you do in psychotherapy</p>
<p t="4424280" d="3480">is treat peoples anxiety and depression, that's a huge chunk of it</p>
<p t="4427760" d="4940">help them straighten out the way they think, that's a huge chunk of it, but another chuck of it is</p>
<p t="4432700" d="5000">well let's toughen you up, you know, let's put you in a position where you can bargain, let's teach you how to</p>
<p t="4437700" d="5420">assert yourself and stand up for yourself, and that's assertiveness training and it's a huge chunk of psychotherapy</p>
<p t="4443600" d="3320">and you need to learn it, because</p>
<p t="4447380" d="5120">part of how you regulate your interactions with other people is to negotiate</p>
<p t="4452900" d="3040">and you cannot negotiate unless you can say no</p>
<p t="4456380" d="960">you can't do it</p>
<p t="4457340" d="3180">and it cause conflict to say no, and if you don't like conflict</p>
<p t="4460520" d="2680">which is basically the definition of being agreeable</p>
<p t="4463200" d="4020">then you cannot tolerate the conflict and so then you can't negotiate on your own behalf</p>
<p t="4467220" d="1260">and so then you keep losing!</p>
<p t="4468480" d="1580">And you are bullied, and you know</p>
<p t="4470580" d="2720">it's not good, then you get resentful and</p>
<p t="4473300" d="2180">and it's really not good, so you have to</p>
<p t="4475480" d="2460">develop your inner monster a little bit</p>
<p t="4478780" d="4160">and, and then that makes you a better person, not a worse person</p>
<p t="4483040" d="800">It's weird!</p>
<p t="4484320" d="1440">It's weird, but,</p>
<p t="4486540" d="1680">but that's just how it is.</p>
<p t="4494320" d="1040">Outside of that</p>
<p t="4495620" d="5040">diagram is chaos itself and that's the chaos from which things emerge, now,</p>
<p t="4500660" d="3680">I can't tell you much about that yet because it's do damn complicated</p>
<p t="4504340" d="3680">but I think the best way to think about chaos is as potential</p>
<p t="4508020" d="4980">That's one way of thinking about it.  It's also that place you end up when you don't know what to do.</p>
<p t="4516080" d="7820">It's the source of all things, but it is also the terrible predator, the terrible eternal predator that lurks beyond the explored domain.</p>
<p t="4524140" d="1900">It's a winged dragon</p>
<p t="4526040" d="4880">and it's winged, who knows why, matter and spirit, that's partly what it is</p>
<p t="4530920" d="1220">and I will explain that later</p>
<p t="4532200" d="5580">It's also potentially the predatory beast that's been after us for, forever</p>
<p t="4538020" d="4180">And the winged predator that picked us off from the sky, so</p>
<p t="4542200" d="2240">primates for example, monkeys have</p>
<p t="4544440" d="5860">some monkeys have three specialized alarm crys, one is for snakes, and that usually means</p>
<p t="4550300" d="5440">Hit the trees! And then one is for leopards, and that means, hit the trees and go out on a skinny branch</p>
<p t="4555740" d="1680">because the leopard can't get to you</p>
<p t="4557420" d="6840">and then there is one for like birds of pray which means hide somewhere on the ground so that you don't get picked off, and it's like, well</p>
<p t="4565280" d="2640">That's what that is, that's what that is</p>
<p t="4568720" d="1120">and that's chaos</p>
<p t="4570440" d="2800">and it's expanded into much more than that</p>
<p t="4573240" d="5960">and then I showed you, I don't remember if I showed you this, but, this is a symbolic representation of</p>
<p t="4579200" d="6640">Mother Nature, Father Culture and the suffering of the individual, but it is all, that's all positive</p>
<p t="4586140" d="2400">There's no negative elements there</p>
<p t="4588640" d="960">but, that's OK</p>
<p t="4589600" d="4300">that's a partial representation and those things are sacred in some sense because</p>
<p t="4593900" d="2380">they are representative of an ultimate</p>
<p t="4596480" d="7560">reality, of an ultimate reality, the sacrificial individual here, the suffering individual, well that's pretty straight forward, it's like</p>
<p t="4605560" d="1680">that's what, that's life</p>
<p t="4607880" d="2080">that's suffering, that's life</p>
<p t="4609960" d="4240">that's what happens to the individual, so, and everyone is looking at that.</p>
<p t="4615880" d="1440">It has power that idea</p>
<p t="4618120" d="1840">Well it's because, you know</p>
<p t="4619960" d="6820">culture supports the suffering individual, and culture is nested inside benevolent nature and that's</p>
<p t="4626780" d="1900">part of the story of the world,</p>
<p t="4628680" d="4100">and it's the part of the story we are trying to figure out and make articulate, we have been doing that</p>
<p t="4632780" d="3620">for thousands of years, trying to make this story articulate</p>
<p t="4637300" d="5280">and it's not yet articulated, it's only, we are only getting it, we are getting it</p>
<p t="4642580" d="4880">and we basically do that now with movies and stories and fiction and that sort of thing</p>
<p t="4647720" d="2320">We still don't have it articulated</p>
<p t="4650040" d="2700">I think Jung went close, came closer than anyone else</p>
<p t="4652740" d="2400">Jung and Erich Neumann who was one of his students</p>
<p t="4655140" d="5440">came closer than anyone else ever has to actually articulating that, and that's what Jung was trying to do</p>
<p t="4660580" d="2600">Is to take all these images, archetypal images</p>
<p t="4663180" d="4720">Instinctual images and say, well, what do they mean? What do they mean? What do they mean?</p>
<p t="4667900" d="4900">And he got a long ways on that, although his writing is quite obscure, and it's obscure because</p>
<p t="4672800" d="4800">How the hell are you going to explain an image like that, without being obscure? It's like</p>
<p t="4677760" d="3920">it's insanely complicated, and it's not linear</p>
<p t="4681680" d="3120">It's not a linear thing, that's why it's in a picture</p>
<p t="4684800" d="2700">Because a picture presents everything at once</p>
<p t="4687500" d="4680">and you want to take that apart linearly. Jesus! It's just, it's just impossible.</p>
<p t="4692180" d="3780">But we have been struggling to do that, really we have been struggling</p>
<p t="4695960" d="2260">From the time that we became self-conscious</p>
<p t="4698540" d="3840">You know, what is the world about? How should we live in it?</p>
<p t="4702380" d="4640">Well that's a partial answer, and it's a culture bound answer, obviously</p>
<p t="4707100" d="5520">But you see archetypal representations like this in many cultures, so for example</p>
<p t="4712620" d="4320">the image of the Virgin and Child, that way predates Christianity</p>
<p t="4717060" d="5760">like the Egyptians, that was Isis and Horus, that goes back, hoh, we have no idea how far</p>
<p t="4722820" d="4740">thousands and thousands of years before the emergence of Judaism and Christianity</p>
<p t="4727740" d="2680">Way back before that, and no doubt</p>
<p t="4730820" d="2560">back into prehistory itself! Because</p>
<p t="4733420" d="3200">a culture that doesn't hold</p>
<p t="4736940" d="2980">the mother and child as sacred, dies!</p>
<p t="4740200" d="1520">Obviously!</p>
<p t="4741940" d="2100">Because, obviously!</p>
<p t="4744900" d="5680">So, it has to be held, it has to be held as something</p>
<p t="4750580" d="6000">that you revere, which at least means that, you don't kill mothers and children, it at least means that!</p>
<p t="4757240" d="6160">And that's an instinct, you know,, it's an instinct, it violates you to to that and thank God!</p>
<p t="4764700" d="640">Alright,</p>
<p t="4766240" d="1440">Let's take 15 minutes</p>
<p t="4769900" d="500">So,</p>
<p t="4771540" d="5920">I told you about this a little bit last week, but, you know, one of the motivations I had for</p>
<p t="4777460" d="2820">thinking about the things that I have thought through</p>
<p t="4780280" d="3560">the motivation I had for thinking them through was because</p>
<p t="4785240" d="600">Well, I</p>
<p t="4788040" d="3060">It seemed self-evident to me, let's say</p>
<p t="4791300" d="6080">and I think that it was partly from reading Jung, but that just helped me clarify it, was that</p>
<p t="4797380" d="2560">You know it was sort of Jung's contention that</p>
<p t="4801540" d="5040">We had an organic development of a metaphysical ethic</p>
<p t="4807240" d="3040">that was embedded in, in religious tradition</p>
<p t="4810280" d="6380">and that basically unfolded let's say in the West until about 1600, 1500, something like that, and then</p>
<p t="4816820" d="4840">science emerged and we got unbelievably technologically powerful</p>
<p t="4821980" d="2160">using a certain view of the world</p>
<p t="4824140" d="2420">you know, we are so technologically powerful</p>
<p t="4826620" d="2440">but, we are still not very wise</p>
<p t="4829560" d="3040">and that just seem to me to be a bad combination</p>
<p t="4832600" d="4500">and, I thought about that a lot, it's like, OK, how do you handle the combination of</p>
<p t="4837100" d="2200">exceptional technological power and</p>
<p t="4839700" d="2160">and an impaired ethic, let's say</p>
<p t="4841860" d="4260">something like that, underdeveloped ethic or one in even which you have no faith, because</p>
<p t="4846360" d="6000">you know, it seems, the foundational elements of it are irrational, they're in mythology</p>
<p t="4852360" d="3660">they're in religion, they don't fit well with the scientific world view</p>
<p t="4856540" d="2880">How do you rectify that problem? And</p>
<p t="4859420" d="2760">Well that's a tough problem, you know, it's a crazy problem</p>
<p t="4862180" d="4440">and certainly it was the problem that Jung was trying to address, there is no doubt about it</p>
<p t="4866620" d="5380">Along with that went an associated problem which was, you know, what happened in the 20th century</p>
<p t="4872240" d="1420">which was so awful</p>
<p t="4874120" d="6840">and in so many places, it was just so unbelievably brutal and terrible and it was perpetrated by</p>
<p t="4880960" d="5500">millions of people, and they were individual people and they weren't that much different from normal people</p>
<p t="4886460" d="2340">and in fact they were normal people. So,</p>
<p t="4888800" d="4420">the other thing that struck me was that it would be better if that sort of thing didn't happen anymore</p>
<p t="4893220" d="4140">and so I was trying to figure what the hell could possibly be done about that, and</p>
<p t="4897360" d="5740">you know, part of Jung's contention was, well you had to understand yourself as a monster if you were ever going to</p>
<p t="4903100" d="6560">maintain some control over the fact that you are in fact a monster and that that could come forth if the situation is correct</p>
<p t="4910080" d="3280">Ok, that seems reasonable, and so,</p>
<p t="4915700" d="4080">Well it seemed to me that , you know, people had to become wiser</p>
<p t="4919780" d="4540">and, of course, that's a very difficult things to figure out, because you could even question</p>
<p t="4924320" d="3260">whether there is such a thing as wisdom, you know, and</p>
<p t="4927580" d="5920">and then I thought well that's what the universities are supposed to do, especially the humanities mostly, in particular</p>
<p t="4933500" d="2980">it is supposed to make you wise, that's what it's for</p>
<p t="4936480" d="3340">and it's a doing a terrible job of that in my estimation</p>
<p t="4939820" d="5580">it's more decimating people as far as I can tell, and undermining whatever ethic that they have</p>
<p t="4945640" d="2400">rather than making people wise</p>
<p t="4949260" d="660">and,</p>
<p t="4949920" d="5920">but I think that we have to become wise, I don't think that there is a choice, I think it's a matter of survival, and</p>
<p t="4955840" d="4180">it's more than that, because if you're wise in your own life, you are going to have a way better life</p>
<p t="4960580" d="3360">like incomparably better because you are going to</p>
<p t="4963940" d="5620">sleep soundly with a good conscience at night, and you know people say that's worth more than money</p>
<p t="4969560" d="4980">that's worth more than money. I know lots of people who have lots of money and let me tell you</p>
<p t="4974540" d="6340">money protects you, you are as well as protected from the world by money right now as you ever will be for the rest of your life</p>
<p t="4980880" d="4300">because most of life's fundamental problems can't be solved with money!</p>
<p t="4985180" d="4920">you know, like, rich people get divorced, they have affairs, their children get sick</p>
<p t="4990100" d="3980">they have all the problem you have, and that's partly because you are already rich</p>
<p t="4994480" d="780">And so,</p>
<p t="4995840" d="4720">you might think that if you had a bunch more money  things would be better</p>
<p t="5000560" d="3180">but it's just not true, in fact in some ways they might be worse</p>
<p t="5004100" d="1680">because money can open up</p>
<p t="5005780" d="5600">can open up the possibility of all sorts of temptations to you that you just can't afford at the moment</p>
<p t="5013080" d="5040">So, well so, economics, we have already solved that problem fundamentally</p>
<p t="5018120" d="2680">and we are rapidly solving it everywhere in the world, right.</p>
<p t="5020800" d="6660">The world economy is growing so damn fast that you can't even imagine how you could possibly make it grow any faster</p>
<p t="5027460" d="5920">It's crazy, we have lifted hundreds of millions of people out of poverty in the last 15 years, you know</p>
<p t="5033660" d="4680">The U.N. set a goal, by 2015, I think it was to cut poverty by half</p>
<p t="5038500" d="4760">if I remember correctly, and they reached it two years early, you know, it's like</p>
<p t="5043480" d="2100">It's unbelievable! So,</p>
<p t="5049360" d="1680">Well, so then I started to</p>
<p t="5051880" d="2400">try to understand what it might be to</p>
<p t="5054280" d="5140">to live and really what I was looking for, and was not so much to live a life that was wise</p>
<p t="5059420" d="3900">but at least to live a life that wasn't pathologically unwise</p>
<p t="5063420" d="2300">you know, I thought of</p>
<p t="5065720" d="2740">the sorts of things that people were doing to one another in the</p>
<p t="5068520" d="4080">Auschwitz camps, and in the Gulag Archipelago and all of that</p>
<p t="5072760" d="2080">horror that was perpetrated on</p>
<p t="5075080" d="4560">on people as definitely unwise, whatever else you might say about it,</p>
<p t="5079640" d="4480">it was unwise, so then I though maybe there is a way to figure out how you could not do that!</p>
<p t="5085440" d="960">And so, that's</p>
<p t="5086980" d="1600">and I think that that's,</p>
<p t="5088800" d="5840">my sense is that when you come to university to learn how to be a civilized person</p>
<p t="5094640" d="2380">which is what is supposed to happen at university</p>
<p t="5097020" d="5000">otherwise it is just a trade school, and you might as well go to trade school as far as I am concerned if you want</p>
<p t="5102280" d="4240">to learn, something that will get you a job, it's like, it's a lot</p>
<p t="5106640" d="4960">faster, and it's more certain and it's useful</p>
<p t="5111740" d="3680">if you are not taught to be a citizen at university, then</p>
<p t="5117080" d="1280">Why bother with it?</p>
<p t="5118360" d="3300">So, well so that's what we are trying to figure out!</p>
<p t="5121800" d="2780">and, and that's part of that</p>
<p t="5124580" d="4200">cloud of mythological fantasy that surrounds our culture, that's</p>
<p t="5128780" d="3120">it's part of its deep history that we are trying to,</p>
<p t="5131900" d="3260">you know, if you grapple with the humanities and with art and all of that</p>
<p t="5135400" d="4400">that you are trying, you are trying to master and incorporate and,</p>
<p t="5139920" d="5080">pull in to you so that you're situated properly in history, and</p>
<p t="5145180" d="4880">and you are not just floating in the void of, you know, this</p>
<p t="5150060" d="5880">tiny individuality that is divorced from everything else, you are weak in that circumstance</p>
<p t="5156720" d="1420">Alright, so</p>
<p t="5161460" d="7000">that's more of an explanation of why I try to puzzle through these things, and try to puzzle through them with you</p>
<p t="5168680" d="5300">So anyways, we talked about this song last week, and</p>
<p t="5174180" d="5840">you know, I made a hypothesis to you, we'll go through this quickly</p>
<p t="5180020" d="3780">It's doggerel, it's not great poetry but it is irrelevant</p>
<p t="5184340" d="3120">It was a very popular son, it's quite beautiful</p>
<p t="5187460" d="4440">In the movie it actually sung by like a heavenly choir, that's what it sounds like, so</p>
<p t="5191900" d="5000">Its got this cathedral, you can imagine people singing it in a cathedral essentially,</p>
<p t="5196900" d="2480">and so that's not accidental, it's purposeful</p>
<p t="5199560" d="3200">you know, it partakes of that</p>
<p t="5203600" d="5060">what would you call it, it partakes of that esthetic, that's. that's it</p>
<p t="5208920" d="2800">So the film makers are, are</p>
<p t="5212060" d="1320">implying that</p>
<p t="5213540" d="3340">what is about to be shown to you has this</p>
<p t="5218120" d="6700">divine element, essentially and that that's signified by the choir of voices that sings this song</p>
<p t="5227780" d="3600">and the song says, fundamentally something like this</p>
<p t="5231560" d="5760">is that if you lift up our eyes above the temporal, into the transcendent, and so that's</p>
<p t="5237640" d="4780">what exists in the heavenly world, in the stars</p>
<p t="5242860" d="4160">if you pick an ultimate goal, if you pick the right ultimate goal</p>
<p t="5247340" d="500">then,</p>
<p t="5247840" d="3380">and anyone can do this, that's the other thing it's democratic</p>
<p t="5251220" d="4660">it's anyone can do this, so that's the second proposition, ";It doesn't matter who you are";</p>
<p t="5256060" d="1040">You can do this.</p>
<p t="5257100" d="4800">And so, I think that's a reflection of the idea of the divinity of the individual, it's like</p>
<p t="5261900" d="4900">there is something about each individual that's valuable, regardless of their idiosyncrasies , and</p>
<p t="5266800" d="3980">and so they have this potential that they can manifest, and how you manifest it? Well,</p>
<p t="5270780" d="3880">you pick the right goal, and, what's the right goal, well it's high</p>
<p t="5275080" d="2560">it's elevated, it's above the mundane</p>
<p t="5277640" d="5460">Now what does that mean? Well you don't really know, you don't really know? That's why it is signified by a star, and</p>
<p t="5283100" d="2580">the star is something that glimmers in the night, right</p>
<p t="5285680" d="2280">so it's a source of light in the darkness</p>
<p t="5287960" d="3660">And so, there is a metaphor in there, obviously, there is a metaphor there.</p>
<p t="5291900" d="4100">And, the star is the star that that's the star of Hollywood</p>
<p t="5296120" d="3740">you know, the person that you emulate, that's part of it because an ideal</p>
<p t="5299860" d="3240">is, it's going to be a human ideal of some sort that you are going to be aiming at</p>
<p t="5303100" d="5460">and so the ideal human being is the star that you are aiming at, maybe it's something like that.</p>
<p t="5308560" d="6000">If that's what you are aiming at, well you might say, well, ";What should you aim at in life?"; And one answer is, well,</p>
<p t="5315100" d="2320">Why don't you aim at being</p>
<p t="5317420" d="2620">whatever you could be that would be the best!</p>
<p t="5320200" d="4320">Now, you don't know what that is, exactly, because how do you know</p>
<p t="5324520" d="5240">you know, what, you could think ";Well that would be really good if I could have it"; And then you could say, ";Well,</p>
<p t="5329760" d="5420">can I think of anything better than that?"; and if the answer is no, then well, why not go for that?</p>
<p t="5335180" d="5000">You know, well you might say, ";Well, it's too ambitious, it takes too much responsibility.";</p>
<p t="5340180" d="3140">It's like, yeah yeah, those are definitely problems and,</p>
<p t="5343320" d="4460">one of the things that I have figured out over the years is that if you offered the person the opportunity, you know</p>
<p t="5347780" d="4260">because people say, ";Well, life doesn't really have any ultimate meaning";. It's like</p>
<p t="5352040" d="3640">yeah, OK, fine, let's say that it has an ultimate meaning</p>
<p t="5356500" d="1800">but that in order to</p>
<p t="5358920" d="6320">experience that ultimate meaning you have to take on ultimate responsibility for what you do.</p>
<p t="5365240" d="3360">That's a heavy price to pay to have a meaningful life.</p>
<p t="5368600" d="5640">You know, and you might say ";Well, there's no damn way I going to do that, I'll just go for the, you know, pointless,</p>
<p t="5377200" d="8480">I'll go for the trivial pointless perspective, which is kind of hard on me existentially, but it frees me up, I can do whatever the hell I want,</p>
<p t="5385680" d="2880">moment to moment, I don't have any ultimate 
responsibility.";</p>
<p t="5388560" d="5480">and so then, you think ";That's kind of a good deal";. And then, but that raises this weird spectre</p>
<p t="5394040" d="4440">of doubt, which is, well, when you hear people talk about the ultimate futility of life</p>
<p t="5398480" d="4840">is it because life is ultimately futile, or is it because they have decided that</p>
<p t="5403560" d="7820">they would just as soon not adopt the responsibility, and they use that real decision, which is to not adopt the responsibility</p>
<p t="5411380" d="5720">they rationalize that by proposing that life is ultimately meaningful (sic), meaningless</p>
<p t="5417100" d="3880">and like, you know I kind of buy that, I really do think that's what is going on.</p>
<p t="5421320" d="500">So,</p>
<p t="5423520" d="1260">but maybe not</p>
<p t="5425040" d="7000">but it could be that if you want to have an ultimately meaningful life that you have to adopt ultimate responsibility</p>
<p t="5432380" d="2560">Makes sense, and what might that mean?</p>
<p t="5437060" d="2320">Well one thing it might mean is that</p>
<p t="5439700" d="2080">And I do think it means this, is that</p>
<p t="5441780" d="6380">I think that it was Alexander Pope, but I might be wrong about that who said, ";Nothing human is foreign to me";</p>
<p t="5448160" d="800">[transcibers note] Publius Terentius Afer, Terence, ";I am a man: nothing human is foreign to me.";</p>
<p t="5448960" d="5100">and that's a hell of a statement, right, because if you  think about all the things that human beings are capable of</p>
<p t="5454840" d="1840">and they are capable of some</p>
<p t="5456680" d="5800">like if you really want to know what people are capable of, you should read about Unit 731</p>
<p t="5462480" d="5100">but I would not recommend it, because if you read it, you will never forget it, and you will be sorry that you read it</p>
<p t="5468080" d="1780">but, you'll know</p>
<p t="5470780" d="5520">Anyways, to say that human is foreign to you, that's a hell of a thing to say, because</p>
<p t="5476300" d="3320">that means that what other people have done, you could do</p>
<p t="5479620" d="3660">and that also means you need to take responsibility for that</p>
<p t="5484380" d="4880">that's no joke, you know, it's a big deal to do that in even a trivial manner</p>
<p t="5490060" d="6620">Anyways, so the idea is you can elevate, if you elevate you viewpoint to some transcendent</p>
<p t="5496680" d="5540">ethic, that you want what is ultimately good, you really want that, whatever that is!</p>
<p t="5502220" d="2680">You don't know, that's what you are aiming at</p>
<p t="5504900" d="5220">Well then it says this strange thing, well what you want will all of a sudden come to you</p>
<p t="5510120" d="4400">well that's a proposition, and it's the proposition that basically played out in the movie.</p>
<p t="5514520" d="3600">It's a hypothesis, the hypothesis is, the best way to orient yourself</p>
<p t="5518120" d="4380">in life is to orient yourself towards the highest good that you are capable of imagining</p>
<p t="5522500" d="4960">and then aim at that, and then things will work the best way they can for you.</p>
<p t="5527460" d="4180">And I think, I believe that that is correct, it's my observation of life</p>
<p t="5531940" d="3040">has lead me to see that that seems to be correct</p>
<p t="5535000" d="1040">So for example,</p>
<p t="5536040" d="2420">you don't get something that you don't aim at,</p>
<p t="5538460" d="3600">that just doesn't work out, and so lots of people aim at nothing and that's what they get.</p>
<p t="5542060" d="4400">So, if you aim at something you have a reasonable crack at getting it, you know</p>
<p t="5546460" d="3820">you tend to change what you are aiming at along the way because like what do you know, you know</p>
<p t="5550280" d="4060">You aim there, you are wrong but you get a little closer, and then you aim there and you are still wrong,</p>
<p t="5554340" d="2720">you get a little closer and you aim there, and, you know</p>
<p t="5557100" d="7000">As you move towards what you are aiming at,  you are characterization of what to aim at becomes more and more sophisticated</p>
<p t="5564100" d="4380">And so it doesn't really matter if you are wrong to begin with, as long as you are smart enough to learn on the way</p>
<p t="5568860" d="3600">and as long as you specify a goal, so specify a vague one</p>
<p t="5572460" d="5580">";I want things to be the best they could be, and I am willing to learn what best means as I go along";</p>
<p t="5578040" d="1940">Ok, ok, so fine, and then you get</p>
<p t="5580520" d="2960">what you truly need we'll say, well maybe not</p>
<p t="5583480" d="2920">[reading] ";Know that if your heart is in your dream";</p>
<p t="5586400" d="1340">What does that mean?</p>
<p t="5587740" d="4520">Well, that to me reflects this idea of a kind of integrated viewpoint.</p>
<p t="5592400" d="3120">One of the things Jung proposed, was that as you</p>
<p t="5595520" d="3700">integrate yourself psychologically what happens is that</p>
<p t="5599540" d="3200">Your rationality integrates with you emotions</p>
<p t="5602740" d="4680">they stop being opposed forces, like the Enlightenment ideas that rationality and</p>
<p t="5607540" d="3120">and desire are opposites and enemies in a sense</p>
<p t="5610660" d="3700">The Jungian notion, and the psychoanalytic notion I would say, in general</p>
<p t="5614360" d="3640">and the humanist notion even, perhaps, is that no, that's not right</p>
<p t="5618000" d="5480">what you want to do is you want to integrate your rationality with your emotions and your motivations</p>
<p t="5623860" d="2880">They're not separable, even technically,</p>
<p t="5626740" d="3160">they have to work together, and that all has to be integrated with you body</p>
<p t="5630460" d="3040">not only do you have to take your</p>
<p t="5633740" d="5320">heart into account and notice what is is that you want and don't want</p>
<p t="5639060" d="3480">but you also have to embody that, you have to act that out in the world</p>
<p t="5642540" d="3460">So, fine, that's what that means, and if you do that then</p>
<p t="5646720" d="2720">Well then your horizons will open up, and</p>
<p t="5649440" d="5640">I also believe that's true, you know, I have known people in my life who are insanely successful, like</p>
<p t="5655200" d="1800">insanely successful</p>
<p t="5657140" d="2580">and those people are, like they're</p>
<p t="5660480" d="4940">They're pretty damn together, man, you know, like they are tough, smart</p>
<p t="5665440" d="5680">strategic, generous, you know they are always giving people opportunities, honest</p>
<p t="5671120" d="1520">like, they have got it all</p>
<p t="5672640" d="4180">and you know, and sometimes, now I am not saying that everyone who is wildly successful</p>
<p t="5676820" d="4160">Is wildly successful because they have got themselves together, but</p>
<p t="5681180" d="6320">you know, because there are people who are crooks and, you know there are people who gain status</p>
<p t="5688220" d="2480">one way or another by nefarious means</p>
<p t="5691580" d="3360">but that's a lot more unstable than you might think</p>
<p t="5694940" d="3420">and I can't say exactly if that, if you pursue that route</p>
<p t="5698360" d="3940">you are going to pay for it, you will have your money or whatever it is but</p>
<p t="5703280" d="3120">it's not going to do much good for you, so,</p>
<p t="5706400" d="4420">And so it does seem to me that people that have integrated themselves, and that</p>
<p t="5711320" d="4160">and that are pursuing a noble goal, a high goal, who</p>
<p t="5715480" d="5560">actually are able to do remarkable things, and remarkable things can be done at every level</p>
<p t="5721040" d="2580">you know, it isn't like you have to change the world</p>
<p t="5723620" d="4240">as a whole, it could be that you do something remarkable within your family</p>
<p t="5727860" d="5440">you know, that can be tremendously admirable, you know, someones got to take care of a family member if they are sick</p>
<p t="5733300" d="4660">you know, there are heroic acts that you can undertake in the local environment</p>
<p t="5738140" d="4580">and maybe that will go unheralded let's say, but</p>
<p t="5742720" d="2280">that doesn't mean that it isn't remarkable, I mean</p>
<p t="5745000" d="2200">I have met people who are so damaged</p>
<p t="5747520" d="2620">you just can't imagine it, and yet</p>
<p t="5751020" d="3360">Well one person I met when I was in Montreal</p>
<p t="5754380" d="2160">was this women, and she was just ruined, man,</p>
<p t="5756540" d="4360">she looked like a street person, and she was so shy, she couldn't even look at you, like</p>
<p t="5760900" d="3980">she basically looked at the ground because it was like there was light emanating from everyone else</p>
<p t="5765120" d="3520">and she was way too timid and humble to even to bear it.</p>
<p t="5768640" d="5740">And you know, partly what I was doing was trying to get her to straighten up and not look so street personish</p>
<p t="5774380" d="3560">because it wasn't going very well for her in social interactions, you know</p>
<p t="5777940" d="4380">but it turned out that isn't what she came to the behavioural therapy unit for</p>
<p t="5782320" d="5680">and she had her aunt, I think she lived with her aunt who was like, schizophrenic and then</p>
<p t="5788120" d="7000">her aunt's boyfriend was an alcoholic who like went on long harangues about the devil, and it's like, really, man,</p>
<p t="5795120" d="2560">and she wasn't bright this women, she really wasn't and</p>
<p t="5797980" d="5840">You know she really didn't have a job and it was just like, it was just not good in every way</p>
<p t="5803980" d="4800">and then she also had this unbelievable humility and</p>
<p t="5808780" d="4580">But then it turned out what she wanted, I just couldn't bloody well believe this that</p>
<p t="5813360" d="4640">she had this dog and she used to walk it around, she took care of the dog, and, you know, that was a good thing, and</p>
<p t="5818000" d="4380">and she had actually been an inpatient at the Douglas hospital, which is where I was working, and</p>
<p t="5822380" d="3400">they're were inpatients in the Douglas hospital, and this was back in the 80's, and</p>
<p t="5825780" d="5460">those people were, like she was like Superwomen compared to the inpatients at the Douglas hospital</p>
<p t="5831240" d="4080">those people looked like they were from a Hieronymus Bosch painting</p>
<p t="5835320" d="5700">because they had deinstitutionalized everyone that could possibly be deinstitutionalized</p>
<p t="5841020" d="4280">and so the only people that were left were people who couldn't be deinstitutionalized</p>
<p t="5845300" d="3400">and so those were the people who were in the psyche wards for like 30 years, and</p>
<p t="5848700" d="4460">all of the hospitals were connected by tunnels underground and the patients used to hang out</p>
<p t="5853160" d="4420">down there by the Coke machine and so forth and one day I took my brother down there, he was visiting, and</p>
<p t="5857580" d="4160">like it was just like, he just turned white, you know, because it was just...</p>
<p t="5861740" d="5420">really, I don't know if you know Hieronymus Bosch, he is a very interesting painter to say the least, but</p>
<p t="5867160" d="1640">that's what it was like, and so</p>
<p t="5868800" d="4080">So here was here idea! She had come to the behavioural therapy unit because she had been</p>
<p t="5872880" d="4700">she had been in the inpatient ward for a while, and she met some of these ruined people</p>
<p t="5877580" d="2220">and she tried to get the hospital, she thought</p>
<p t="5879800" d="4260">";While I am walking my dog, you know, well maybe I could take one of these patients out for a walk";</p>
<p t="5884060" d="3420">you know, and she had been talking to the hospital administrators trying to get her,</p>
<p t="5887480" d="4280">allow her to go, you know, take out one of these patients and go for a walk with her dog.</p>
<p t="5891760" d="4280">and basically she had come to the behaviour therapy unit because that's what she wanted to do, it's like</p>
<p t="5896220" d="3680">Man, that person, she just blew me away, like, it's like</p>
<p t="5900100" d="4160">I just couldn't believe it, like, she had nothing going for her</p>
<p t="5904260" d="840">like nothing</p>
<p t="5905120" d="5120">and yet, she wanted to, you know help some people that were worse off, and like</p>
<p t="5910240" d="3160">there just weren't that many people that were worse off than her</p>
<p t="5913760" d="2180">Mind boggling, mind boggling!</p>
<p t="5916180" d="1500">I never forgot it.</p>
<p t="5918460" d="3040">and it really, really blew me away</p>
<p t="5921660" d="4000">you know there are opportunities for elevating your sights</p>
<p t="5926040" d="4160">within your realm of capability wherever you happen to be, and</p>
<p t="5930360" d="4200">and that's interesting, it's strange that that is the case</p>
<p t="5938140" d="7000">[reading] ";She brings those who love";, that's what that's should say, "; the sweet fulfillment of their longing";</p>
<p t="5945140" d="4180">";Like a bolt out of the blue, Fate"; characterized here as feminine</p>
<p t="5949320" d="4680">and that's what happens in the movie, the movie has got a Christian underbelly, like</p>
<p t="5954000" d="4240">it's quite pronounced but it's really a pagan movie in many ways, so for example</p>
<p t="5958420" d="2080">there is no blue fairy</p>
<p t="5960500" d="3940">and the reason I am speaking of Christianity of course is because this movie was</p>
<p t="5964440" d="3620">created in a culture where Christianity was still reasonably intact</p>
<p t="5968060" d="2960">and of course it was fully informed by that, but</p>
<p t="5971020" d="6120">the underlying mythos is not precisely Christian even though it is informed by Christian imagery</p>
<p t="5977400" d="2880">There is this old idea, I think it's  an Gnostic idea that</p>
<p t="5980280" d="5420">the wisdom of God is feminine, something like that, an anima, which means soul is feminine</p>
<p t="5986100" d="2960">and so there is an idea like that lurking here</p>
<p t="5989060" d="5700">and anyways, that's fate, and that's the blue fairy in this particular movie, you know she comes down from this star, which is</p>
<p t="5995380" d="3200">kind of makes her a avatar of God, that's the idea</p>
<p t="5998580" d="3920">and she's the transformative agent, she's really Mother Nature</p>
<p t="6002500" d="2180">you know in her positive guise, and</p>
<p t="6004900" d="1760">that's why she can animate</p>
<p t="6006660" d="3920">to animate something means to infuse it with soul, that's what it means</p>
<p t="6010580" d="4960">and she animates Pinocchio, right, she is the force that frees him from his strings</p>
<p t="6015540" d="1540">and so that's her, Fate,</p>
<p t="6017080" d="4500">[reading] ";Like a bolt out of the blue, Fate steps in and sees you through";</p>
<p t="6021600" d="3040">Well what that means, it means something like</p>
<p t="6024640" d="2400">It means something like this, is that</p>
<p t="6027040" d="5680">if you orient properly in the world, and we will say that you do that by trying to attain</p>
<p t="6032720" d="4760">the ultimate goal whatever that happens to be, then it is as if the world is on your side</p>
<p t="6037760" d="1440">and, and,</p>
<p t="6039200" d="3580">and things go well for you and I also believe that that is true because</p>
<p t="6042780" d="5180">certainly one of the things that more or less self evident is that generally speaking, if you tell the truth</p>
<p t="6047960" d="3740">things go a lot better for you, and, the reason for that is, well, heh</p>
<p t="6051700" d="3180">you want to be, do you want to have reality opposed to you?</p>
<p t="6054880" d="4340">Or do you want to have reality backing you up? It's like it's a pretty straight forward question</p>
<p t="6059220" d="5000">If you are truthful to the degree that you can be truthful, then reality is on your side</p>
<p t="6064220" d="3440">That's a good thing because there is a lot of it and there isn't much of you</p>
<p t="6067780" d="7360">Whereas if you take a  deceitful approach to things, well, then you're challenging reality</p>
<p t="6075140" d="2260">It's like, good luck with that, man!</p>
<p t="6077400" d="5960">It's like you are holding a plastic ruler in front your face and bending it, you know, and at some point</p>
<p t="6083360" d="4060">you are going to let go and it's going to, all that force that you have</p>
<p t="6087420" d="4260">stored up, and it's going to snap back and nail you  and that happens</p>
<p t="6092380" d="5920">Like, I have just never seen anyone, in my clinical practice, ever get away with anything</p>
<p t="6098900" d="640">Nothing!</p>
<p t="6099540" d="4680">And it's not surprising, it's like, if you are going to mess with the structure of reality</p>
<p t="6104220" d="6400">Like it's going to mess back, and it does, and it might not happen for years, and you might not even notice the connection</p>
<p t="6110620" d="2720">I mean part of what you do in psychotherapy, is actually</p>
<p t="6113340" d="4160">make those connections, it's like why did this horrible thing happen to me</p>
<p t="6117760" d="640">Well,</p>
<p t="6118940" d="720">Who knows?</p>
<p t="6119660" d="4400">It's like let's take it apart, well who knows how far back we have to go</p>
<p t="6124060" d="6260">It might even have things to do not even with you, it might have things to do with the errors in parents relationship</p>
<p t="6130460" d="500">Like,</p>
<p t="6131700" d="3800">you just can't mess with the structure of reality, it</p>
<p t="6135700" d="4500">It stays warped until you straighten it out, and</p>
<p t="6140700" d="1360">it's not good.</p>
<p t="6142300" d="6040">So, so there and injunction here which is that, you know, if you follow this path, you</p>
<p t="6148780" d="4800">pick a high goal and, and you put your heart in it, you know you commit to it</p>
<p t="6154780" d="6560">believe in it, believe means to love, believe and belove, it's the same thing, it's means to act out</p>
<p t="6161340" d="5800">and that's what the belief means,  like we think that belief means to accept a set of propositions as true</p>
<p t="6167220" d="2400">Well that is one form of belief, but</p>
<p t="6169620" d="6040">that's more like factual knowledge, right, belief is more like you decide that you are going to act something out</p>
<p t="6175660" d="4560">you make a decision and then you act it out and that is a reflection of you belief</p>
<p t="6180220" d="3500">You know, you are staking yourself on something, do you know?</p>
<p t="6184480" d="7000">Well no! Because you can't, you can't know, you are bounded by ignorance, you can make your best guess and move forward</p>
<p t="6191480" d="4260">and you can do that with commitment, but you have to believe in order to do that</p>
<p t="6197680" d="1920">I guess that's why it's a wish</p>
<p t="6200360" d="1560">Ok, so fine</p>
<p t="6202740" d="8560">Well then we have Jiminy Cricket, Southern U.S. slang for Jesus Christ, by the way and the initial overlap isn't</p>
<p t="6211300" d="5220">a fluke, I mean I am sure that the animators thought that that was funny, and of course it is funny and it</p>
<p t="6216800" d="3440">you know in the Lion King, you know that, that baboon</p>
<p t="6220540" d="7440">whose the shaman, basically, well to begin with he was kind of just a comic relief character, like a fool, you know, but</p>
<p t="6227980" d="5780">One of the things that Jung mentioned about the fool is that, the fool tends to turn into the saviour and it's an archetypal reality</p>
<p t="6233760" d="2660">Bugs Bunny is sort of like that, you know, he is a trickster</p>
<p t="6237500" d="5600">and, as the movie developed the character of the fool baboon took on the full fledged</p>
<p t="6243480" d="2480">you know , shaman priest element, and</p>
<p t="6245960" d="3880">and, you know, OK, Jiminy Cricket he is this little cricket and,</p>
<p t="6249840" d="5500">and he turns out to be the conscience which is pretty damn weird, it's like a bug is your conscience</p>
<p t="6255600" d="7460">and the bug is J.C. and, that a very strange juxtaposition of ideas, conscience, insect</p>
<p t="6264300" d="2560">saviour, it's like what's up with that</p>
<p t="6267080" d="3860">and so, well, what bugs you, that's part of it</p>
<p t="6271220" d="3280">Well, your conscience certainly bugs you</p>
<p t="6274500" d="4500">and you should pay attention to it's, it's just niggling little annoying thing that you can't</p>
<p t="6279000" d="2920">quite, you can override it, right, obviously</p>
<p t="6282240" d="7380">but, it's this, well, he says when he talks to Pinocchio later, it's that still small voice, you know</p>
<p t="6289620" d="3080">and, I have asked people before, like in my personality class, like</p>
<p t="6292700" d="2560">because conscience is a weird thing, and it</p>
<p t="6295260" d="2480">and like , if I said to you</p>
<p t="6297740" d="3940">if you are about to do something that you know you shouldn't do.</p>
<p t="6301680" d="5940">Do you have a voice in your head that tells you that you shouldn't do it? So how many people have had that experience?</p>
<p t="6307880" d="6320">OK, OK, good, now so other people have a feeling instead of a voice, and so, is there anybody here</p>
<p t="6314200" d="4100">who's willing to admit it, who has neither the feeling, neither the voice?</p>
<p t="6318500" d="5680">OK, so, you know it's a very understudied phenomena in psychology, this conscience,</p>
<p t="6324180" d="2180">I mean people can be conscientious,</p>
<p t="6326360" d="3020">and maybe those are people who listen to their conscience more</p>
<p t="6329380" d="2940">I don't know, but nobody has ever investigated it, and</p>
<p t="6332320" d="5320">the fact that do this little voice, whatever it is inside your head, it's like, what the hell is up with that?</p>
<p t="6337640" d="3320">You know, it doesn't tell you what you want to hear.</p>
<p t="6340960" d="6600">At least as far as I can tell, now you could say, ";Well that's the internal representation of society operating within you.";</p>
<p t="6347560" d="2420">That would be a Freudian view, that's the superego</p>
<p t="6349980" d="2020">and certainly there is something to that</p>
<p t="6352260" d="500">but,</p>
<p t="6352760" d="4900">I don't think that it is necessary to presume that that's all there is to it and even if it is</p>
<p t="6357660" d="4440">you still wouldn't have the voice, if you didn't have the biological potential</p>
<p t="6362120" d="2560">to have that voice embed itself in you.</p>
<p t="6364680" d="4100">So even if it is socioculturally constructed, which it is in part,</p>
<p t="6368780" d="5320">It's like language, it's like your language is socioculturally constructed but the reason you can speak</p>
<p t="6374100" d="5120">is because human beings can speak and if you have a conscience, it's because human beings have a conscience,</p>
<p t="6379220" d="4920">and the contents of that conscience might differ, but the fact that it exists</p>
<p t="6384620" d="1200">seem to me to be</p>
<p t="6386600" d="3120">universal. OK, well, so that's the conscience</p>
<p t="6390260" d="500">and,</p>
<p t="6391000" d="1520">that's Jiminy Cricket</p>
<p t="6392520" d="3620">and then the cricket opens this book, then you look at the book</p>
<p t="6396140" d="2280">and you think, ";Well what kind of book is that?";</p>
<p t="6398420" d="2060">Well it's got a spot light on it,</p>
<p t="6400480" d="3700">so, it's being highlighted, this is an important book,  and what kind of book is it?</p>
<p t="6404180" d="5120">Well, it's leather bound, it has a lock on it, you know, it's not some cheap book, it's kind of like a</p>
<p t="6409300" d="4120">you might think about it , it looks like something from an old library, or maybe it looks biblical</p>
<p t="6413420" d="4400">Whatever! It's a major league book, and this bug is the introduction to the book</p>
<p t="6417820" d="3520">So does that mean your conscience is the introduction to the book?</p>
<p t="6421380" d="500">Well?</p>
<p t="6421880" d="3880">Maybe that is what it means, it's certainly what's being played out in the movie.</p>
<p t="6425760" d="4480">Well then, the cricket opens the book and so then what do you see? Well, what does that look like?</p>
<p t="6432000" d="3280">What does it look like? What does it remind you of?</p>
<p t="6439060" d="2400">OK, so that's the Van Gogh painting.</p>
<p t="6442260" d="1680">It's the Nativity scene.</p>
<p t="6444160" d="2420">It's the Christmas star!</p>
<p t="6446580" d="4100">And you know that because what's going to happen? Well the hero is going to be born</p>
<p t="6450820" d="3200">That's what happens and so a star signifies that</p>
<p t="6454500" d="3760">Why does a star signify the birth of an infant? Let's say.</p>
<p t="6458400" d="5120">Well because there is something miraculous about the birth of an infant, and</p>
<p t="6463520" d="3820">why would the infant be a saviour? Which is the Christian notion, say.</p>
<p t="6467400" d="3200">Well because that's the infant is, potentially</p>
<p t="6471080" d="960">Every infant.</p>
<p t="6472040" d="2780">and so that's how you should act about them</p>
<p t="6474820" d="3200">and you know one of the things that really is interesting about having little kids</p>
<p t="6478020" d="2480">And I loved having little kids, is that,</p>
<p t="6480500" d="5140">You have this opportunity, to have this pristine relationship with someone, like</p>
<p t="6485640" d="3660">Like a relationship you have never had with anyone, because the kid really</p>
<p t="6489300" d="1360">is just there to love you</p>
<p t="6490660" d="2600">If you don't screw it up, you've got that</p>
<p t="6493260" d="4900">and then you can keep that going, you know, and you can try keep that relationship</p>
<p t="6498360" d="4480">like, pristine, and that's so fun, it's so fun to try to do that, it's</p>
<p t="6503640" d="880">It's really,</p>
<p t="6504680" d="2720">it's amazing, it's an amazing thing, and</p>
<p t="6507640" d="2960">you know kids get a bad rap in our society, but</p>
<p t="6510600" d="2660">it's an amazing thing to have little kids</p>
<p t="6513660" d="5680">and they are remarkable and they give you back far more than they require from you, and</p>
<p t="6519360" d="3480">partly because they treat you like, you're</p>
<p t="6523320" d="4720">valuable beyond belief, that's what the kid think about you, it's like</p>
<p t="6528700" d="1360">That's pretty good.</p>
<p t="6530060" d="6220">So, yeah, it's like something divine is going to happen and so, OK fine, you know, fair enough!</p>
<p t="6537680" d="7000">Well there is the star signifying that, and that's associated with  in some way with this star that you are supposed to wish upon</p>
<p t="6544680" d="2040">Well that's kind of odd, there's this</p>
<p t="6546720" d="6280">There is this relationship that is implicit, the star that signifies the birth of the hero is the same star that you wish upon</p>
<p t="6553220" d="840">Well,</p>
<p t="6555380" d="6000">perhaps the star that you are wishing upon is the wish that the hero will be born in your soul</p>
<p t="6561380" d="6020">It's something like that, you are aiming at an ideal, it's the ideal you, whatever that would be, well?</p>
<p t="6567400" d="2480">You can certainly figure out what it isn't.</p>
<p t="6570080" d="2800">That's where you start, as far as I can tell</p>
<p t="6572880" d="2180">You know what you shouldn't be doing,</p>
<p t="6575060" d="4260">and you could at least stop doing those things, and then see what happens, you know</p>
<p t="6579320" d="2520">If you ask yourself, it's a meditative exercise, you know</p>
<p t="6581840" d="4140">And you do this with the autobiography  to some degree, it's like, OK</p>
<p t="6585980" d="2900">Sit down for ten minutes and have a little dialogue with yourself</p>
<p t="6588880" d="2860">Like you actually wanted to know the answer, you know</p>
<p t="6592020" d="1040">So, you ask!</p>
<p t="6593060" d="7000">";Well I am probably doing something stupid that if I could quit doing my life would be better, that I could quit doing, that I would quit doing.";</p>
<p t="6600060" d="4900">And maybe it's not a very big thing, because you are not very disciplined, but maybe there is something?</p>
<p t="6604960" d="3860">Ask yourself that question, man, you will have an answer in no time flat.</p>
<p t="6608920" d="10320">Like, ";I should stop doing this, well yeah, yeah, I know, and I could, and I won't, or maybe I would but if I did, I know my life would be better";</p>
<p t="6619240" d="4060">It's like, you could figure that out immediately, and if you do that a hundred times</p>
<p t="6623300" d="3540">Well, you  will be in way better shape.  So if you don't know what</p>
<p t="6626840" d="4760">to do that is good, you could at least figure out what you shouldn't do that's just moronically</p>
<p t="6631600" d="4520">you know, pathetic, and you can be sure you're doing at least a dozen of thoee things at least</p>
<p t="6636220" d="3420">You know, procrastinating or, you know</p>
<p t="6639640" d="6480">you know, that's what the conscience tells you, and if you ask it, it will just tell you why you are, you know, are stupid and insufficient.</p>
<p t="6646740" d="2600">And so, who wants to hear that? But</p>
<p t="6649580" d="2880">but, maybe you could do something about it.</p>
<p t="6653680" d="5120">Ok, so the cricket comes into the village there and he sees this little house, and</p>
<p t="6658800" d="4360">there is a little fire in it, and so, it's kind of got, it's a welcoming place, it's a light in the darkness</p>
<p t="6663160" d="4480">this house, just like the star, and so, he hops towards it, and then he ends up inside it, and</p>
<p t="6667640" d="3320">you know, there is a nice fire, you get to see the inside, and</p>
<p t="6670960" d="5540">the inside is cozy, you know, it's welcoming, and then when you look around you see that everything is kind of</p>
<p t="6676500" d="3280">in it's place, it's not hyper-organized or any thing like that, it's</p>
<p t="6679780" d="3720">it's friendly and welcoming and it's, there is a lot of wood and there is a nice fire and</p>
<p t="6683500" d="5400">then there are toys everywhere, and they are well constructed, so you know that whoever lives there likes children</p>
<p t="6688900" d="5340">and so, if someone likes children, well, someone that doesn't like children, it's like, you should run away from them very rapidly</p>
<p t="6694240" d="3380">but if they like children, well then that's a good sign that, you know</p>
<p t="6697620" d="4840">Jesus, they are a least human, it's a start you know, and then these things are all</p>
<p t="6702460" d="6680">high quality, they are made very well, and, then there's, and he is looking around to see all of this and there's</p>
<p t="6709320" d="3680">there's toys and clocks, and they are all hand made, and</p>
<p t="6713000" d="3520">so he is sort of infers that maybe there is a wood carver who lives there, and</p>
<p t="6716520" d="2840">a wood carver is someone who can build things, and</p>
<p t="6719360" d="4900">and it you build things that work and that are beautiful, that's a kind of truth, right? It's like</p>
<p t="6724460" d="6960">it's built right into the object, that's what quality is, quality is the building into an object of truth</p>
<p t="6731420" d="4200">the thing works, it does what it is supposed to, it has integrity, and so</p>
<p t="6735620" d="1560">you see that everywhere in here, and</p>
<p t="6737180" d="4160">So you are getting the sense of, that the film makers are setting the stage</p>
<p t="6741740" d="500">and so,</p>
<p t="6742240" d="5100">well so they set the stage by showing you the stage and the cricket tells you what he sees, and he's</p>
<p t="6747340" d="1400">pretty happy to be there, because</p>
<p t="6748740" d="5540">and this is also someone who is concerned about time, right, because there are a lot of clocks, there are a lot of clocks</p>
<p t="6754280" d="3600">And so, time turns out to be an important sub-element of this story</p>
<p t="6757880" d="4780">And then he sees the puppet, he's a marionette, and so, what's a marionette?</p>
<p t="6762660" d="3100">Well a marionette, and he's sitting on the shelf.</p>
<p t="6765880" d="4720">A marionette is something that is quasi-animated, because it can move</p>
<p t="6770600" d="3380">It doesn't really have a soul, but sort of acts like it has a soul</p>
<p t="6774960" d="2800">In the sense of anima and soul and animated, and,</p>
<p t="6777760" d="2520">but a marionette is something that is being</p>
<p t="6780280" d="2860">manipulated by something else behind the scenes</p>
<p t="6783140" d="2260">Right, it doesn't have it's own volition</p>
<p t="6785880" d="3840">It's dependent on the will of something behind the scenes</p>
<p t="6789720" d="5340">And so, there is a strong implication that whatever this thing is, it's half formed</p>
<p t="6795360" d="5320">and that it's, being manipulated by unseen forces behind</p>
<p t="6801700" d="1440">unseen forces</p>
<p t="6803720" d="1200">behind the facade</p>
<p t="6805120" d="6480">Well that is a Freudian idea, that's you, that's all of you, you know, you're pulled hither and fro</p>
<p t="6811600" d="3080">by unconscious forces, and some of those are biological</p>
<p t="6814680" d="3660">and some of them are cultural, you know, and you think about people who are swept</p>
<p t="6818340" d="6440">up in great ideological movements, like the communists or the fascists, those people are marionettes</p>
<p t="6824780" d="5100">That's exactly what they are, they all say the same thing, they all mouth the same words</p>
<p t="6829880" d="3220">they all act the same way, and something is behind it</p>
<p t="6833100" d="1760">and the question is, what?</p>
<p t="6834860" d="3640">Well that is the question and that's partly what this movie tries to figure out. So,</p>
<p t="6838660" d="5220">you see this marionette, he's a half formed wooden headed puppet</p>
<p t="6843880" d="4840">and he has a little bit of potential, you know, and the cricket goes up and interacts with him</p>
<p t="6848720" d="4120">and sees that he is made out of pretty good wood, and makes a little joke about having a wooden head</p>
<p t="6852840" d="2900">and you know, that's kind of obvious what that means, and</p>
<p t="6855740" d="2860">you notice that the cricket is dressed like a tramp</p>
<p t="6858600" d="5040">and when you first saw him, he wasn't, he was dressed like a 1920's millionaire</p>
<p t="6863960" d="4160">So, but here he is a tramp, and this is so interesting, it's like</p>
<p t="6868720" d="4400">So this bug, that's a messiah, that's the introduction to the book</p>
<p t="6873120" d="5040">that's the conscience, is also a tramp with no home, it's like, what does that mean?</p>
<p t="6878160" d="2980">And it took me a long time to sort that out, and it's like</p>
<p t="6881740" d="4160">He has been everywhere, this tramp he has been everywhere, and</p>
<p t="6885980" d="6080">and he know, he's traveled the world, and, but he doesn't have a place, he doesn't have a home</p>
<p t="6892060" d="5120">He hasn't made a relationship with anything real yet, he is kind of a potential</p>
<p t="6897180" d="3120">And this is one of the things that is really interesting  about this movie because</p>
<p t="6900520" d="3980">if you think about the cricket as a fragment of the hero</p>
<p t="6905240" d="5140">and say, a reflection of the saviour, which is his relationship with J.C., of course</p>
<p t="6910460" d="2720">and the person who introduces the book</p>
<p t="6914060" d="2640">then the story gets strange, because</p>
<p t="6916700" d="4240">if it was merely a representation of the perfect person, the archetype of the hero</p>
<p t="6920940" d="3240">then the conscience would know everything, right?</p>
<p t="6924180" d="3560">And it would just tell the puppet what to do, and that would be the end of it</p>
<p t="6927740" d="5700">But that's a dull story, it's like, perfect conscience comes along, puppet does everything it says</p>
<p t="6934480" d="1600">Bingo! Perfection.</p>
<p t="6936080" d="4940">But that isn't what happens, there is this weird idea that this thing that has got all these attributes</p>
<p t="6942380" d="6880">Needs a home, and has to enter into a learning relationship with the thing that it's trying to transform</p>
<p t="6949260" d="5260">It's so sophisticated, because I could say, ";You should do what your conscience tells you.";</p>
<p t="6954520" d="4200">It's like, well maybe not, maybe that's not exactly how it works</p>
<p t="6958720" d="5200">maybe your conscience isn't omniscient and omnipotent, maybe it's not God, right?</p>
<p t="6964120" d="4360">It's a guide, but it's maybe smarter than you sometimes</p>
<p t="6968480" d="2140">Maybe because it's society in your head</p>
<p t="6970620" d="4960">and obviously it's smarter than you sometimes because it tells you not to do something and you go do it and then</p>
<p t="6975580" d="3420">You get into trouble and you think, ";Well if I would have just listened.";</p>
<p t="6979000" d="4960">but you don't, and that is interesting too, it's something that you don't have to listen to</p>
<p t="6983960" d="5320">which is, seems to be associated with free will, it's weird, if your conscience knows what to do</p>
<p t="6989280" d="3900">why aren't you just a deterministic puppet of your conscience</p>
<p t="6993180" d="4980">Christ! That would work a lot better, you wouldn't have to torture yourself, and you wouldn't make any mistakes, so</p>
<p t="6998160" d="1280">why the separation?</p>
<p t="6999960" d="3360">Well maybe it's because the conscience is generic</p>
<p t="7003320" d="6920">and so it has to be taught, it has to learn too, and so what you do is you have a dialogue with your conscience</p>
<p t="7010240" d="3940">it's something like that, and you expose yourself, to more and more of the world, and</p>
<p t="7014480" d="4560">you get wiser and your conscience gets wiser and you  mature together</p>
<p t="7019040" d="4820">and that's what happens in this story because the cricket starts out as a, this tramp</p>
<p t="7023860" d="5060">you know, that is smarter than the puppet, but not as smart as he thinks he is, that's for sure</p>
<p t="7028920" d="5940">and, when he first starts to operate as a conscience he is a completely useless at it, he babbles of a lot of cliches</p>
<p t="7035020" d="3920">about morality and then, he's late the first day for his job, and</p>
<p t="7038940" d="1600">he's just not very good at it, and so</p>
<p t="7040540" d="5460">there is this weird idea that the conscience which is part of which puts you towards redemption</p>
<p t="7046000" d="2880">is something that you actually have to interact with</p>
<p t="7048880" d="3700">over the course of your life in order for it to develop as you develop</p>
<p t="7052580" d="5640">and, so then I would also say that the cricket represents at least in part what Jung described as the self</p>
<p t="7058300" d="2020">which is like the potential</p>
<p t="7060320" d="5540">fully developed human being that sort of exists within you as a possibility, but it has to be</p>
<p t="7065860" d="3480">It has to be manifested in the actual conditions of your life</p>
<p t="7069500" d="4400">and the conscience has to learn how to position itself here and now</p>
<p t="7073900" d="3160">and it's got generic advice, and that's not good enough</p>
<p t="7077060" d="3900">and so that's why the cricket is looking for a home, and so, he needs a home.</p>
<p t="7080960" d="6420">Even though he is all these other things we already says he was, he has to find a specific home before he can become</p>
<p t="7087600" d="2120">who he could be</p>
<p t="7089720" d="5700">Well so,  then Geppeto shows up, and he is kindly old guy, which is pretty much exactly what you would expect, and</p>
<p t="7095420" d="4680">you know, he's a careful craftsman and he likes kittens, and you know, that's always a good thing</p>
<p t="7101820" d="3620">and he has some fish, and you know he's</p>
<p t="7105440" d="5620">good at making things, and he has got a sense of humour and he is kind of playful and so he is the good father</p>
<p t="7111060" d="6080">fundamentally, he's the wise king, he's the positive archetype of the masculine, and that's what he is</p>
<p t="7117140" d="6280">and so he is culture in it's positive manifestation, and he gives rise to this creation which is his puppet</p>
<p t="7123420" d="4760">which is what culture does, because you are a puppet of your culture, a marionette of your culture</p>
<p t="7128360" d="3400">and so maybe you could be more than that</p>
<p t="7131760" d="5580">and that's the other thing that is strange about this movie and it's strange about the mythological way of looking at the world</p>
<p t="7137340" d="1120">because scientifically</p>
<p t="7139120" d="4360">deterministically, there is nature and there is culture</p>
<p t="7143480" d="4380">and you are the deterministic product of the interaction between nauture and culture</p>
<p t="7147860" d="3160">there is nothing else to you than that, that's that!</p>
<p t="7151020" d="3900">But the mythological world doesn't say that, it says something different</p>
<p t="7154920" d="4060">It says that there is nature and culture, and then there is you!</p>
<p t="7159840" d="4100">And the you that's in there has choices and a destiny</p>
<p t="7163940" d="5300">and that you actually affect the interplay of nature and culture in determining your own character</p>
<p t="7169480" d="7000">and it insists upon that, the oldest stories we have, there is always the hero and the archetypal mother and the archetypal father</p>
<p t="7176480" d="3360">there is always those three things, there is never just two</p>
<p t="7179840" d="6900">So, from the narrative perspective, there is always implication that there is something autonomous about</p>
<p t="7186740" d="6800">the hero of the story, and, you know, you can't account for that, we don't have a good way accounting that</p>
<p t="7193540" d="5220">for that from a scientific perspective, I was having a discussion with Sam Harris the other day which,</p>
<p t="7198900" d="1580">was very</p>
<p t="7203140" d="7000">what would you say, he said we got wrapped around an axle, which is pretty much, Sam Harris is one of the four famous, you know</p>
<p t="7210620" d="6140">atheists along with Christopher Hitchens and Richard Dawkins and Dan Dennet, yeah</p>
<p t="7216760" d="5500">and so we were having a discussion and, he is a determinist just right down to the bottom</p>
<p t="7222260" d="3960">it's like you are determined, you are determined, there is no free will</p>
<p t="7226220" d="3840">You're a deterministic machine and, you know, if you are a coherent scientist and you are</p>
<p t="7230280" d="6480">a Newtonian, roughly speaking, you don't really have much choice other than to think that way, but that isn't how it seems to people!</p>
<p t="7236880" d="4060">And we don't treat each other that way, and our entire legal system is predicated</p>
<p t="7241180" d="2960">on the idea that you do in fact have free will!</p>
<p t="7244800" d="5520">So, well, can we account for it? Well no, and do we have a scientific model for it? No.</p>
<p t="7250320" d="6460">But then I would also say that we do not have a scientific model for consciousness, we don't know a damn thing about conciousness</p>
<p t="7256780" d="4460">Which is why Dan Dennet's book, which was called ";Consciousness Explained";</p>
<p t="7261240" d="4360">was referred to by its critics as ";Consciousness Explained Away";</p>
<p t="7265600" d="4380">Which is exactly right as far as I am concerned, because he took a mechanistic approach and</p>
<p t="7269980" d="2180">I just don't think you get to do that, because</p>
<p t="7272160" d="2800">there is something really weird about consciousness, I mean</p>
<p t="7275180" d="7000">the phenomanologists like Heidegger, who tried to radically transform Western philosophy, right from the bottom up</p>
<p t="7282180" d="5920">He basically said, ";Well, you know, you can treat the world as if consciousness is primary and that</p>
<p t="7288180" d="3520">human experience is reality, that's reality</p>
<p t="7291700" d="5140">and that it down't exist independently of consciousness in any explicable way";</p>
<p t="7296840" d="3660">It's like, well,  what's out there if there is nothing to experience it.</p>
<p t="7300500" d="5480">Well everything at once, it is something like that, it's not really comprehensible, as</p>
<p t="7305980" d="4620">without a subject, the subject defines it and makes it real. Now you don't have to believe that but</p>
<p t="7311040" d="7000">at least I am telling you that there are thoroughly coherent philosophical positions that make that case</p>
<p t="7318480" d="6480">very strongly, and that allow consciousness to exist as a phenomena and to take it seriously, and</p>
<p t="7324960" d="5740">you certainly act like you take it seriously, you act like there is a you and you make choices and</p>
<p t="7330700" d="2400">you certainly treat other people that way</p>
<p t="7333100" d="3780">deterministic or not, you are still going to get angry when, you know, rude to you, and</p>
<p t="7336880" d="2760">you are going to act as if they had some choice in the matter.</p>
<p t="7339640" d="6900">Now maybe that's an illusion, possibly, but maybe it's not.  And I would say the oldest stories that we have</p>
<p t="7346880" d="6320">always include that as not only the a fundamental element, but even as the fundemental element</p>
<p t="7353360" d="3920">So, well so, you can think about that how ever you want, but</p>
<p t="7357280" d="3820">Anyways, so Geppetto, comes along and he is going to finish off the puppet</p>
<p t="7361360" d="4720">And so what does he do to finish off the puppet, he gives it a voice!</p>
<p t="7366080" d="3840">He gives it a mouth! Well that's really really interesting, so</p>
<p t="7370480" d="2080">In Genesis, in Genesis</p>
<p t="7372780" d="6400">this is a very very complex idea, and it took people thousands of years to figure this idea out</p>
<p t="7379500" d="2160">and it's something like this, so</p>
<p t="7381660" d="7000">At the beginning of everything there was chaos, and that was like potential, it was something like potential</p>
<p t="7388880" d="5040">the potential for being, and God who is God the Father in the Genesis account</p>
<p t="7394100" d="8380">uses a faculty that he has, which is the word, to call being from chaos.</p>
<p t="7402700" d="5440">And that's the creation of being, right, it's the manifestation order from chaos</p>
<p t="7409760" d="6800">and it's the word, the Logos, that,  it's the Logos that's the tool that God uses to do that and that Logos</p>
<p t="7416560" d="5840">in Christianity is associated with Christ, which is a very weird thing, but the reason for that is that</p>
<p t="7422440" d="5040">there is an idea that the divine element of the individual</p>
<p t="7427580" d="6960">is the thing that uses language, communicative language to call the world into being</p>
<p t="7434540" d="6440">And that is what we do, as far we can tell, you make a decision, you think it through, you talk it over with your friends</p>
<p t="7440980" d="5000">you plot a course and the world manifests itself in relationship to you choice</p>
<p t="7445980" d="4980">and it's for that reason, and it is for that reason that in Genesis and many other accounts</p>
<p t="7450960" d="6140">that Logos capacity is identified with human beings, it's like you have a small bit of that in you</p>
<p t="7457100" d="3780">whatever that means and you participate in the process of</p>
<p t="7460880" d="5840">continually generating order out of chaos, and sometimes the reverse, you mediate between them</p>
<p t="7466880" d="7200">And so, that in our, in Western culture, and it is certainly the case in other cultures as well, that</p>
<p t="7474120" d="5360">that's why you have rights! Fundamentally, that's why the law has to respect you</p>
<p t="7479500" d="7560">is because you have got this spark of divinity in you, that's transcendent, that nobody gets to transgress against</p>
<p t="7487060" d="5180">And you say, ";Well, do you believe that?"; It's like, well, you act like you believe it!</p>
<p t="7492240" d="4400">You treat other people like you believe it, or they are not very happy with you</p>
<p t="7496640" d="6640">So, it depends on what you mean, by believe, well you act it out. Well, do you accept it as a proposition? Well,</p>
<p t="7503280" d="5860">I don't care if you accept it as a proposition frankly, because I think the best indicator of what you believe</p>
<p t="7509240" d="2080">is how you act, not what you say.</p>
<p t="7511320" d="3680">Because what do you know about what you know, hardly anything.</p>
<p t="7516140" d="6980">And so, actions speak louder than words and if you want to be treated properly by someone is that you want to treat them</p>
<p t="7523120" d="6220">You want them to treat you as a valuable autonomous entity, that's what you want</p>
<p t="7529340" d="3300">And, so maybe you're not that, maybe you are a deterministic puppet</p>
<p t="7532680" d="7000">and what this strange movie suggests is that you are a kind of deterministic puppet but you don't have to be</p>
<p t="7539880" d="640">Alright,</p>
<p t="7540520" d="5840">well the mouth goes on, and then Geppetto is happy about that and then they have a little dance, you know, they</p>
<p t="7546360" d="3760">They turn the music on and all these little music boxes, and</p>
<p t="7550120" d="2380">they all play together and it's like</p>
<p t="7552500" d="4700">harmony of some sort has been established, because that's what the music represents, and</p>
<p t="7557200" d="6540">there are layers of reality that are communicating with one another because that's what the music represents and then they have a little dance</p>
<p t="7563920" d="5640">and the idea is that, well it's a good thing to let this puppet have it's own voice</p>
<p t="7569560" d="5440">Well that's an interesting idea because what the  hell does it know, it's a wooden headed marionette</p>
<p t="7575000" d="2340">Why the hell would you want something like that to talk?</p>
<p t="7577340" d="3800">Well it's the same question you have in relationship to you children</p>
<p t="7581140" d="5560">It's like what do they know, they are two, or three, you know, they don't know anything</p>
<p t="7586700" d="6300">Well so should you just tyrannize them, and make them do everything that you want, or are you going to let them have a bit of a voice?</p>
<p t="7593400" d="4160">And the question is whether you want them to be a puppet, or not.</p>
<p t="7597560" d="5200">And if you don't want them to be a puppet, if you want them to grow up autonomous, then then you let them have a voice.</p>
<p t="7603100" d="3760">And you facilitate the development of that voice, and so</p>
<p t="7607120" d="4240">and that's, and that's what you do if you don't want a marionette</p>
<p t="7611360" d="6700">So, and Geppetto doesn't want a marionette, so he gives the puppet a voice, even though he knows it's just a puppet</p>
<p t="7618240" d="2240">and that it doesn't know anything</p>
<p t="7620480" d="4820">And then, this is fantastic, the cricket is sitting up there watching that, he is pretty happy with it</p>
<p t="7625300" d="5800">that's the first little scene you see there, and he is sitting by this other thing that is just not happy at all</p>
<p t="7631100" d="5120">And that's the terrible father, and you see it's a character that repeats throughout the</p>
<p t="7636220" d="4940">entire movie, you see manifestations of the tyrannical father continually through the movie</p>
<p t="7641160" d="2840">in different characters, it's like he is played out by different roles</p>
<p t="7644120" d="6720">And so, first of all the cricket is so thrilled about this, and then he looks at the frowning king there</p>
<p t="7650840" d="5860">Who is not happy that the puppet has been given a voice, he is a tyrant, right, he is the representation of a tyrant</p>
<p t="7656700" d="2180">and a tyrant does not want you to have a voice</p>
<p t="7658880" d="1980">And so, the cricket looks at him and says</p>
<p t="7660860" d="2460">";Well, you can't please everybody all the time";</p>
<p t="7663360" d="5680">and it's just a tiny little fragment of a joke, you know, but it's. There is this old idea</p>
<p t="7669040" d="5880">I think that it comes from Chekov, and the idea is that, if you set a play up, and there is a gun, a rifle</p>
<p t="7674920" d="6880">or a pistol on a table in the first act, it had better been used by the third act or it shouldn't have been there at all</p>
<p t="7682040" d="7680">And the idea is, you don't put anything in you play that's random, you never do that, it' like</p>
<p t="7689720" d="5000">because this isn't life, this isn't life this is a work of art and everything</p>
<p t="7694800" d="3820">is connected and it is there by intent</p>
<p t="7698680" d="7000">And so, this isn't accidental that this little king character doesn't like what is going on, or that he shows up.</p>
<p t="7706080" d="7000">So anyways, all the clocks go off and the music boxes go, and the have a little dance and everybody is happy about it</p>
<p t="7713080" d="6760">And then, Geppetto notices what time it is, and there is a tremendous emphasis on time in this part of the movie</p>
<p t="7719840" d="6020">Because there are all these clocks going off, and they are all telling him what time it is, like 30 clocks go off, and then he takes</p>
<p t="7725860" d="5480">watch out that and notices what time it is, it's like the idea that there is something about time</p>
<p t="7731540" d="5580">going on, is like whacked at you, you know dozens of times, so that you get it</p>
<p t="7737120" d="4620">And it's a little joke that he pulls out his watch and he figures out that it is time from bed</p>
<p t="7741740" d="5500">Well, so now we are making the transition between the conscious world and the unconscious  world</p>
<p t="7747660" d="6800">OK, so there is an intimation in the movie that everything that happens now is in the unconscious world</p>
<p t="7754460" d="6440">and the way you know that is that, it's strange, because the movie moves in and out this underworld</p>
<p t="7760900" d="3920">but at the very end when Pinocchio is transformed into a real boy</p>
<p t="7764820" d="6940">the last thing that Geppetto does is, I think that it's Geppetto, hit one of the pendulums and start all the clocks again</p>
<p t="7773640" d="4080">So it's as if, what happens from here onwards is part of a dream</p>
<p t="7777720" d="6680">Now it's murky because, Pinocchio goes to school, and you know, there is the next day and all of that, but</p>
<p t="7784400" d="4360">and so those are sort of realistic elements, but then there is the whole going down into the ocean</p>
<p t="7788760" d="3520">to find the whale thing that seems completely dreamlike</p>
<p t="7792280" d="4280">But there is an intimation that we are in a different kind of world, and so</p>
<p t="7796560" d="2660">They all go to sleep, including the cricket.</p>
<p t="7799920" d="3280">And so, then Geppetto notices the star!</p>
<p t="7803200" d="3600">And, because he is a good guy he makes a wish on the star and we have already</p>
<p t="7806800" d="5560">explained why you might wish on a star, and what that might mean, and he makes a very interesting wish.</p>
<p t="7814840" d="7000">It's not a self-serving wish, in fact it's quite the contrary, he doesn't wish that Pinocchio is an obediant son.</p>
<p t="7821840" d="3380">He doesn't wish that he produced someone who will work for him.</p>
<p t="7825220" d="4040">He doesn't wish any of that, he wishes for what a good father would wish.</p>
<p t="7829340" d="3440">Which is that the creation that he has brought forth</p>
<p t="7833360" d="2880">would develop it's capacity for autonomy.</p>
<p t="7836600" d="7000">He wants him to become real, he wants him to become an actual living creature and not and not a wooden headed marionette</p>
<p t="7843600" d="5240">And so you would say that is what your father should wish for you, you know, and I have clients</p>
<p t="7848840" d="4460">frequently whose father's weren't like that at all, they were tyrannical or they were negelectful or</p>
<p t="7853560" d="6320">or the punished the person every time they did something good, that's a real fun game.</p>
<p t="7860960" d="6980">They competed with them and undermined them at every opportunity, they didn't want to produce someone strong and autonomous</p>
<p t="7867940" d="1760">They wanted to</p>
<p t="7870260" d="4000">give birth to a slave and then diminish it as much as possible</p>
<p t="7874260" d="6600">And so, that's bad, it's not good, and so Geppetto is not like that, so he says, ";Well, I am going to wish for</p>
<p t="7880860" d="4400">something completely unreasonable";, which is part of that ideal idea, right?</p>
<p t="7886240" d="3120">And the unreasonable thing is that this puppet</p>
<p t="7889720" d="880">could become</p>
<p t="7891760" d="6560">real! Could actually take on it's autonomy and move forward. And so that's what he wishes.</p>
<p t="7899840" d="1600">And then they go to sleep</p>
<p t="7902920" d="7440">And then the cricket starts to become driven mad by the noises of the clock, so it's like he is going into this state of hyper-alertness</p>
<p t="7910660" d="4580">And the clocks are clanging at him and Geppetto is snoring and</p>
<p t="7915340" d="7860">he can even hear the little grains of sand falling out of the hourglass, he is becoming hyper-alert</p>
<p t="7923260" d="4340">And then he yells, ";Stop!";, and all the clocks stop</p>
<p t="7927600" d="6080">Which is a pretty good trick for a cricket, you know, he is the master of time but also we are in a place where time has</p>
<p t="7933680" d="2100">come to a stop, we are outside of time.</p>
<p t="7935780" d="5400">And one of the things that Freud pointed out about dreams is that, dreams are kind of outside of time.</p>
<p t="7941180" d="5060">Now, here is what that means, is first of all they draw on eternal themes, that's part of it</p>
<p t="7946240" d="5420">but you know, you must had had this experience, Freud noted this carefully in the ";Interpretation of Dreams"; where</p>
<p t="7951660" d="6580">you know you are sleeping and the alarm will go off,  and the alarm noise is incorporated into the dream</p>
<p t="7958240" d="6460">and it's like, the dream has been going on for an hour in subjective time, and you wake up and you realize that it is the alarm clock</p>
<p t="7964700" d="6900">It's like, and there is no reason why your dream time should be the same as real time because it is all going on in your imagination, but</p>
<p t="7971680" d="6880">It's amazing in some sense, how much can happen in such a short period of time in your imagination, and so</p>
<p t="7978560" d="5880">it's outside of time, the world of fantasy is in some sense outside of time, and so, the cricket</p>
<p t="7984640" d="2080">tells time to stop, and it does.</p>
<p t="7987920" d="5340">And then, the star, enlarges</p>
<p t="7993920" d="7460">and it turns into this blue fairy, whose got a celestial gown covered with stars</p>
<p t="8001380" d="5800">and who has got wings, so she is some kind of ethereal being and, like, you don't have a problem with that</p>
<p t="8008200" d="6960">in the movie, it's like, ";Yeah, sure, I mean you know, it's a fairy that came from a star, that makes perfect sense.";, which of course it's makes no sense</p>
<p t="8015160" d="1020">whatsoever</p>
<p t="8016180" d="3700">right, it makes no sense, but you are willing to go along with it because,</p>
<p t="8019880" d="4240">on the one hand it makes no sense, and on the other hand it makes perfect sense</p>
<p t="8024120" d="4840">It's like the fairy godmother idea, it's like, ";Yeah, yeah fairy godmother, no problem, we got that.";</p>
<p t="8029320" d="6380">And the idea there is that well, Nature comes to your aid, it's something like that,</p>
<p t="8035700" d="5200">It's the benevolent force of Nature is on you side, now, not obviously, only on your side</p>
<p t="8040920" d="3240">because it opposes you as well, but</p>
<p t="8044160" d="4660">And there is your own mother as well, who is also Nature whose on your side, and so</p>
<p t="8049380" d="5040">but there is an idea here and the idea is that if the father gets the wish right</p>
<p t="8055160" d="1760">the aim right for the child</p>
<p t="8057080" d="1840">then Nature will cooperate</p>
<p t="8059060" d="3920">Right, and that is true, I believe that that's true, is that</p>
<p t="8062980" d="4460">if you set up your relationship, your cultural relationship with your child properly</p>
<p t="8067440" d="5880">then they are far more likely to flourish, and so, you get the magic of Nature on your side, by</p>
<p t="8073320" d="6160">establishing the proper aim.  And so that's what happens, Geppetto says, well this is what I am aiming at</p>
<p t="8080040" d="7000">and because he is aiming at it, and because it is in the realm of possibility, maybe Nature comes to his service, and</p>
<p t="8087040" d="5400">that is how it works, that's exactly how it works because when you aim at something</p>
<p t="8092520" d="6160">then, you muster your biological forces towards that goal, and, if the goal is</p>
<p t="8099880" d="5440">feasible, and attainable, then you will cooperate with yourself</p>
<p t="8105440" d="3520">And so that's quite cool, Carl Rogers would call that</p>
<p t="8109400" d="1680">What's the word for that?</p>
<p t="8111660" d="3520">I think he called it genuineness which is kind of weak</p>
<p t="8115180" d="5400">but I think that is still what he called it, he sort of meant that, that's sort of what happens when your</p>
<p t="8121380" d="5280">goals and your physiological and biological being are alined well, and you're</p>
<p t="8126660" d="3120">and you can communicate both, you are not full of internal contradictions</p>
<p t="8129880" d="7560">And so, your conscious aims and your biological possibilities are manifesting themselves in the same direction</p>
<p t="8138020" d="1760">and so, that would be good!</p>
<p t="8139780" d="4480">So anyways, the fairy shows up and she is quite sexually attractive, she is quite provocative</p>
<p t="8144360" d="2220">and she charms the cricket</p>
<p t="8146980" d="5120">who gets all, blushes and like, is all, you know embarrased and</p>
<p t="8152640" d="7780">overwhelmed by this like figure of celestial beauty and decides to cooperate, the conscience decides to cooperate</p>
<p t="8160420" d="2420">and gets some responsibility, and so</p>
<p t="8163040" d="5140">the fairy allows the puppet to move without strings</p>
<p t="8168180" d="5560">So that's kind of interesting, it's the intervention of Nature. Culture focuses the aim,</p>
<p t="8173740" d="3580">and then it's the intervention of Nature that produces the autonomy</p>
<p t="8177320" d="4400">and that seems to be right, I mean even though it's not that understandable, it seems to be right.</p>
<p t="8181920" d="2140">And then, so, she</p>
<p t="8184060" d="5340">takes the strings off Pinocchio, and you might say well that's partly because your child is not</p>
<p t="8189400" d="5800">certainly not just a creature of culture, by no means, your child has a temperament, you'll see that right away</p>
<p t="8195260" d="2240">and that temperament will unfold</p>
<p t="8197800" d="7000">and hopefully it will unfold in a cultural context that's amenable to it, and that the combination of those two produce something new.</p>
<p t="8207500" d="800">He can talk,</p>
<p t="8210120" d="1060">he can walk</p>
<p t="8211500" d="3540">and so the good fairy basically tells him that</p>
<p t="8215040" d="2880">he has got a bit of autonomy and now it is up to him to</p>
<p t="8218420" d="7000">like clue in a bit, and act properly, and learn the difference between good and evil, and to speak truthfully and all of that, it's a bit</p>
<p t="8225420" d="6240">propagandistic that part of the movie, I would say, but it doesn't really matter it is kind of the inculcation of conventional morality</p>
<p t="8231660" d="3860">and, there's a fair bit to it, especially that he is supposed to tell the truth</p>
<p t="8235520" d="4560">and, you know, he says he will, and the cricket is listening, and then</p>
<p t="8241260" d="7000">the puppet asks, ";Well what does conscience mean?"; because the fairy says always let your conscience be your guide</p>
<p t="8248260" d="5020">and he says, ";Well what does conscience mean?"; and the bug, whose like all puffed up because he wants to impress the fairy</p>
<p t="8253280" d="5080">pops down and gets on his little matchbox and gives this like horrible little lecture about</p>
<p t="8258360" d="5780">how to behave properly, that's just like ideological chatter, you can hardly even stand listening to it, and</p>
<p t="8264280" d="5900">it's supposed to be like that, it's generic moral advice that anyone could give</p>
<p t="8270300" d="5880">that is kind of dull and also puffed up and grandiose, he's just not very good at it</p>
<p t="8276180" d="5320">So that's why he is on his little matchbox there, with his chest puffed out, and so</p>
<p t="8281500" d="2620">he says, ";That's just the trouble with the world today."; [sarcastic falsetto]</p>
<p t="8284120" d="2540">and I think that's his opening line, you know</p>
<p t="8286660" d="6080">He's diagnosing the whole world, and, you know, the fairy, she thinks he is kind of funny because he is</p>
<p t="8292740" d="4240">And you know , it's sort of, there is a real interesting thing here going on because he's male, and he's</p>
<p t="8298160" d="7000">he's all puffed up with his knowledge, which is completely shallow and, he is put in contact with this like celestial feminine ideal</p>
<p t="8305160" d="5520">and he just turns into a complete moron, and that's exactly what happens to men, it happens to them all the time</p>
<p t="8310680" d="5960">So, anyways, she decides to give him a chance and turns him into this conscience, and all of a sudden</p>
<p t="8316640" d="6380">he's this 1920's millionaire, so he's, he has been ennobled,  but then she tells him, that, you know</p>
<p t="8324020" d="7000">he has to journey along with Pinocchio in order for things to go properly, and he promises that he'll be a good conscience and do it</p>
<p t="8331020" d="2380">and he already thinks that he can do it,</p>
<p t="8333400" d="5340">and that's why he is on the matchbox, podium, you know, espousing his morality, but</p>
<p t="8338740" d="2220">the reality turns out to be much more complex</p>
<p t="8342020" d="800">So!</p>
<p t="8343600" d="5840">The bug has a little talk with the cricket [sic], the bug has a little talk with the puppet</p>
<p t="8350120" d="4480">the bug tries to tell Pinocchio explicitly what it means to be good.</p>
<p t="8354600" d="5080">And, he gets completely tangles up in the explanation because what the hell does he know</p>
<p t="8359680" d="6220">and the puppet doesn't understand anything says anyways, so there is message there, and the message is</p>
<p t="8366840" d="5600">the kind of knowledge that the conscience and the puppet are supposed to co-create,</p>
<p t="8372440" d="5040">is not something that you can articulate easily as a table of rules, it's not like that</p>
<p t="8377480" d="6760">because life is too complicated, to just have five rules that you live by and that will solve every problem</p>
<p t="8384240" d="4000">partly because the rules will conflict, that's a huge part of the problem, right</p>
<p t="8388240" d="5020">One moral guideline contradicts another in a situation, it's like you don't know what to do</p>
<p t="8393440" d="2400">So anyways they decide that they're...</p>
<p t="8396340" d="2560">They decide that they are just going to...</p>
<p t="8399320" d="7000">He says, Pinocchio says, ";Well, I will be a god boy."; and the cricket says, ";Well that's the spirit!";, and then, well then</p>
<p t="8406320" d="3620">Geppetto gets wind of it, and they have a little, like, horror episode</p>
<p t="8410340" d="3260">and then, he finds out that the puppet can...</p>
<p t="8413600" d="3320">he is autonomous and they have a little party, which tells you,</p>
<p t="8416920" d="4460">exactly what Geppetto is up to, is, the autonomy emerges and he is happy about it it</p>
<p t="8421380" d="6320">So it's stamping home the notion that Geppetto is, in fact, a good guy and that is, in fact, what he wants</p>
<p t="8427700" d="6400">So, it's like, the encouragement of your father is the precondition for the emergence of your individuality</p>
<p t="8434540" d="6140">And it also allows the feminine to play a role, both as Nature and perhaps as mother</p>
<p t="8440680" d="6480">and so, the combination of those two things produces the autonomous individual, it's like that seems perfectly reasonable</p>
<p t="8447520" d="3760">So, off they go to sleep, the next day they wake up</p>
<p t="8451800" d="5680">and it's a new day, and Pinocchio is off to school, and that's a good thing too, because</p>
<p t="8457480" d="4200">Geppetto isn't, and he is really excited about it, and so what that means is that</p>
<p t="8461680" d="6360">He's been parented properly, he is going to go out in the world of his peers, which is where he belongs</p>
<p t="8468040" d="4020">and Geppetto isn't to worried about it, in fact, he is pushing him out the door, you know</p>
<p t="8472220" d="3580">It's like, go, you can do it, this is the next thing!</p>
<p t="8475800" d="6840">The kid isn't cowering in the corner and cowering in terror, with the parents freaking out about all the things that are going to go wrong, it's...</p>
<p t="8483120" d="3180">There is some faith in his ability, so</p>
<p t="8486960" d="5920">he sees all the kids wandering by and Geppetto dresses him up, and sends him off to school.</p>
<p t="8493280" d="7000">And so, and so that's good, that's a happy family story, it's like, Mom and Dad got together, they decided that the</p>
<p t="8500960" d="5920">kid was going to, you know, be competent and autonomous and ready to face the world, and so</p>
<p t="8506880" d="4640">out he goes, and so he's like five years old at this point and that is where we get</p>
<p t="8511520" d="1320">that's were we are at</p>
<p t="8513540" d="880">in the story.</p>
<p t="8514620" d="5520">And I think that that is a good place to stop, because the next thing that happens is,</p>
<p t="8520200" d="3760">anomaly essentially, Pinocchio goes off to be a good boy</p>
<p t="8523960" d="4480">but it turns out that is a hell of a lot more complicated than he might think because</p>
<p t="8528560" d="4880">there are actually, complications in the world, but also malevolence</p>
<p t="8533620" d="6000">Right, the desire for things not to go right, there are people who are not oriented towards</p>
<p t="8539740" d="5900">the ideal, in any way at all, and Pinocchio is young and naive,</p>
<p t="8545920" d="5840">and so he has no defense what whatsoever against this malevolance, and that's, you know</p>
<p t="8555220" d="9300">That's not unexpected, and it also turns out that the conscience, the cricket, who is still not very clued in, oversleeps</p>
<p t="8564520" d="2220">And so he's just not there at a critical moment</p>
<p t="8567040" d="6520">But I think that we will pick that up next week, because this is a good point in the plot to stop</p>
<p t="8573620" d="4080">The child has entered the broader world and has to cope with it</p>
<p t="8577700" d="5200">And so, he's prepared because he had a wonderful father and he had a magical mother</p>
<p t="8582900" d="5020">and so he is prepared as you can be, he is even not completely a marionette anymore</p>
<p t="8588420" d="7000">but, now it's up to him, that's the thing, now it's up to him, his parents have done basically what they could</p>
<p t="8595560" d="2640">And that's really about right, you know</p>
<p t="8598600" d="2720">It's wise, I would say, psychologically</p>
<p t="8601660" d="4520">Alright, so, that's that!</p>
