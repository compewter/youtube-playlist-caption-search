<p t="499" d="2441">Hi, everyone.</p>
<p t="2940" d="2850">I'm going to talk to you
today about a book that I'm</p>
<p t="5790" d="5100">publishing in January of 2018.</p>
<p t="10890" d="4800">It's called 12 Rules for
Life: An Antidote to Chaos</p>
<p t="15690" d="3620">and it's going to be published
by Penguin Random House.</p>
<p t="19310" d="3330">I'm going to tell you how it
came about first and then I'll</p>
<p t="22640" d="2669">describe the book's
contents and then I'm going</p>
<p t="25309" d="1291">to read you a little bit of it.</p>
<p t="26600" d="900">OK.</p>
<p t="27500" d="6630">In 2012, I did a Canadian
Broadcasting Corporation</p>
<p t="34130" d="3570">program called Say
No to Happiness.</p>
<p t="37700" d="3500">And in that program,
I critiqued the idea</p>
<p t="41200" d="4410">that happiness was the proper
goal of life, claiming instead</p>
<p t="45610" d="4780">that it's much more useful
and effective perhaps</p>
<p t="50390" d="3960">even for producing happiness
to look for meaning</p>
<p t="54350" d="1770">and responsibility in life.</p>
<p t="56120" d="3000">Anyways, I received
the following email</p>
<p t="59120" d="2560">as a consequence.</p>
<p t="61680" d="4410">Dear Dr. Petersen, your
comments on the CBC program Say</p>
<p t="66090" d="2370">No to Happiness were both
thought-provoking and</p>
<p t="68460" d="1260">challenging.</p>
<p t="69720" d="1980">They had me asking
bigger questions</p>
<p t="71700" d="2640">and that is always
tremendously appealing.</p>
<p t="74340" d="2040">To be perfectly
honest, some aspects</p>
<p t="76380" d="2100">were harder for me to
understand than others,</p>
<p t="78480" d="2490">but I was left
wanting to know more.</p>
<p t="80970" d="2640">Have you considered writing
a book for a general,</p>
<p t="83610" d="2430">rather than academic, reader?</p>
<p t="86040" d="4050">I'm a literary agent and
co-owner at the Cook Agency.</p>
<p t="90090" d="1470">We have experience
with academics</p>
<p t="91560" d="2310">interested in writing
for a broad audience,</p>
<p t="93870" d="2610">working with them to remove the
scaffolding that is required</p>
<p t="96480" d="2340">in academic writing
and helping to make</p>
<p t="98820" d="1780">their work more accessible.</p>
<p t="100600" d="3140">We specialize in selling
authors to international markets</p>
<p t="103740" d="2250">and developing their
writing careers.</p>
<p t="105990" d="5370">You can find out more about
us at www.cookagency.ca.</p>
<p t="111360" d="2400">I look forward to
hearing from you.</p>
<p t="113760" d="2100">Sally Harding.</p>
<p t="115860" d="4260">So a literary agent
represents an author</p>
<p t="120120" d="2130">and attempts to
market their books.</p>
<p t="122250" d="3060">And so they can be
extraordinarily useful people.</p>
<p t="125310" d="2520">And in return for that,
they get a percentage</p>
<p t="127830" d="3179">of the book's profits and that's
how they make their living.</p>
<p t="131009" d="2621">So it's a difficult
job, especially now</p>
<p t="133630" d="3380">because the market for
books is very complicated</p>
<p t="137010" d="3600">and increasingly
restrictive, I would say,</p>
<p t="140610" d="2910">to a few extremely
successful authors.</p>
<p t="143520" d="5820">Anyways, Sally got a hold of me
and I'd thought for a long time</p>
<p t="149340" d="3750">about writing a more popular
version of my first book called</p>
<p t="153090" d="1770">Maps of Meaning.</p>
<p t="154860" d="3390">And I actually produced
almost a complete manuscript</p>
<p t="158250" d="5490">that was let's call it a
simplified version or--</p>
<p t="163740" d="2672">I wouldn't say simplified
exactly, more--</p>
<p t="166412" d="1708">well, I tried to make
it more accessible.</p>
<p t="168120" d="2400">But I was never
really happy with it.</p>
<p t="170520" d="4260">I never really felt that it
got its legs underneath it,</p>
<p t="174780" d="974">I suppose.</p>
<p t="175754" d="2166">And maybe that's because I
was duplicating something</p>
<p t="177920" d="1390">that I'd already done.</p>
<p t="179310" d="2760">I was thinking very hard
about what to do about this</p>
<p t="182070" d="2610">and how I might approach it
because Sally was interested</p>
<p t="184680" d="2610">and I thought it
might be a good thing</p>
<p t="187290" d="4940">to try to write a book for
a more general audience.</p>
<p t="192230" d="6230">And we talked for a while
and we discussed a few ideas.</p>
<p t="198460" d="2310">This was back in 2012.</p>
<p t="200770" d="3240">And I mentioned to her that
I had written something</p>
<p t="204010" d="5250">for Quora, which is
an online website,</p>
<p t="209260" d="3240">obviously, where
anybody can post</p>
<p t="212500" d="1950">any question and
anyone can answer it</p>
<p t="214450" d="2760">and then the questions
are voted on.</p>
<p t="217210" d="3000">And Quota's quite
interesting, I would say.</p>
<p t="220210" d="2070">And I had written a
variety of answers</p>
<p t="222280" d="2040">because I was playing
around with it.</p>
<p t="224320" d="3450">And some of them,
as it always is,</p>
<p t="227770" d="2850">attracted much more
attention than others.</p>
<p t="230620" d="3650">And somebody posted, I
think it was a young guy,</p>
<p t="234270" d="2710">posted this question, what
are the most valuable things</p>
<p t="236980" d="2040">everyone should know?</p>
<p t="239020" d="1700">And so I answered it.</p>
<p t="240720" d="4219">I listed, as it was,
42 rules to live by.</p>
<p t="244939" d="2041">And some of them were kind
of amusing, I thought,</p>
<p t="246980" d="2400">and some of them
were dead serious.</p>
<p t="249380" d="4250">Anyways, it became very
popular on Quora and as of now,</p>
<p t="253630" d="4680">it has 174,000
views and 2,500 up</p>
<p t="258310" d="4620">votes, which makes it one of
Quota's most popular answers,</p>
<p t="262930" d="2340">as it was soon
after I posted it.</p>
<p t="265270" d="3390">And I thought, well, people
really liked those rules,</p>
<p t="268660" d="2310">there was something about
them that appealed to them.</p>
<p t="270970" d="2730">So what if I write a
book based on the rules?</p>
<p t="273700" d="2230">And so I'll read you the rules.</p>
<p t="275930" d="590">OK.</p>
<p t="276520" d="3910">Maybe you'll find
them interesting.</p>
<p t="280430" d="2980">Tell the truth.</p>
<p t="283410" d="3840">Do not do things that
you hate, which I think</p>
<p t="287250" d="2040">is a variant of
telling the truth</p>
<p t="289290" d="3660">because you have to act out the
truth, as well as telling it.</p>
<p t="292950" d="2580">Act so that you can tell
the truth about how you act,</p>
<p t="295530" d="2190">that's obviously related
to the first two.</p>
<p t="297720" d="4140">Pursue what is meaningful,
not what is expedient.</p>
<p t="301860" d="1980">If you have to
choose, be the one</p>
<p t="303840" d="6100">who does things instead of the
one who is seen to do things.</p>
<p t="309940" d="1620">Pay attention.</p>
<p t="311560" d="2370">Assume that the person
you are listening to</p>
<p t="313930" d="3784">might know something
you need to know.</p>
<p t="317714" d="4006">Listen to them hard enough so
that they will share with you.</p>

to maintain the romance</p>
<p t="324330" d="2350">in your relationships.</p>

share good news with.</p>

share bad news with.</p>
<p t="334260" d="4930">Make at least one thing better
every single place you go.</p>

could be and then</p>
<p t="341140" d="2730">aim single-mindedly at that.</p>

become arrogant or resentful.</p>

house as beautiful as possible.</p>
<p t="352780" d="2550">Compare yourself to

else is today.</p>

can on at least one thing</p>

what you already know</p>

spite of your suffering.</p>
<p t="550160" d="5460">So those were the 40-odd rules,
and people were pretty happy</p>
<p t="555620" d="1330">with them.</p>
<p t="556950" d="1530">And then something odd happened.</p>
<p t="558480" d="3380">So a friend of mine is a
novelist, Greg Hurwitz.</p>
<p t="561860" d="4170">And Greg wrote a book
that's become very popular</p>
<p t="566030" d="2310">called Orphan X. And
one of the characters</p>
<p t="568340" d="3930">in that book, the female lead I
would say, an off and on again</p>
<p t="572270" d="3090">wrote romance interest
for the main character,</p>
<p t="575360" d="4350">posted these rules on her
fridge and so they were</p>
<p t="579710" d="1320">peppered throughout the book.</p>
<p t="581030" d="3490">So that was kind of an
interesting development,</p>
<p t="584520" d="980">I thought.</p>
<p t="585500" d="3320">And then because they
were so popular and Quora,</p>
<p t="588820" d="2010">I talked to Sally
about the possibility</p>
<p t="590830" d="1540">of turning them into a book.</p>
<p t="592370" d="4610">And so my original vision
was to write 42 short essays.</p>
<p t="596980" d="1866">I thought that would be--</p>
<p t="598846" d="1814">and I was going to
call the book 42,</p>
<p t="600660" d="3180">which I thought was quite
funny because if you remember,</p>
<p t="603840" d="2430">the answer to life, the
universe, and everything</p>
<p t="606270" d="3140">from Douglas Adams was 42.</p>
<p t="609410" d="1400">A computer calculated that.</p>
<p t="610810" d="2510">So I thought it would be
amusing to write a book called</p>
<p t="613320" d="3280">42 that contained
answers to life,</p>
<p t="616600" d="1400">the universe, and everything.</p>
<p t="618000" d="2460">But when I started
writing the book,</p>
<p t="620460" d="3900">it turned out that I had more
to say about each of the rules</p>
<p t="624360" d="3170">than I had originally
envisioned.</p>
<p t="627530" d="4140">And so I first cut it down
to 25 and wrote some essays,</p>
<p t="631670" d="1620">and then I cut it down to 16.</p>
<p t="633290" d="2820">And it was still
too long, and then I</p>
<p t="636110" d="1620">cut it down to 12,
which turned out</p>
<p t="637730" d="2460">to be a good thing anyways
because if you write a book,</p>
<p t="640190" d="2550">you should write way more
than you're going to publish</p>
<p t="642740" d="1230">and then cut.</p>
<p t="643970" d="3940">Because that way, you're
only left with what's best.</p>
<p t="647910" d="5204">So anyways, I wrote
for about three years--</p>
<p t="653114" d="1416">well, no, it's
more than that now.</p>
<p t="654530" d="2640">I guess it's almost five
years because I just</p>
<p t="657170" d="2810">finished the book in September.</p>
<p t="659980" d="2140">So it took about four
or five years to write,</p>
<p t="662120" d="1980">and I was writing
pretty regularly.</p>
<p t="664100" d="3300">What I'm going to do is read
to you a little bit of it,</p>
<p t="667400" d="1080">I think.</p>
<p t="668480" d="2940">This is the book here.</p>
<p t="671420" d="2850">That's a galley copy,
and a galley copy</p>
<p t="674270" d="2580">is a preprint of
a book so that you</p>
<p t="676850" d="2670">can get some sense of
what it looks like.</p>
<p t="679520" d="2730">It's got some nice
illustrations in it, I think,</p>
<p t="682250" d="5220">by this comic book author
named Ethan van Sciver.</p>
<p t="687470" d="4350">So that's kind of a rough
one on chapter three,</p>
<p t="691820" d="3750">";Treat Yourself Like Someone You
are Responsible for Helping.";</p>
<p t="695570" d="4740">Ethan is a comic book artist,
he's a great Illustrator.</p>
<p t="700310" d="4470">And he put each one of my kids,
I have two kids, one of them</p>
<p t="704780" d="5730">in each illustration
sort of contemplating</p>
<p t="710510" d="1650">the complexities
of life, I guess</p>
<p t="712160" d="1650">that's how you
might subscribe it.</p>
<p t="713810" d="1197">So that's one illustration.</p>
<p t="715007" d="1083">I'll show you another one.</p>
<p t="718610" d="2180">So that's my son,
Julian, there looking up</p>
<p t="720790" d="2220">at the great statue of David.</p>
<p t="723010" d="3690">And David, of course, is
an inspirational statue.</p>
<p t="726700" d="2400">It's a representation
of what you could be.</p>
<p t="729100" d="2190">And that's rule
three, make friends</p>
<p t="731290" d="1970">with people who want
the best for you.</p>
<p t="733260" d="4940">And I think I'm going to read
some of that to you right now.</p>
<p t="738200" d="2870">Each rule is divided
into subsections--</p>
<p t="741070" d="4160">small subchapters, let's say--
and I'll read you one of those</p>
<p t="745230" d="2290">so you'll get some
sense of the book.</p>
<p t="747520" d="3630">Rule three, make
friends with people</p>
<p t="751150" d="3470">who want the best for you.</p>
<p t="754620" d="2510">The old hometown.</p>
<p t="757130" d="1720">The town I grew up
in had been scraped</p>
<p t="758850" d="4920">only 50 years earlier out of the
endless flat northern prairie.</p>
<p t="763770" d="3060">Fairview, Alberta was
part of the frontier</p>
<p t="766830" d="2820">and had the cowboy
bars to prove it.</p>
<p t="769650" d="3600">The Hudson's Bay Company
department store on Main Street</p>
<p t="773250" d="2490">still bought beaver,
wolf, and coyote furs</p>
<p t="775740" d="2430">directly from the
local trappers.</p>
<p t="778170" d="4170">3,000 people lived there, 400
miles away from the nearest</p>
<p t="782340" d="1720">city.</p>
<p t="784060" d="5640">Cable TV, video games, and
internet did not exist.</p>
<p t="789700" d="2430">It was no easy matter to
stay innocently amused</p>
<p t="792130" d="3890">in Fairview, particularly
during the five months of winter</p>
<p t="796020" d="3990">when long stretches of 40 below
days and even colder nights</p>
<p t="800010" d="2340">were the norm.</p>
<p t="802350" d="3590">The world's a different place
when it's cold like that.</p>
<p t="805940" d="3640">The drunks in our town
ended their sad lives early.</p>
<p t="809580" d="2910">They passed out in snow
banks at 3:00 in the morning,</p>
<p t="812490" d="1770">froze to death.</p>
<p t="814260" d="3920">You don't go outside
casually when it's 40 below.</p>
<p t="818180" d="5450">On first breath, the arid desert
air constricts your lungs.</p>
<p t="823630" d="3840">Ice forms on your eyelashes
and they stick together.</p>
<p t="827470" d="4080">Long hair wet from the shower
freezes solid and then stands</p>
<p t="831550" d="4470">on end, wraith-like of its own
accord later in a warm house</p>
<p t="836020" d="4440">when it thaws bone dry,
charged with electricity.</p>
<p t="840460" d="3730">Children only put their tongues
on steel playground equipment</p>
<p t="844190" d="2130">once.</p>
<p t="846320" d="3060">Smoke from house
chimneys doesn't rise.</p>
<p t="849380" d="3120">Defeated by the cold,
it drifts downwards</p>
<p t="852500" d="3450">and collects like fog
on snow-covered rooftops</p>
<p t="855950" d="1650">and yards.</p>
<p t="857600" d="2100">Cars must be
plugged in at night,</p>
<p t="859700" d="3270">their engines warmed
by block heaters or oil</p>
<p t="862970" d="2130">will not flow through
them in the morning</p>
<p t="865100" d="2910">and they won't start.</p>
<p t="868010" d="2160">Sometimes they won't anyways.</p>
<p t="870170" d="1890">Then you turn the
engine over pointlessly</p>
<p t="872060" d="3540">until the starter
clatters and falls silent.</p>
<p t="875600" d="2970">Then you remove the frozen
battery from the car,</p>
<p t="878570" d="3630">loosening bolts with stiffening
figures in the intense cold,</p>
<p t="882200" d="2450">and bring it into the house.</p>
<p t="884650" d="3360">It sits there sweating
for hours until it warms</p>
<p t="888010" d="3120">enough to hold a decent charge.</p>
<p t="891130" d="2580">You're not going to see out of
the back window of your car,</p>
<p t="893710" d="805">either.</p>
<p t="894515" d="3905">It frosts over in November
and stays that way until May.</p>
<p t="898420" d="3600">Scraping it off just
dampens the upholstery,</p>
<p t="902020" d="3190">then that freezes, too.</p>
<p t="905210" d="2280">Late one night going
to visit a friend,</p>
<p t="907490" d="3090">I sat for two hours on the
edge of the passenger's seat</p>
<p t="910580" d="3390">in a 1970 Dodge
Challenger jammed up</p>
<p t="913970" d="4320">against the stick shift using
a vodka-soaked rag to keep</p>
<p t="918290" d="1590">the inside of the
front windshield</p>
<p t="919880" d="3480">clear in front of the driver
because the car heater had</p>
<p t="923360" d="1050">quit.</p>
<p t="924410" d="2520">Stopping wasn't an option.</p>
<p t="926930" d="2280">There was nowhere to stop.</p>
<p t="929210" d="2110">And it was hell on house cats.</p>
<p t="931320" d="3110">Felines in Fairview had
short ears and tails</p>
<p t="934430" d="3680">because they had lost the
tips of both to frostbite.</p>
<p t="938110" d="2550">They came to resemble
arctic foxes, which</p>
<p t="940660" d="4080">evolved those features
to deal proactively</p>
<p t="944740" d="2250">with the intense cold.</p>
<p t="946990" d="2790">One day our cat got
outside and no one noticed.</p>
<p t="949780" d="2820">We found him later,
fur frozen fast</p>
<p t="952600" d="4650">to the cold, hard concrete,
with no lasting damage</p>
<p t="957250" d="1830">except to his pride.</p>
<p t="959080" d="4500">Fairview cats were also at great
risk in the winter from cars,</p>
<p t="963580" d="2760">but not for the
reasons you think.</p>
<p t="966340" d="2400">It wasn't automobiles
sliding on icy roads</p>
<p t="968740" d="1080">and running them over.</p>
<p t="969820" d="3240">Only loser cats died that way.</p>
<p t="973060" d="2730">It was cars parked
immediately after being driven</p>
<p t="975790" d="1440">that were dangerous.</p>
<p t="977230" d="2730">A frigid cat might think
highly of climbing up</p>
<p t="979960" d="5760">under such a vehicle and sitting
on its still warm engine block.</p>
<p t="985720" d="2810">But what if the driver
decided to use the car again</p>
<p t="988530" d="4150">before the engine cooled
down and the cat departed?</p>
<p t="992680" d="2130">Let's just say that
heat-seeking house</p>
<p t="994810" d="3270">pets and rapidly
rotating radiator fans</p>
<p t="998080" d="3620">do not co-exist happily.</p>
<p t="1001700" d="3570">Because we were so far north,
the bitterly cold winters</p>
<p t="1005270" d="1860">were very dark.</p>
<p t="1007130" d="3990">By December, the sun
didn't rise until 10:00 AM.</p>
<p t="1011120" d="2970">We trudged to school
in the pitch black.</p>
<p t="1014090" d="2010">It wasn't much lighter
when we walked home just</p>
<p t="1016100" d="2124">before the early sunset.</p>
<p t="1018224" d="1416">There wasn't much
for young people</p>
<p t="1019640" d="2880">to do in Fairview,
even in the summer,</p>
<p t="1022520" d="1849">but the winters were worse.</p>
<p t="1024369" d="5361">Then your friends mattered
more than anything.</p>
<p t="1029730" d="2690">So that's a little section
of 12 Rules for Life.</p>
<p t="1032420" d="2189">I can tell you
what the rules are.</p>
<p t="1034609" d="2581">It's foreword was
written by Norman Doidge.</p>
<p t="1037190" d="3427">He comments a little bit
about the political turmoil</p>
<p t="1040617" d="1583">that surrounded me
over the last year,</p>
<p t="1042200" d="4230">although the book itself is very
apolitical with the exception</p>
<p t="1046430" d="3360">of the chapter on
skateboarding, where</p>
<p t="1049790" d="4830">I go into the ongoing,
polarizing battle between I</p>
<p t="1054620" d="2730">would say the radical
left and everyone else.</p>
<p t="1057350" d="4350">But other than that, it's
not a political book.</p>
<p t="1061700" d="3000">So the table of
contents includes</p>
<p t="1064700" d="3660">rule one, stand up straight
with your shoulders back.</p>
<p t="1068360" d="2640">That's actually a
story that centers</p>
<p t="1071000" d="2640">on lobsters to a large degree.</p>
<p t="1073640" d="4980">I have a proclivity for
talking about lobsters.</p>
<p t="1078620" d="3160">Rule two, treat yourself
like someone you</p>
<p t="1081780" d="1664">are responsible for helping.</p>
<p t="1083444" d="1416">That's something
that people don't</p>
<p t="1084860" d="3060">do very well because they're
not very happy with themselves</p>
<p t="1087920" d="1320">often.</p>
<p t="1089240" d="2640">Rule three, make
friends with people</p>
<p t="1091880" d="1560">who want the best for you.</p>
<p t="1093440" d="2400">That's the chapter
I already read.</p>
<p t="1095840" d="1170">I read the first part of it.</p>
<p t="1097010" d="4620">And it's about trying
to organize your life</p>
<p t="1101630" d="1620">so that you're
surrounded by people</p>
<p t="1103250" d="4110">who support you when you're
trying to do what's right.</p>
<p t="1107360" d="2360">It's very important.</p>
<p t="1109720" d="3150">Rule four, compare yourself
to who you were yesterday</p>
<p t="1112870" d="3780">and not to who
someone else is today.</p>
<p t="1116650" d="2850">Because if you're comparing
yourself to someone else,</p>
<p t="1119500" d="1980">I mean, first of all,
you don't know very much</p>
<p t="1121480" d="3060">about the life of the person
you are comparing yourself to;</p>
<p t="1124540" d="3480">you don't know it across
all of its dimensions.</p>
<p t="1128020" d="1990">And second, people
are very different</p>
<p t="1130010" d="2850">and so comparing
yourself to someone else</p>
<p t="1132860" d="2270">is kind of useful, I
guess, when you're young.</p>
<p t="1135130" d="2880">But as you get older and more
singular and more particular,</p>
<p t="1138010" d="3660">it becomes increasingly
less useful.</p>
<p t="1141670" d="3030">Better to compare yourself to
a previous version of yourself</p>
<p t="1144700" d="3450">and work for
improvement in that way.</p>
<p t="1148150" d="3134">Rule five, do not
let your children</p>
<p t="1151284" d="1666">do anything that makes
you dislike them.</p>
<p t="1152950" d="2920">That's probably going to be
the most controversial chapter,</p>
<p t="1155870" d="500">I would say.</p>
<p t="1156370" d="6940">It's a chapter about discipline
and love and respect.</p>
<p t="1163310" d="2740">I guess that's probably right.</p>
<p t="1166050" d="2640">Rule six, set your
house in perfect order</p>
<p t="1168690" d="1901">before you criticize the world.</p>
<p t="1170591" d="499">Yeah.</p>
<p t="1171090" d="4070">Well, that's a
rough chapter, man.</p>
<p t="1175160" d="1840">I'm trying to
explain the mindset</p>
<p t="1177000" d="3610">behind people like the
Columbine High School shooters.</p>
<p t="1180610" d="4160">And so it's a harsh chapter.</p>
<p t="1184770" d="2550">Rule seven, pursue
what is meaningful</p>
<p t="1187320" d="2520">and not what is expedient.</p>
<p t="1189840" d="2780">Expedient is what works
in the short term,</p>
<p t="1192620" d="2230">expedient is what's easy.</p>
<p t="1194850" d="4050">Meaningful, instead, is what
sustains you through tragedy,</p>
<p t="1198900" d="1580">let's say.</p>
<p t="1200480" d="4540">Rule eight, tell the truth,
or at least don't lie.</p>
<p t="1205020" d="500">Yeah.</p>
<p t="1205520" d="2400">Well, it's not that easy to
tell the truth because who</p>
<p t="1207920" d="1140">knows about the truth?</p>
<p t="1209060" d="2640">But you can learn
not to say things</p>
<p t="1211700" d="1390">that you know to be false.</p>
<p t="1213090" d="3170">And if you stop saying things
that you know to be false,</p>
<p t="1216260" d="1830">then your life
will improve a lot.</p>
<p t="1218090" d="3990">It simplifies it and it puts
you in alignment with reality.</p>
<p t="1222080" d="2220">And you should be in
alignment with reality</p>
<p t="1224300" d="3540">because there's a lot more
of it than there is of you.</p>
<p t="1227840" d="3030">Rule nine, assume that the
person you're listening</p>
<p t="1230870" d="2820">to might know
something you don't.</p>
<p t="1233690" d="3300">That's a good one because--
and this is even true when</p>
<p t="1236990" d="3720">you're dealing with people that
don't like you because they may</p>
<p t="1240710" d="2850">offer you criticisms
that are valid--</p>
<p t="1243560" d="2640">many that aren't, too, of course
because maybe they're just</p>
<p t="1246200" d="1740">trying to take you down a bit.</p>
<p t="1247940" d="2610">But if you get a
criticism that's valid</p>
<p t="1250550" d="3810">and then you can fix
that error, let's say,</p>
<p t="1254360" d="2910">that'll stop you from running
nose first into walls,</p>
<p t="1257270" d="2220">and that's generally
a handy thing.</p>
<p t="1259490" d="3731">Rule 10, be precise
in your speech.</p>
<p t="1263221" d="499">Yeah.</p>
<p t="1263720" d="2820">Well, you have to be
exacting in the way</p>
<p t="1266540" d="1980">that you subscribe
things and the way</p>
<p t="1268520" d="2370">that you think because
otherwise, you live in the fog</p>
<p t="1270890" d="3120">and you won't get what
you should out of life</p>
<p t="1274010" d="2410">or what you need out of life.</p>
<p t="1276420" d="3110">And by need, I mean what will
sustain you so that you don't</p>
<p t="1279530" d="3190">become bitter and resentful.</p>
<p t="1282720" d="4410">Rule 11, do not bother children
when they're skateboarding.</p>
<p t="1287130" d="5400">So that chapter is about I would
say our society's hyper concern</p>
<p t="1292530" d="3000">with safety and its
fundamental antagonism</p>
<p t="1295530" d="4610">to exploratory behavior,
especially among boys.</p>
<p t="1300140" d="4150">Rule 12, pet a cat when you
encounter one on the street.</p>
<p t="1304290" d="500">Yeah.</p>
<p t="1304790" d="6600">Well, that's about trying to
orient yourself towards life so</p>
<p t="1311390" d="2730">that even when you're in
the middle of a crisis</p>
<p t="1314120" d="5710">or a tragedy, you can find bits
and pieces of experience that</p>
<p t="1319830" d="6510">are positive and sustaining so
that you can stay positively</p>
<p t="1326340" d="3180">oriented towards your own
existence and towards existence</p>
<p t="1329520" d="1780">itself.</p>
<p t="1331300" d="4710">So anyways, that's the book.</p>
<p t="1336010" d="3870">And it's coming
out January 23rd,</p>
<p t="1339880" d="2790">although it's
available for preorder</p>
<p t="1342670" d="4530">at Amazon.com or Amazon.ca
and several other places.</p>
<p t="1347200" d="4080">I'll put links in the
video description.</p>
<p t="1351280" d="3510">If you're trying to figure
out how to orient yourself</p>
<p t="1354790" d="3180">in the midst of the chaos
that constitutes life,</p>
<p t="1357970" d="4080">then you might find some of the
things that I wrote in 12 Rules</p>
<p t="1362050" d="1440">for Life Helpful.</p>
<p t="1363490" d="4920">So I hope that that was
interesting and goodbye</p>
<p t="1368410" d="1730">for now.</p>
