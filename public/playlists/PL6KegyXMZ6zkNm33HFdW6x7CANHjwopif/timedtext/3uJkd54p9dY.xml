<p t="880" d="1440">Alright.</p>
<p t="2320" d="2880">Welcome back.</p>
<p t="5200" d="13200">So, the next four lectures are also oriented
towards discussion of primarily clinical theories</p>
<p t="18400" d="5589">of psychology and psychopathology.</p>
<p t="23989" d="8401">We're going to talk about lines of thinking
that, in some ways, run parallel to those</p>
<p t="32390" d="6150">of the psychoanalysts because the thinkers
we're going to discuss now, with a few small</p>
<p t="38540" d="3530">exceptions—well, all of them—all of the
thinkers we're going to discuss in the next</p>
<p t="42070" d="8410">four lectures were either influenced heavily
by Freud, Jung, and Adler or were themselves</p>
<p t="50480" d="3130">thinkers who influenced Freud and Jung.</p>
<p t="53610" d="9379">So, there's an intellectual continuity stretching
over—with people who are deeply educated</p>
<p t="62989" d="5111">and who very thoughtful there's intellectually
continuity of ideas stretching over exceptional</p>
<p t="68100" d="1909">spans of time.</p>
<p t="70009" d="6900">And so that sort of relationship is exactly
what you would imagine.</p>
<p t="76909" d="5691">Rogers had a variety of influences—so let's
say Freud and Jung and Adler—but he was</p>
<p t="82600" d="4199">also very much influenced by phenomenological
ideas.</p>
<p t="86799" d="11221">And the phenomenologists were, and are—phenomenology
is a brand of philosophy, which I'll explain</p>
<p t="98020" d="6500">more deeply, and the other primary domain
of influence on Rogers was Christianity likely</p>
<p t="104520" d="6869">and then Christianity also via probably Northern
European culture as far as I can tell.</p>
<p t="111389" d="4421">The reason I'm talking specifically about
Christianity in relationship to Rogers is</p>
<p t="115810" d="5250">because as a young man he was a fundamentalist
Christian and he was a seminarian.</p>
<p t="121060" d="7199">So he was quite oriented towards mainline
Protestant Christianity, but when he was in</p>
<p t="128259" d="4401">university he had a crisis of belief I suppose.</p>
<p t="132660" d="3550">He was even going to go to China as a missionary
at one point.</p>
<p t="136210" d="5410">But he had a crisis of belief in university
because he had also been scientifically trained.</p>
<p t="141620" d="6660">His father was a farmer who used rather advanced
farming techniques, and so Rogers was trained</p>
<p t="148280" d="2200">to think scientifically from a very young
age.</p>
<p t="150480" d="4600">And he experienced the conflict between his
religious belief and his scientific presuppositions</p>
<p t="155080" d="8030">quite intensely, and in that battle his formal
Christian belief was the loser.</p>
<p t="163110" d="6500">However, his thinking is very much influenced
by fundamentalist Protestant presuppositions</p>
<p t="169610" d="9840">and the effect of those I'll describe as
we walk through Rogers' thinking.</p>
<p t="179450" d="8910">Now, it's important to understand the philosophical
underpinnings of a global personality or psychology</p>
<p t="188360" d="11410">theory because every theory is set within
a set of assumptions—things that you have</p>
<p t="199770" d="3020">to assume to be true in order to proceed with
a theory.</p>
<p t="202790" d="4240">They're like the axioms in classical geometry.</p>
<p t="207030" d="2320">You can't prove the axioms; you have to
accept them.</p>
<p t="209350" d="3700">Once you accept the axioms then you can move
forward and use the whole system.</p>
<p t="213050" d="6360">I think the reason that systems have to have
axioms, which are elements of belief, is because</p>
<p t="219410" d="1720">every system is incomplete, right?</p>
<p t="221130" d="3220">It doesn't cover the entire world.</p>
<p t="224350" d="5580">And so, in some sense, you need a place to
dispense with your ignorance and the way you</p>
<p t="229930" d="1670">do that is by making assumptions.</p>
<p t="231600" d="4500">We're going to act as if the following is
true.</p>
<p t="236100" d="3930">And then you can proceed with a partial theory
and you'll have some success with it.</p>
<p t="240030" d="6220">But it's useful to understand the presuppositions
because it orients you properly towards the</p>
<p t="246250" d="1000">theory.</p>
<p t="247250" d="6900">Now Rogers is a phenomenologist, and phenomenology
is a brand of philosophy, which I believe</p>
<p t="254150" d="8690">started with Edmund Husserl but was probably
made most influential by his student Martin</p>
<p t="262840" d="1500">Heidegger.</p>
<p t="264340" d="10150">Now Heidegger was a philosopher I suppose
somewhat like Nietzsche in that his thinking</p>
<p t="274490" d="5950">ran very much counter to what you might describe
as general academic philosophy.</p>
<p t="280440" d="6590">For example, Heidegger believed that ever
since the time of Plato, which is when people</p>
<p t="287030" d="7430">think philosophy began more or less, Western
philosophy had taken an erroneous direction:</p>
<p t="294460" d="6150">it had become too concerned with the nature
of structures of thought and not concerned</p>
<p t="300610" d="2920">enough about the nature of being.</p>
<p t="303530" d="2040">And so you can determine those two things.</p>
<p t="305570" d="4520">Being is how things are and thought, of course,
is how you represent things.</p>
<p t="310090" d="12130">And one of Heidegger's missions was to reestablish
being as the central reality of philosophy.</p>
<p t="322220" d="6660">Now that begs a question, which is: “What
is being?”</p>
<p t="328880" d="7320">Well, to conceptualize reality as being is
not to conceptualize it the same way that</p>
<p t="336200" d="11420">you conceptualize it in terms of modern Western
thought, because one of the presuppositions</p>
<p t="347620" d="6840">at the basis of modern Western thought is
that the most intelligent way to divide up</p>
<p t="354460" d="8110">the world is in terms of subjective and objective
experience or subjective experience and objective</p>
<p t="362570" d="1000">world.</p>
<p t="363570" d="6690">So the fundamental scientific presupposition,
you might say, is that there is an objective</p>
<p t="370260" d="2900">world; it's the real thing.</p>
<p t="373160" d="5770">You come to that by performing certain procedures,
documenting them, describing the outcome of</p>
<p t="378930" d="5250">those procedures, documenting them, and then
allowing other people to do the same thing</p>
<p t="384180" d="5239">operating under the presupposition that if
they experience the same outcome from the</p>
<p t="389419" d="2251">procedures, then what they're experiencing
is real.</p>
<p t="391670" d="2469">That's basically the scientific method,
right?</p>
<p t="394139" d="1000">Method.</p>
<p t="395139" d="1000">Results.</p>
<p t="396139" d="2571">You detail the method, which is how you act
on the world; you get the results.</p>
<p t="398710" d="5470">You compare them, maybe across multiple observations
that you do; and then other people do multiple</p>
<p t="404180" d="5170">observations; you come up with a consensus,
but it's a method bound consensus.</p>
<p t="409350" d="4300">And then of course you abstract out general
principles from that and it works very powerfully,</p>
<p t="413650" d="1000">right?</p>
<p t="414650" d="2350">Make no mistake about it.</p>
<p t="417000" d="4840">The idea that there is an objective external
world and that that's the best way to conceptualize</p>
<p t="421840" d="4420">reality is an unbelievably powerful tool.</p>
<p t="426260" d="6510">Now, whether or not it's an accurate description
of reality: that's a much more difficult</p>
<p t="432770" d="1100">question.</p>
<p t="433870" d="4590">And it's partly a matter of definition,
actually.</p>
<p t="438460" d="4020">You know, it's the case there are different
forms of geometry; you might know this.</p>
<p t="442480" d="5140">You can start from the presupposition that
reality has a three-dimensional structure—and</p>
<p t="447620" d="4820">then you're basically within the realm of
Euclidean geometry—but you can also start</p>
<p t="452440" d="2970">with the presupposition that reality has a
four-dimensional structure.</p>
<p t="455410" d="4470">And that kind of geometry was invented in
the late 1800's and it turned out to be</p>
<p t="459880" d="3759">the perfect geometry to describe the universe
that Einstein conceptualized when he came</p>
<p t="463639" d="6021">up with his great theories in the second decade,
thereabouts, of the twentieth century.</p>
<p t="469660" d="4860">So it's interesting because can start from
different assumptions, build tools on the</p>
<p t="474520" d="3560">basis of those assumptions, and sometimes
you find out that those tools work very well</p>
<p t="478080" d="1490">indeed.</p>
<p t="479570" d="10980">Now, it's not that easy to think of flaws
in the subjective experience/ objective world</p>
<p t="490550" d="5560">conceptualization, and that's partly—for
us as modern people it forms the basis of</p>
<p t="496110" d="3440">so much of what we think that we just think
about it as axiomatic.</p>
<p t="499550" d="1300">It's just true.</p>
<p t="500850" d="1980">It doesn't bear any question.</p>
<p t="502830" d="6149">But I'm going to offer you a couple examples
of why it might bear some questioning and</p>
<p t="508979" d="4170">you can think about it.</p>
<p t="513149" d="6291">The first problem is is that the classical
scientific view of the world has a very difficult</p>
<p t="519440" d="1670">time accounting for certain things.</p>
<p t="521110" d="7419">So, for example—these are called “qualia”
often by people who are interested in consciousness—knowing</p>
<p t="528529" d="3711">the wavelength of light doesn't seem to
tell you very much about the subjective experience</p>
<p t="532240" d="1560">of color.</p>
<p t="533800" d="4820">You know, we experience color, for example,
in a non-continuous fashion, right, because</p>
<p t="538620" d="2480">we see discrete colors like you'd see in
a rainbow.</p>
<p t="541100" d="3590">I mean they shade into each other to some
degree but it's not like they go from light</p>
<p t="544690" d="1820">red to dark red in a continuum.</p>
<p t="546510" d="2440">There are clear demarcations of color.</p>
<p t="548950" d="4000">Well, that's because of the way your brain
is wired.</p>
<p t="552950" d="4810">You know, it seems like, over the course of
evolution, what we've learned is that parsing</p>
<p t="557760" d="4230">up that wavelength fragment in terms of categories,
which would be the different colors that we</p>
<p t="561990" d="3000">see, has substantial practical utility.</p>
<p t="564990" d="4150">Now one of the things you might ask is, “Well,
do those colors exist?”</p>
<p t="569140" d="6350">Well, objectively they don't seem to exist
as colors, partly because the wavelengths</p>
<p t="575490" d="1740">that we see are actually continuous.</p>
<p t="577230" d="6400">So when one color shades into another, there's
no radical transformation in wavelength.</p>
<p t="583630" d="2260">It's a continuum but we see it categorically.</p>
<p t="585890" d="1259">Okay, so is that real or not.</p>
<p t="587149" d="2281">Are the colors we see real or not?</p>
<p t="589430" d="4080">Well, that's a good question.</p>
<p t="593510" d="3860">You can't get a collective experience of
pain.</p>
<p t="597370" d="4250">You can get a collective experience of the
blackboard, but pain seems to be something</p>
<p t="601620" d="2800">that's limited to subjective perception.</p>
<p t="604420" d="5310">But it's very difficult—no one acts as
if pain isn't real.</p>
<p t="609730" d="7260">I mean I would say that of all the things
that you might consider real we act as if</p>
<p t="616990" d="1830">pain is the most real thing.</p>
<p t="618820" d="3300">You certainly can't argue out of it for
example.</p>
<p t="622120" d="2740">It seems like a fundamental element of experience.</p>
<p t="624860" d="2480">Okay, so that's two places.</p>
<p t="627340" d="8740">We also have no account in the subjective/
objective breakup bifurcation of the world—we</p>
<p t="636080" d="2480">have no explanation whatsoever for consciousness.</p>
<p t="638560" d="6370">And that seems like a big problem, right,
because you can make a case that there is</p>
<p t="644930" d="1680">no being without consciousness.</p>
<p t="646610" d="3010">Like, “Is there something if there's no
one there to perceive it?”</p>
<p t="649620" d="4120">By the way, that is not the same question
as, “If a tree falls in the forest and there's</p>
<p t="653740" d="1730">no one there to hear it, does it make a sound?”</p>
<p t="655470" d="1550">It's not the same question.</p>
<p t="657020" d="4319">It sounds superficially the same, but this
is a much more complex question because we</p>
<p t="661339" d="6560">don't know, for example, if—we don't
know the relationship between time and consciousness.</p>
<p t="667899" d="2901">We have a certain perception of time.</p>
<p t="670800" d="3490">We have a certain temporal realm in which
we exist.</p>
<p t="674290" d="4500">Our refresh rate for our vision, for example,
is about sixty hertz, which is why you can</p>
<p t="678790" d="3830">see computer screens flicker if they have
a refresh rate slower than that.</p>
<p t="682620" d="5980">So sixty hertz to us looks continuous but,
you know, there are a lot of microseconds</p>
<p t="688600" d="4660">in a second and for a computer—especially
a fast-processing computer that can do maybe</p>
<p t="693260" d="5980">a trillion operations a second—if it was
watching, so to speak, a movie it would just</p>
<p t="699240" d="5340">see a still picture that was there forever
and a another still picture that was there</p>
<p t="704580" d="1000">forever.</p>
<p t="705580" d="3190">And it wouldn't have the impression of continuous
movement.</p>
<p t="708770" d="4920">So there's this weird subjective element
to time that's very difficult to understand.</p>
<p t="713690" d="5800">And then here's a more complex criticism
of the subject/ object idea.</p>
<p t="719490" d="2380">I thought about this for a long time.</p>
<p t="721870" d="8260">So, the best example I know of it is: I read
this book a while back written by a KGB officer</p>
<p t="730130" d="4320">and it was published after the fall of the,
you know, wall in the Soviet Empire.</p>
<p t="734450" d="5389">And this KGB officer claimed that he had worked
in a biological warfare unit in the Soviet</p>
<p t="739839" d="6151">Union, and the purpose of the biological warfare
unit was to turn infectious diseases into</p>
<p t="745990" d="4340">aerosols so that they could be sprayed on
enemy populations.</p>
<p t="750330" d="5060">And so they were working on two things: developing
a very virulent infections—and a virulent</p>
<p t="755390" d="5340">infection is one that's severe but also
very transmissible, because those things are</p>
<p t="760730" d="4270">separate—and also one that could survive
being aerosolized because it turns out that</p>
<p t="765000" d="3250">that's quite difficult, which we should
be all be very thankful about.</p>
<p t="768250" d="5950">And one of the products they were working
on was an attempt to cross Ebola with smallpox.</p>
<p t="774200" d="7460">Now Ebola is—you all know about Ebola I
presume—it's very very fatal, although</p>
<p t="781660" d="3570">they've learned ways to treat it now and
maybe have a vaccine.</p>
<p t="785230" d="2690">But at that time it was very very fatal.</p>
<p t="787920" d="4650">And smallpox is incredibly contagious, and
so they were hoping they could develop something</p>
<p t="792570" d="8220">that was very very contagious and very very
deadly that you could spray on civilian populations.</p>
<p t="800790" d="8479">Now, you know, here's where it gets tricky,
and it gets tricky here because how you answer</p>
<p t="809269" d="6311">this question inevitably depends on how you
define truth.</p>
<p t="815580" d="3290">And truth is actually something you have to
define before you can have a conversation</p>
<p t="818870" d="6490">about it, which is a kind of a strange thing.</p>
<p t="825360" d="7490">Anyways, you can make a case that determining
how to cross Ebola with smallpox and aerosolize</p>
<p t="832850" d="9520">it is a perfectly valid scientific question,
and because science is value free it's very</p>
<p t="842370" d="3000">difficult to make an argument that that's
any worse experiment than any other kind of</p>
<p t="845370" d="2909">experiment or any other kind of investigation.</p>
<p t="848279" d="5481">And you can also imagine even that if didn't
go to the aerosolization stage that positive</p>
<p t="853760" d="1199">things might come out of it.</p>
<p t="854959" d="4690">Maybe you'd end up with a more detailed
understanding of DNA or something as a consequence</p>
<p t="859649" d="3190">of the investigation that would have positive
consequences.</p>
<p t="862839" d="10921">But it still seems that—the idea of doing
scientific research to cross Ebola with smallpox—there</p>
<p t="873760" d="7800">seems to be something wrong with that, and
it's maybe that sense of wrongness as well</p>
<p t="881560" d="4089">that can't be captured within scientific
models.</p>
<p t="885649" d="7031">And so one of the things that Jung claimed—and
Rogers and the phenomenologists—is that,</p>
<p t="892680" d="7490">in some sense, is that the scientific reality
has to be encapsulated within an ethical reality</p>
<p t="900170" d="3010">rather than the other way around.</p>
<p t="903180" d="3400">Now Rogers would say, “You know that feeling
that you have when you hear about someone</p>
<p t="906580" d="4780">crossing Ebola with smallpox; that feeling
you have in your body.</p>
<p t="911360" d="6800">That's a real thing, that feeling, and that's
part of being.”</p>
<p t="918160" d="10590">Now, for the phenomenologists, being is actually—it's
complicated to define and it's hard to understand.</p>
<p t="928750" d="3389">But what the phenomenologists do is start
with a different set of assumptions.</p>
<p t="932139" d="5750">They don't assume that the best way to approach
reality is to break it up into the subjective</p>
<p t="937889" d="1241">and the objective.</p>
<p t="939130" d="5940">They presume instead that the way to approach
reality is by assuming that all your experience</p>
<p t="945070" d="1480">is real.</p>
<p t="946550" d="1000">All of it.</p>
<p t="947550" d="3500">Now that doesn't mean there aren't different
categories of experience, you know, because</p>
<p t="951050" d="6490">you could still say that a dream and the experience
you have walking—dreaming of walking down</p>
<p t="957540" d="5049">the street and walking down the street are
still different things, and the phenomenologists</p>
<p t="962589" d="5841">would say, “Yes, you can keep your categorical
distinctions intact, but you have to say that</p>
<p t="968430" d="2610">they're both real.”</p>
<p t="971040" d="4400">Now, this is an assumption and I told you
why the assumption is generated.</p>
<p t="975440" d="4079">Part of the reason the assumption is generated—the
alternative assumption—is because there</p>
<p t="979519" d="6101">are problems that emerge with the set of assumptions
that make up the scientific worldview.</p>
<p t="985620" d="5170">Now it's not that surprising that the scientific
worldview can't encompass the subjective</p>
<p t="990790" d="7280">because the scientific worldview was actually
established—by Bacon and Decartes say and</p>
<p t="998070" d="8780">by other thinkers of that time—it was set
up to exclude the subjective from the conceptualization</p>
<p t="1006850" d="1420">of objective reality.</p>
<p t="1008270" d="4439">So you can't really criticize science because
it does that, but you can say the fact that</p>
<p t="1012709" d="7661">the subjective is excluded is a fault, or
at least an incompleteness, and that incompleteness</p>
<p t="1020370" d="6550">sometimes has extraordinarily serious consequences
that you can't just dismiss.</p>
<p t="1026920" d="6280">Because you might say, “Well, had the Russians—the
Soviets—been successful in crossing Ebola</p>
<p t="1033200" d="4900">with smallpox and aerosolizing it then we
might all be dead,” and then you might think</p>
<p t="1038100" d="8440">that any theory that leads everyone to be
dead might reasonably be criticized for its</p>
<p t="1046540" d="2030">assumption to universal truth.</p>
<p t="1048570" d="7200">Now, you can debate that and rightly so, but
all I'm pointing out is there are reasons</p>
<p t="1055770" d="2470">to go at this from another approach.</p>
<p t="1058240" d="10180">Now, it was Rogers' basic assumption that
you were more likely to be properly oriented</p>
<p t="1068420" d="8790">in life if you adopted a phenomenological
approach to your experience and to break up</p>
<p t="1077210" d="1480">reality in that manner.</p>
<p t="1078690" d="5690">So let me give you an example.</p>
<p t="1084380" d="6490">When my daughter was about three, she had
a nightmare and she came running into her</p>
<p t="1090870" d="3300">parents' bedroom.</p>
<p t="1094170" d="6220">And she told me her dream and she was all
upset by it.</p>
<p t="1100390" d="3281">She might've even been younger than three
at that point.</p>
<p t="1103671" d="5919">And she had dreamed that there was a clear
stream and that it was quite beautiful and</p>
<p t="1109590" d="3329">that there was garbage littering the bottom
of it.</p>
<p t="1112919" d="4151">Now by that time, you know, she—kids are
quite sophisticated in their ability to categorize,</p>
<p t="1117070" d="1000">you know.</p>
<p t="1118070" d="3520">By that time she'd already learned the difference
between kid things and adult things, and you</p>
<p t="1121590" d="6959">think, that's a bloody complex form of discrimination,
you know, because what objective features</p>
<p t="1128549" d="4331">do adult things share in common that differentiates
them from kid things?</p>
<p t="1132880" d="4230">You can't actually come up with a set of
objective criteria that allows that distinction</p>
<p t="1137110" d="4730">to be made, but kids, by the time they're
three, have got a pretty clear grasp of that.</p>
<p t="1141840" d="2070">So they can come up with very sophisticated
classifications.</p>
<p t="1143910" d="7570">About the same time, one of my friends had
a two-year-old who went outside their house</p>
<p t="1151480" d="3189">one day, looked down the street, and there
were a couple of garbage cans knocked over.</p>
<p t="1154669" d="1851">And the kid said, “Uh oh.”</p>
<p t="1156520" d="4390">And, you know, that's also extremely sophisticated
because you think, you know, a whole street</p>
<p t="1160910" d="6710">is a very complex set of visual stimuli and
to be able to glance at that and then to note</p>
<p t="1167620" d="4309">that something is out of place and then to
make an utterance of it to draw people's</p>
<p t="1171929" d="4750">attention to it is a ridiculously sophisticated
cognitive act.</p>
<p t="1176679" d="3441">And my daughter was doing the same thing within
the context of her dream.</p>
<p t="1180120" d="1880">So she was upset about this.</p>
<p t="1182000" d="3340">Now, it's quite interested, eh, because
you think, “Well, why would someone who</p>
<p t="1185340" d="7860">was three be upset about the fact that a stream—a
beautiful, clear stream—had garbage in it?”</p>
<p t="1193200" d="5680">You know, it's a really—it's like innate
environmentalism or something like that.</p>
<p t="1198880" d="3510">Innate concern for the environment and that
could easily be the case, you know.</p>
<p t="1202390" d="5980">I mean if we fouled our environment up continually
during our evolutionary history that was likely</p>
<p t="1208370" d="1570">to have very negative consequences.</p>
<p t="1209940" d="3660">Even birds clean their own nests and so do
bees and, you know, they keep their hives</p>
<p t="1213600" d="1000">clean and all that.</p>
<p t="1214600" d="3350">So it could be a very primordial instinct.</p>
<p t="1217950" d="3530">Anyways, she came in with this dream and she
was quite upset.</p>
<p t="1221480" d="2770">And then you think there are a couple of things
you could do about that.</p>
<p t="1224250" d="3080">You could say, “It's just a dream.</p>
<p t="1227330" d="1820">Don't worry about it.</p>
<p t="1229150" d="5470">Go back to sleep,” but, you know, that's
a philosophical statement, right, and it's</p>
<p t="1234620" d="5679">a misleading one, or you could argue that
it was a misleading one, because what does</p>
<p t="1240299" d="2461">“It's just a dream mean?”</p>
<p t="1242760" d="6230">Well, it means that it's certainly not something
to take seriously like you would take something</p>
<p t="1248990" d="2530">that occurred during the day seriously.</p>
<p t="1251520" d="14360">It's a mere fantasy but with the definition
of fantasy being some fundamentally useless</p>
<p t="1265880" d="7311">act of play, I suppose, that you can ignore
with no consequences, and not only that that</p>
<p t="1273191" d="1599">you should ignore it.</p>
<p t="1274790" d="8050">And, you know, that's not necessarily true
because then you're making the case, or</p>
<p t="1282840" d="4120">you might be making the case, that you don't
have to pay attention to products of your</p>
<p t="1286960" d="1620">imagination.</p>
<p t="1288580" d="4450">That seems like a pretty dopey thing to tell
a child given A, that anything creative that</p>
<p t="1293030" d="5070">you ever produce is going to come out of your
imagination and B, the way that you set goals</p>
<p t="1298100" d="4439">and plans for your future is by imagining
them—dreaming about them, right?</p>
<p t="1302539" d="2071">Everyone knows what it means to pursue a dream.</p>
<p t="1304610" d="3530">And, you know, you might say, “Well, if
you're depressed it means all you dreams</p>
<p t="1308140" d="1060">have disappeared.”</p>
<p t="1309200" d="6150">It's like, so maybe you shouldn't be telling
your child that it's just a dream and so</p>
<p t="1315350" d="2391">you can ignore it and go back to sleep, you
know.</p>
<p t="1317741" d="4009">You don't know exactly what you're doing
when you do that.</p>
<p t="1321750" d="5309">You're certainly not paying attention to
the child's experience because she did have</p>
<p t="1327059" d="3591">that image and it did make her upset, and
those are facts.</p>
<p t="1330650" d="3159">And as far as people like Rogers would be
concerned, those are facts about reality,</p>
<p t="1333809" d="5321">or they're elements of reality, and they
should be dealt with as such.</p>
<p t="1339130" d="7560">So, I told her to close her eyes and to bring
the dream image up in her imagination, which</p>
<p t="1346690" d="7229">she could do very well, and then to imagine
that she had some rubber boots on and that</p>
<p t="1353919" d="3871">she could go into the stream and pick out
the garbage and put it in a garbage bag and</p>
<p t="1357790" d="2980">that there was a garbage can nearby and that
she could put it in the garbage can.</p>
<p t="1360770" d="5450">And so we went through that and that calmed
her down and then she went back to bed.</p>
<p t="1366220" d="7860">And then you might say, “Well, what am I
doing doing that?”</p>
<p t="1374080" d="2590">Because you might say, “Well, that's just
a fantasy, just like the dream, and because</p>
<p t="1376670" d="3490">they're just fantasies neither of them have
anything to do with reality.”</p>
<p t="1380160" d="5700">But, you know, that again is not a very sophisticated
way of thinking because the dream presented</p>
<p t="1385860" d="3770">my daughter with a problem, or you could even
say a class of problems.</p>
<p t="1389630" d="7830">And the class of problems includes all of
those things that people do, and other animals,</p>
<p t="1397460" d="4150">of course—all the ways that the environment
can be defiled.</p>
<p t="1401610" d="5090">Well, that actually is an existential problem.</p>
<p t="1406700" d="4020">And then you might say, “Well, what should
you do about it?” and the answer to that</p>
<p t="1410720" d="4589">might be, “Well, maybe you should do something
about it insofar as you can do something about</p>
<p t="1415309" d="4361">it,” because then you're conceptualizing
yourself as an active agent and not just a</p>
<p t="1419670" d="4720">passive victim or a passive recipient of the
problem.</p>
<p t="1424390" d="3840">You could actually do something about it,
and that's a way different message than</p>
<p t="1428230" d="4400">“It's just a dream; you can ignore it
and go back to sleep.”</p>
<p t="1432630" d="3240">You know, maybe you shouldn't actually tell
your child to be ignoring reality and go back</p>
<p t="1435870" d="1000">to sleep.</p>
<p t="1436870" d="4080">Maybe you should be telling them to wake up,
and see reality as clearly as they possibly</p>
<p t="1440950" d="4340">can, and not ignore any of it including their
fantasies and their dreams.</p>
<p t="1445290" d="4970">And that doesn't mean that their fantasies
have the same reality as the reality that</p>
<p t="1450260" d="5160">you experience with everyone else, but that
fact that it's not the same reality that</p>
<p t="1455420" d="4610">you experience with everyone else doesn't
mean it's not reality.</p>
<p t="1460030" d="11870">Now Rogers would claim, for example, that
to ignore a private experience warps you fundamentally.</p>
<p t="1471900" d="5890">So, here are the basic outlines of his view
of the world.</p>
<p t="1477790" d="4740">So there's first of all: You exist within
phenomenological field.</p>
<p t="1482530" d="6389">Now, phenomenon comes from the Greek word
“phainein” and phainein means to shine</p>
<p t="1488919" d="1931">forth.</p>
<p t="1490850" d="4750">And so phenomena are those things that shine
forth for you.</p>
<p t="1495600" d="7120">Now, the way to understand that is to imagine
that you're reading a book and maybe a passage</p>
<p t="1502720" d="2350">of it really strikes you as meaningful.</p>
<p t="1505070" d="2800">Well, then you might say, “Well, why?”</p>
<p t="1507870" d="2460">There are lots of passages in the book.</p>
<p t="1510330" d="5680">If someone else was reading the book it's
not obvious that the same passage would strike</p>
<p t="1516010" d="1130">them.</p>
<p t="1517140" d="4779">And then you might say, “Well, is that a
consequence of the structure of you as an</p>
<p t="1521919" d="4130">interpreter of the book or is it a consequence
of the contents of the book?” and the answer</p>
<p t="1526049" d="5971">to that is you actually can't tell, because
the book is neither the thing that's printed</p>
<p t="1532020" d="1000">nor the reader.</p>
<p t="1533020" d="5980">The book is the interaction between the reader
and the book, and that interaction is actually</p>
<p t="1539000" d="4070">unique for each person even though there are
some commonalities across people—because</p>
<p t="1543070" d="5359">otherwise you wouldn't even be able to talk
about a book.</p>
<p t="1548429" d="7741">Well, regardless, when you're interacting
with someone some things announce themselves</p>
<p t="1556170" d="5030">on your field of consciousness and some things
don't and so the phenomenologists would</p>
<p t="1561200" d="4130">say, “Well, some things shine forth for
you while other things don't.”</p>
<p t="1565330" d="9090">It's a little bit like one of Jung's ideas
about the development of the self.</p>
<p t="1574420" d="4660">Jung believed that if you followed things
that if you followed things that announced</p>
<p t="1579080" d="7210">themselves to you as meaningful, that they
would take you through a descent to begin</p>
<p t="1586290" d="4780">with—where you would encounter things you
were afraid of or terrified of and disgusted</p>
<p t="1591070" d="4540">by and wanted to avoid—and then the consequence
of that would be that you would incorporate</p>
<p t="1595610" d="2610">a lot of new material into your personality.</p>
<p t="1598220" d="4680">And the consequence of that would be you'd
be reborn, roughly speaking, as a stronger</p>
<p t="1602900" d="3600">person, and then if you just kept doing that
all the time for the rest of your life in</p>
<p t="1606500" d="5220">small or large ways that you'd become more
and more and more fully differentiated and</p>
<p t="1611720" d="1000">developed.</p>
<p t="1612720" d="7020">And he would have said that the ultimate potential
target of that kind of development was what</p>
<p t="1619740" d="2290">he described as the self.</p>
<p t="1622030" d="7450">The self is a multi-faceted conceptualization,
so that's not all there is to it, but the</p>
<p t="1629480" d="4410">self, from the Jungian perspective is who
you could be if you could be who you most</p>
<p t="1633890" d="7970">deeply are; if you didn't shy away from
anything; if you accurately encountered and</p>
<p t="1641860" d="3929">then integrated, even in the Piagetian sense,
your experience.</p>
<p t="1645789" d="4140">Now that's exactly the same idea that Rogers
had.</p>
<p t="1649929" d="6431">He believed that there's a phenomenal field
and it's full of experience.</p>
<p t="1656360" d="3790">All of your experience manifests itself as
the phenomenal field.</p>
<p t="1660150" d="3820">It's quite interesting because that means
also that other people are part of your phenomenal</p>
<p t="1663970" d="3620">field—part of your experience.</p>
<p t="1667590" d="7260">And then within that field there's a circumscribed
area that he described as the self.</p>
<p t="1674850" d="2080">Now that's different than the Jungian self.</p>
<p t="1676930" d="2700">So it's a little terminologically confusing.</p>
<p t="1679630" d="5970">Rogers' self is more like Freud's ego,
but Rogers would define the self as though</p>
<p t="1685600" d="9740">aspects of the phenomenological field that
you call “I.” “I felt like…”</p>
<p t="1695340" d="8240">I've had clients who tended to talk in the
third person about their emotions, or they</p>
<p t="1703580" d="1690">would say, “The body.”</p>
<p t="1705270" d="1769">They wouldn't say I.</p>
<p t="1707039" d="6971">Maybe they're describing cutting themselves
and they would say, “Well, the body needed</p>
<p t="1714010" d="2330">to be cut.”</p>
<p t="1716340" d="8760">And what Rogers would say about that was that
the person existed in the phenomenological</p>
<p t="1725100" d="7090">field and part of that phenomenological field
was demarcated by the self but the self hadn't</p>
<p t="1732190" d="4910">expanded to incorporate as much of that phenomenological
field as it should've.</p>
<p t="1737100" d="6280">Another concept that he had was the concept
of the organism.</p>
<p t="1743380" d="6510">Now, you could think of the self as what you
identify as “I,” and then you can think</p>
<p t="1749890" d="5279">of the organism as all those things that are
unique to you that you might identify as the</p>
<p t="1755169" d="1000">“I.”</p>
<p t="1756169" d="4331">Now it's tricky, eh, because imagine that
you get angry during a fight with someone—argument—and</p>
<p t="1760500" d="4160">they say, “You're angry,” and you say,
“No, I'm not.”</p>
<p t="1764660" d="2740">It's like, what exactly are you doing there?</p>
<p t="1767400" d="3129">The other person—we're going to assume
the other person's right for the sake of</p>
<p t="1770529" d="9241">this argument—they can clearly see that
you're angry but you're not allowing the</p>
<p t="1779770" d="5600">organismic manifestation of that motivational
state or that emotion to be incorporated with</p>
<p t="1785370" d="4400">those things that you identify with.</p>
<p t="1789770" d="9769">Rogers would call that incongruence, and he
believed that incongruence was roughly equivalent</p>
<p t="1799539" d="14811">to psychopathology so that part of your goal
was for the organism to respond appropriately</p>
<p t="1814350" d="4860">to the broader phenomenological field—now
we can talk about what appropriately means,</p>
<p t="1819210" d="3940">but we won't do that yet—and then what
the self was supposed to do was accurately</p>
<p t="1823150" d="6860">symbolically represent organismic responses
to the broader phenomenological field.</p>
<p t="1830010" d="6049">So, now you can see that there are similarities
to that concept as say Freud's idea of the</p>
<p t="1836059" d="1411">ego and the Id.</p>
<p t="1837470" d="5500">You know, because the Id was this sort of
external thing, which was home of motivational</p>
<p t="1842970" d="7540">and emotional forces that couldn't be easily
integrated into the ego and partly because</p>
<p t="1850510" d="3169">the superego said, for example, that they
were wrong.</p>
<p t="1853679" d="4561">So there are these sets of phenomena, you
know, that all of the different clinicians</p>
<p t="1858240" d="5000">are talking about, but all of them are talking
about it starting from different initial presuppositions.</p>
<p t="1863240" d="5540">It's like a group of people in a room shining
a flashlight on a very complex object.</p>
<p t="1868780" d="2529">You know, they're all standing in a slightly
different position.</p>
<p t="1871309" d="4590">The complex object is the same thing but you
can only see parts of it so you need multiple</p>
<p t="1875899" d="6211">different ways of looking at things so you
can come up with a cohesive and coherent account</p>
<p t="1882110" d="4280">of something that's actually beyond your
understanding because, of course, not only</p>
<p t="1886390" d="7919">can you not accurately symbolically represent
the phenomenological—the entire domain of</p>
<p t="1894309" d="8921">your being—you can't accurately represent
even the aspect of that field that's related</p>
<p t="1903230" d="2240">to the organismic you.</p>
<p t="1905470" d="6750">There's part of you on top that you identify
with “I,” roughly speaking, and it's</p>
<p t="1912220" d="4900">trying to model a model of something very
complex and, of course, that's extraordinarily</p>
<p t="1917120" d="1000">difficult.</p>
<p t="1918120" d="2659">Now, why is it doing that?</p>
<p t="1920779" d="4311">That's the central mystery of consciousness,
you know.</p>
<p t="1925090" d="5059">There's this problem that consciousness
researchers always refer to.</p>
<p t="1930149" d="2010">It's annoyingly termed I think.</p>
<p t="1932159" d="6411">It's called the “Zombie Problem,” and
the Zombie problem is: Why is consciousness</p>
<p t="1938570" d="2020">necessary?</p>
<p t="1940590" d="6310">Why is it necessary for something complex
like a human being to actually have awareness</p>
<p t="1946900" d="1000">and self-awareness?</p>
<p t="1947900" d="5450">Why couldn't it just wander through the
world reacting in pre-determined, deterministic</p>
<p t="1953350" d="2080">fashion zombie-like.</p>
<p t="1955430" d="4160">No awareness—robot-like, let's say.</p>
<p t="1959590" d="6059">What's consciousness for?</p>
<p t="1965649" d="4661">Rogers doesn't really discuss that and so
we won't at the moment although I think</p>
<p t="1970310" d="3229">there are some reasonable ideas.</p>
<p t="1973539" d="5561">Consciousness, for example, allows you to
generalize between certain phenomena.</p>
<p t="1979100" d="6600">Anyways, regardless, there are the self, the
organism, and the broader phenomenological</p>
<p t="1985700" d="3790">field.</p>
<p t="1989490" d="12470">Let's say you go into a pub—bar—and
you've been there many times and so you</p>
<p t="2001960" d="3550">know the people in there, you know where to
sit, you know what's going to happen, you've</p>
<p t="2005510" d="1159">met friends there.</p>
<p t="2006669" d="7941">You might say that your organism exists, at
least in part, as a very accurate model of</p>
<p t="2014610" d="2929">that broader phenomenological world.</p>
<p t="2017539" d="13071">And then, inside that, you're aware of your
knowledge of the bar, and so if your organism</p>
<p t="2030610" d="7620">is properly adapted to the broader phenomenological
field, when you go into the bar or other familiar</p>
<p t="2038230" d="7350">place, things that you expect and want happen
instead of things that neither expect or want.</p>
<p t="2045580" d="5120">And you could say, “Well, perhaps that's
a reasonable definition of adaptation.”</p>
<p t="2050700" d="5229">Now, this isn't biological or evolutionary
adaptation; this is personal adaptation.</p>
<p t="2055929" d="4090">They're similar in some ways but importantly
different.</p>
<p t="2060019" d="4971">I mean you could be adapted to an environment
without that in any way having any effect</p>
<p t="2064990" d="4389">whatsoever on your evolutionary adaptiveness.</p>
<p t="2069379" d="11121">Now, if maybe you're not very well organismically-adapted
to the environment—you have a model of it—and</p>
<p t="2080500" d="4649">because of that when you go somewhere familiar,
people don't like you as much as you think</p>
<p t="2085149" d="5000">they do and you're not nearly as much of
a master of that situation as you think you</p>
<p t="2090149" d="1000">are.</p>
<p t="2091149" d="4380">And one of the consequences of that—so that
would mean that your self-representation is</p>
<p t="2095529" d="5990">too rigid and simplistic and full of defenses
to notice the discrepancy between your organism</p>
<p t="2101519" d="3300">and the broader environment, and that's
pathological.</p>
<p t="2104819" d="4441">And the way that that's going to be marked
is, first, by anxiety.</p>
<p t="2109260" d="2699">You know, maybe you tell a joke—there are
some people sitting around you—you tell</p>
<p t="2111959" d="4061">a joke and you see people kind of, you know,
making that face, and maybe rolling their</p>
<p t="2116020" d="1000">eyes.</p>
<p t="2117020" d="3099">It's like, well that's not exactly—you
might think, “Well, they're joking.</p>
<p t="2120119" d="1000">You know, they're just teasing me.”</p>
<p t="2121119" d="3240">Well, maybe they're not; maybe they're
damn sick of your stupid stories, and you've</p>
<p t="2124359" d="3081">told them fifty times, and you're not very
funny, and they'd rather you weren't in</p>
<p t="2127440" d="1929">the bar at all.</p>
<p t="2129369" d="4811">And it may be that you'll actually notice
that, but you don't necessarily notice it</p>
<p t="2134180" d="3830">in a fully symbolically-developed way.</p>
<p t="2138010" d="6640">Now, what that would mean is maybe you start
feeling anxiety, and Rogers identifies different</p>
<p t="2144650" d="2669">levels of feeling.</p>
<p t="2147319" d="5770">It might start with the subception, and to
subcede something, which is a word that I</p>
<p t="2153089" d="10371">guess comes from general semantics, is to
have the event affect the way that you're</p>
<p t="2163460" d="4649">interacting with the world in ways that you
don't necessarily notice.</p>
<p t="2168109" d="5121">So it's sort of equivalent to the idea of
subliminal when you talk about advertising.</p>
<p t="2173230" d="4829">A message is flashed at you and it subtly
changes the way that you interact with the</p>
<p t="2178059" d="1230">world but you don't notice that.</p>
<p t="2179289" d="1570">And that happens to people all the time.</p>
<p t="2180859" d="2480">I mean it's actually a part of our normal
cognitive structure.</p>
<p t="2183339" d="5081">I mean when you walk into this room, the room
tells you all sorts of things about how to</p>
<p t="2188420" d="4740">behave, and you don't notice that the room
is telling you those things because you know</p>
<p t="2193160" d="2849">what it's telling you so well that you just
act it out.</p>
<p t="2196009" d="4830">You don't need to go through all the complex
processes of actually perceiving and thinking</p>
<p t="2200839" d="1000">about it.</p>
<p t="2201839" d="6361">And so Rogers' point is that you can detect
things organismically that will affect the</p>
<p t="2208200" d="4819">nature of your experience without necessarily
either even perceiving that or definitely</p>
<p t="2213019" d="2560">not symbolically representing it.</p>
<p t="2215579" d="6131">Now, maybe the social discomfort that's
inherent in the situation rises up to the</p>
<p t="2221710" d="1119">level of perception.</p>
<p t="2222829" d="2410">That's not symbolization yet.</p>
<p t="2225239" d="5110">Then you might think, “Well, what does it
feel like to be anxious?”</p>
<p t="2230349" d="5561">Well, and I'm not asking, “What are the
objective markers of being anxious?” because</p>
<p t="2235910" d="1720">we actually don't know those.</p>
<p t="2237630" d="3169">We can kind of infer them.</p>
<p t="2240799" d="3921">Sometimes people's heart rate goes up, but
sometimes it decelerates, and then there are</p>
<p t="2244720" d="4549">facial expressions that are associated with
anxiety but you have to use those to infer.</p>
<p t="2249269" d="3941">If you get anxious, I don't feel your anxiety;
I have to infer it.</p>
<p t="2253210" d="2659">But if you get anxious, you feel your anxiety.</p>
<p t="2255869" d="3831">And so then the question might be, “Well,
what does it mean to feel anxious?”</p>
<p t="2259700" d="5409">Well, that's a hard question, and the reason
it's a hard question is because you never</p>
<p t="2265109" d="4670">have to answer it because if you tell someone,
“I feel anxious,” then they refer to their</p>
<p t="2269779" d="2881">own feelings of anxiety and then they know
what you mean.</p>
<p t="2272660" d="5780">And you never have to come up with an explanation
of what it feels like.</p>
<p t="2278440" d="4849">The idea that the feeling is an element of
experience is something that we just take</p>
<p t="2283289" d="1240">for granted, you know.</p>
<p t="2284529" d="1080">“I got angry today.”</p>
<p t="2285609" d="1000">Everybody nods.</p>
<p t="2286609" d="3390">Or maybe I tell a little story and I say,
“Well, you know, I got on a bus and I was</p>
<p t="2289999" d="4270">missing like two cents, and I asked the bus
driver if he would let me get on the bus and</p>
<p t="2294269" d="1000">he didn't.</p>
<p t="2295269" d="4000">And that really annoyed me because I take
that bus everyday and the driver knows me.</p>
<p t="2299269" d="2040">And I got angry,” and everybody'll nod.</p>
<p t="2301309" d="4260">And the reason they nod is, well partly because
they can imagine that that's how they would've</p>
<p t="2305569" d="6200">reacted in that situation, but even more importantly,
they accept the reality of angry as a response</p>
<p t="2311769" d="2661">and they know what it feels like.</p>
<p t="2314430" d="6990">So, but explaining it: that's a much more
difficult thing.</p>
<p t="2321420" d="4949">So the point is is that you can have experiences
that you know of—first of all you can have</p>
<p t="2326369" d="1500">experiences that you don't know of.</p>
<p t="2327869" d="1881">That would be the subceived experiences.</p>
<p t="2329750" d="4959">Then you can have experiences that you perceive
but that you haven't symbolically represented,</p>
<p t="2334709" d="3120">and those might be emotional or motivational
experiences.</p>
<p t="2337829" d="4601">And then you can have experiences that you
have symbolically represented in a way that</p>
<p t="2342430" d="5579">captures their gist accurately in a way that's
reflective or your adaptation, or lack thereof,</p>
<p t="2348009" d="2651">of the broader phenomenological world.</p>
<p t="2350660" d="5939">And Rogers would say that latter state is
preferable.</p>
<p t="2356599" d="6311">You know how to act or you know that you didn't
act properly and you know how to fix it, which</p>
<p t="2362910" d="4599">is almost as good, and you represent that
accurately.</p>
<p t="2367509" d="6330">Now, you might imagine that you could concentrate
on the mismatch between organismic responses</p>
<p t="2373839" d="1301">and the environment.</p>
<p t="2375140" d="3010">That's what behavior therapist really do.</p>
<p t="2378150" d="4399">They say, “Well, how are you acting and
what are the consequences?”</p>
<p t="2382549" d="3410">But that isn't really where Rogers goes.</p>
<p t="2385959" d="5860">Rogers is more psychoanalytic than the behavior
therapists, and what he seems to be primarily</p>
<p t="2391819" d="7260">concerned about is whether or not your self-representation
is an accurate representation of how your</p>
<p t="2399079" d="1490">organism is responding.</p>
<p t="2400569" d="4880">In some sense, for Rogers, the organism takes
the place of God.</p>
<p t="2405449" d="3890">It's more or less omniscient.</p>
<p t="2409339" d="5301">So your organism is going to tell you the
truth in every situation and it's up to</p>
<p t="2414640" d="5250">you whether or not your going to pay attention
to that and make sense of it or whether you're</p>
<p t="2419890" d="6040">going to engage in any of the different kinds
of shenanigans that you might engage in to</p>
<p t="2425930" d="5689">stop yourself from going through the complex
process of symbolization.</p>
<p t="2431619" d="4390">Because you might say—well, you're back
in the bar—and you might say, well, you</p>
<p t="2436009" d="5540">noticed the anxiety and then, you know, different
ways of symbolizing it come to mind.</p>
<p t="2441549" d="6101">“These people are all just jerks,” and
then another thing that comes to mind is,</p>
<p t="2447650" d="2260">“Well, maybe nobody likes me.”</p>
<p t="2449910" d="6389">And then maybe another idea that's associated
with symbolization comes to mind that is,</p>
<p t="2456299" d="6010">“Well, maybe there are elements of my social
behavior that I should adjust,” and I presume</p>
<p t="2462309" d="5851">that if Rogers was having a conversation with
one of his clients he would assume that that</p>
<p t="2468160" d="5010">was the most fruitful potential step towards
accurate symbolization.</p>
<p t="2473170" d="9100">Now, Rogers felt that anxiety emerged when
the self-concept was not accurately symbolically</p>
<p t="2482270" d="5370">representing the organism's experiences,
and so that would be, in some sense: If you're</p>
<p t="2487640" d="7490">a house divided within yourself then you're
pathological from a Rogerian perspective.</p>
<p t="2495130" d="7119">And you can think about that, in some sense,
as a move away from necessary simplicity.</p>
<p t="2502249" d="8431">I mean if your self-concept is set up properly
it doesn't contain contradictory and misleading</p>
<p t="2510680" d="2829">bits of information; everything works seamlessly
together.</p>
<p t="2513509" d="5911">And so what that would mean is that you think
about something, you act it out, and it works.</p>
<p t="2519420" d="6030">And then that's an indication that the organization
between, say, these three different levels</p>
<p t="2525450" d="4379">of being is—well the right word is isomorphic.</p>
<p t="2529829" d="3400">Each represents the other with sufficient
accuracy.</p>
<p t="2533229" d="7120">And so that means that you're congruent,
and if you're congruent then the world is</p>
<p t="2540349" d="5430">treating you not only in the manner that you
want to be treated but also in the manner</p>
<p t="2545779" d="8270">that's most likely to further your action
in the world as an organism.</p>
<p t="2554049" d="4660">And so that's partly why Rogers believed
that the organism had wisdom: it's because</p>
<p t="2558709" d="7421">its natural proclivity was to operate in the
world effectively and to expand its competence</p>
<p t="2566130" d="1570">at the same time.</p>
<p t="2567700" d="6530">Now, a self-actualized person—because that's
one of Rogers' phrases—is someone whose</p>
<p t="2574230" d="7089">self-concept accurately represents their organismic
being.</p>
<p t="2581319" d="12880">Now, Rogers was primarily a clinician as well
and his theories were derived from his clinical</p>
<p t="2594199" d="2280">experience.</p>
<p t="2596479" d="5000">And his theories informed his clinical practice.</p>
<p t="2601479" d="6471">And Rogers invented, or developed, what he
believed to be a new kind of therapy and he</p>
<p t="2607950" d="2100">called that “client-centered therapy.”</p>
<p t="2610050" d="4080">Now you've probably heard about student-centered
education.</p>
<p t="2614130" d="4030">I mean Rogers' ideas have had a tremendous
amount of influence, certainly not least in</p>
<p t="2618160" d="5649">educational psychology—also in conflict
reduction of various sorts.</p>
<p t="2623809" d="7060">If you start with Rogers' initial assumptions,
which are, first of all, that you should regard</p>
<p t="2630869" d="5880">your experience as real; second, that your
organism will give you accurate information</p>
<p t="2636749" d="8810">about the totality of experience; and third,
that your self-concept should accurately encompass</p>
<p t="2645559" d="5530">your actual experience, there are implications
of that theory for therapy.</p>
<p t="2651089" d="5431">And one of the implications is that you can
figure out what you should do if you want</p>
<p t="2656520" d="9469">to because your organism will tell you, or
at least hint at you, about which directions</p>
<p t="2665989" d="5850">are correct and which directions aren't,
and if you follow those then you're going</p>
<p t="2671839" d="4311">to naturally gravitate towards a state of
being where you're more and more accurately</p>
<p t="2676150" d="6359">represented by yourself but also that your
representation and your organism are going</p>
<p t="2682509" d="1860">to act more effectively in the world.</p>
<p t="2684369" d="3100">They're not bumping up against each other
all the time.</p>
<p t="2687469" d="8120">And, you know, they're not in conflict anymore,
and so that's the goal of the self-actualized</p>
<p t="2695589" d="3720">person.</p>
<p t="2699309" d="9240">And therapy, in part, is the art of furthering
that process of self-actualization.</p>
<p t="2708549" d="18520">Now, Rogers was opposed to diagnosis because
he felt that it didn't sufficiently represent</p>
<p t="2727069" d="13250">the vital minutia of the client's individual
experience, and I think that his claim was</p>
<p t="2740319" d="12020">extremely important, you know, because medicine—psychiatry—tends
to classify everything.</p>
<p t="2752339" d="5990">And you might say, “Well, are the psychiatric
diagnostic classifications real?” and then</p>
<p t="2758329" d="2891">the answer to that is: It depends on what
you mean by real.</p>
<p t="2761220" d="5819">And you might think, “Well, that's an
annoying answer,” but it is still the answer.</p>
<p t="2767039" d="6691">And so I could say if I was being cynical—although
I don't really think it's a cynical response—if</p>
<p t="2773730" d="6299">I willing to sound cynical, that the only
reason that psychiatrists diagnose their clients</p>
<p t="2780029" d="3001">is so that insurance companies pay the bills.</p>
<p t="2783030" d="4539">And I actually believe that that's more
true than the claim that the psychiatric diagnostic</p>
<p t="2787569" d="7260">categories actually capture the essence of
the person's problems.</p>
<p t="2794829" d="7960">In my clinical experience, classification
has had almost zero utility, and the reason</p>
<p t="2802789" d="2260">for that is because it's too low resolution.</p>
<p t="2805049" d="6440">It doesn't capture the individual properly
because the thing about a client—a clinical</p>
<p t="2811489" d="5720">client—is that it's precisely their individuality
that's the fundamental issue.</p>
<p t="2817209" d="5741">It's like, they have to make their way through
the world in their body, in their time, in</p>
<p t="2822950" d="10819">their position in culture, with their advantages
and disadvantages, and that requires a solution</p>
<p t="2833769" d="7550">that's unique in many ways and one that's
also personal.</p>
<p t="2841319" d="9270">And Rogers also wasn't a particularly great
fan of the psychoanalysts' tendency to look</p>
<p t="2850589" d="6180">for the causes of present behavior in past
events.</p>
<p t="2856769" d="9520">So he didn't regard fishing in the past
as a necessarily useful expedition, or as</p>
<p t="2866289" d="8451">a necessary expedition, although if issues
of the past came up in therapy he was perfectly</p>
<p t="2874740" d="2479">willing to deal with them.</p>
<p t="2877219" d="6310">He didn't accept the Freudian theory that
the fundamental cause of psychopathology was,</p>
<p t="2883529" d="5840">say, traumatic past experience.</p>
<p t="2889369" d="8771">Now, this gives Rogerian therapy a particular
flavor.</p>
<p t="2898140" d="1979">You could also call it “Non-directive therapy.”</p>
<p t="2900119" d="11880">Now, if you're a behavior therapist, you
might actively strategize with your client</p>
<p t="2911999" d="5761">about what they're going to do in the next
week and once they establish their goals you</p>
<p t="2917760" d="6420">might offer some hints about what strategies
they could use to monitor themselves and to</p>
<p t="2924180" d="3790">attain those goals, and maybe you'll even
have them keep track of it.</p>
<p t="2927970" d="3549">Rogers, generally speaking, wouldn't do
something that directive.</p>
<p t="2931519" d="8251">In fact, he strove not to unduly influence
the client's decisions about important future</p>
<p t="2939770" d="7819">events, and in that way he was quite similar
to Freud, because Freud would sit so the client</p>
<p t="2947589" d="5051">would be laying on a couch and Freud so that
the client—his patient actually—couldn't</p>
<p t="2952640" d="1000">see him.</p>
<p t="2953640" d="4229">And then he would listen to the person free-associate,
which in some sense means that they would</p>
<p t="2957869" d="9980">ramble on, and he was attempting by doing
that to facilitate the self-realization of</p>
<p t="2967849" d="3250">their own memories.</p>
<p t="2971099" d="3321">If things happened to you in the past and
they still cause you emotion—let's say</p>
<p t="2974420" d="4109">they're more than eighteen months old for
the sake of argument—Freud would assume</p>
<p t="2978529" d="6161">that if you kind of wandered around that memory
somewhat haphazardly and in an associational</p>
<p t="2984690" d="5919">way—the way conversations naturally unfold—that
you would bring things to light and that would</p>
<p t="2990609" d="5541">allow certain kinds of emotional expression,
and that, in fact, in itself would be curative.</p>
<p t="2996150" d="3240">But Freud didn't want to interfere with
that process or guide it to any great degree,</p>
<p t="2999390" d="3280">and Rogers was like that; he wanted you to
make your own decisions.</p>
<p t="3002670" d="12529">And so he believed that the therapeutic endeavor
could not occur unless certain conditions</p>
<p t="3015199" d="9481">were met, and the conditions were: Willingness
to tell the truth.</p>
<p t="3024680" d="8669">So when a client comes to see me, one of the
first things I tell them is: “You can tell</p>
<p t="3033349" d="7071">me anything you want—although you're perfectly
within your rights to maintain your privacy—you</p>
<p t="3040420" d="4980">can tell me anything you want but tell me
the truth as clearly as you can because if</p>
<p t="3045400" d="5459">you don't I don't know what's going
on with you and there's not any possibility</p>
<p t="3050859" d="6700">at all that this process will be useful if
we're talking about things that don't</p>
<p t="3057559" d="1000">exist.</p>
<p t="3058559" d="4331">So one condition is the person is willing
to come and see you; so that means they want</p>
<p t="3062890" d="1369">to transform.</p>
<p t="3064259" d="4501">The second precondition is that they're
going to communicate with you, and communication</p>
<p t="3068760" d="4020">means they're going to do their best to
tell the truth but the therapist takes the</p>
<p t="3072780" d="4319">same vow, in a sense.</p>
<p t="3077099" d="4210">And so one of the things that I tell my clients
is that I will never let them do anything</p>
<p t="3081309" d="3520">that makes me resent them.</p>
<p t="3084829" d="4601">So if I'm asked to step out of my way for
some reason to take an additional session</p>
<p t="3089430" d="6839">or maybe to meet them somewhere and I do it,
they can be assured that there won't be</p>
<p t="3096269" d="8711">a price that will be extracted from them later
for interfering with the smooth flow of my</p>
<p t="3104980" d="1099">day.</p>
<p t="3106079" d="5351">So, and the other thing that I do—and I've
learned this from Rogers and from the other</p>
<p t="3111430" d="5549">people that I've read—is that I'll listen
to people talk and then sometimes something</p>
<p t="3116979" d="2290">will occur to me.</p>
<p t="3119269" d="5700">And I don't think about it as I thought
something because I'm actually somewhat</p>
<p t="3124969" d="5201">a follower of Nietzsche's dictum, which
is that the fact that you think is no proof</p>
<p t="3130170" d="6119">that—the fact that you experience thoughts
is no proof that you thought them.</p>
<p t="3136289" d="1711">They just appeared.</p>
<p t="3138000" d="4009">Well, you don't think that you think up
your dreams, right?</p>
<p t="3142009" d="2280">You have your dreams.</p>
<p t="3144289" d="2080">There you are in bed; there are the dreams.</p>
<p t="3146369" d="1870">Are you having them?</p>
<p t="3148239" d="1860">Well, it doesn't seem like it.</p>
<p t="3150099" d="3561">It seems like you're experiencing them,
in some sense, the same way that you experience</p>
<p t="3153660" d="1000">the external word.</p>
<p t="3154660" d="2669">You're not voluntarily creating them.</p>
<p t="3157329" d="6030">Well, why do you think anything different
about your thoughts?</p>
<p t="3163359" d="3411">And that's a very useful thing to realize,
by the way, because otherwise you think you're</p>
<p t="3166770" d="2999">your thoughts and then if you have negative
thoughts, well then you assume that they're</p>
<p t="3169769" d="4020">true and they're not true just because you
think them.</p>
<p t="3173789" d="3020">They're just thoughts, and maybe they're
true and maybe they're useful and maybe</p>
<p t="3176809" d="1000">they're not.</p>
<p t="3177809" d="4970">So stepping back from them a little bit is
incredibly—it's like Buddhist detachment</p>
<p t="3182779" d="1000">in a sense.</p>
<p t="3183779" d="1340">It's an incredibly useful thing to do.</p>
<p t="3185119" d="3730">I mean that's another thing that's really
characteristic of modern people, especially</p>
<p t="3188849" d="1340">if they're smart.</p>
<p t="3190189" d="6370">They think they think, first of all, and second,
they think that the things they think are</p>
<p t="3196559" d="2631">true, and neither of those things are necessarily
true.</p>
<p t="3199190" d="12789">And abandoning your belief in them makes you
much less rigid and much more able to expand</p>
<p t="3211979" d="5830">your preconceptions or even radically change
them when the circumstances demand them.</p>
<p t="3217809" d="9731">So the person has to be wanting to change,
in principle in a positive direction; they</p>
<p t="3227540" d="1909">have to be willing to tell the truth.</p>
<p t="3229449" d="6731">Then the next element of Rogerian psychotherapy
is something that he called “unconditional</p>
<p t="3236180" d="9819">positive regard,” and unconditional positive
regard, in the Rogerian tradition, is something</p>
<p t="3245999" d="2970">like radical acceptance.</p>
<p t="3248969" d="5701">It's actually a hallmark of modern child
rearing techniques.</p>
<p t="3254670" d="8149">You should wholeheartedly accept all aspects
of the person's being.</p>
<p t="3262819" d="12290">Now, Rogers believed that, or posited that,
partly because he also believed in—what</p>
<p t="3275109" d="5561">was it called—conditions of worth.</p>
<p t="3280670" d="8720">Here's a condition of worth: “I don't
like you when you act like that.”</p>
<p t="3289390" d="5270">So imagine you tell a child that—“I don't
like you when you act like that”—and maybe</p>
<p t="3294660" d="4770">you tell them that about a bunch of things
that they do.</p>
<p t="3299430" d="9839">But maybe those are integral parts of the
child's being and by making your lack of</p>
<p t="3309269" d="6530">acceptance known you make it impossible for
the child to incorporate those aspects of</p>
<p t="3315799" d="5570">his organismal experience into his self-concept.</p>
<p t="3321369" d="5120">You can see echoes of the superego/ego idea
there.</p>
<p t="3326489" d="5240">And so Rogers would say, “Well, if someone
comes into psychotherapy and experiences unconditional</p>
<p t="3331729" d="5600">positive regard, that means that they'll
be able to reveal those elements of their</p>
<p t="3337329" d="7720">organismic experience that had been rejected,
say, by the social world and themselves; experience</p>
<p t="3345049" d="4920">them; and then potentially incorporate them
within the self concept and that that's</p>
<p t="3349969" d="5710">going to be a good thing, because Rogers is
a great believer in the natural inevitability</p>
<p t="3355679" d="7250">of positive transformation if you set that
up as your goal.</p>
<p t="3362929" d="4360">He also believes that that should be your
goal and that it's actually your natural</p>
<p t="3367289" d="8780">goal if, for example, you haven't been subjected
to arbitrary conditions of worth.</p>
<p t="3376069" d="9581">Now, I'm going to read you something that
Rogers wrote, which is quite interesting,</p>
<p t="3385650" d="3849">and I think I found it extremely effective.</p>
<p t="3389499" d="13641">Oh yes, that's another thing I should mention.</p>
<p t="3403140" d="12839">There is one other important assumption in
the idea of self-actualization.</p>
<p t="3415979" d="6460">The other thing that Rogers tried to ensure
that his clients developed is autonomy and</p>
<p t="3422439" d="1000">independence.</p>
<p t="3423439" d="8620">Now, for Rogers, there was very little difference
between the move towards autonomy and personal</p>
<p t="3432059" d="4260">independence and the process of self-actualization.</p>
<p t="3436319" d="15341">Now, given that we're looking back at Rogers'
work fifty years later, you might ask yourself</p>
<p t="3451660" d="9510">if autonomy and independence is a necessary
precondition for psychological health, because</p>
<p t="3461170" d="10310">you could make the case that productive interdependence
and more communal orientation is equally healthy—but</p>
<p t="3471480" d="6069">that's not a Rogerian presupposition.</p>
<p t="3477549" d="13170">So his ideal is the fully-functioning individual.</p>
<p t="3490719" d="8431">So here's his hypothesis with regards to
psychotherapy: “Assuming a minimal mutual</p>
<p t="3499150" d="6789">willingness to be in contact and to receive
communications, we may say that the greater</p>
<p t="3505939" d="4721">the communicated congruence of experience,
awareness and behavior on the part of one</p>
<p t="3510660" d="4539">individual, the more the ensuing relationship
will involve a tendency toward reciprocal</p>
<p t="3515199" d="6291">communication with the same qualities, mutually
accurate understanding of the communications,</p>
<p t="3521490" d="5049">improved psychological adjustment and functioning
in both parties, and mutual satisfaction in</p>
<p t="3526539" d="1191">the relationship.”</p>
<p t="3527730" d="2980">Okay, so let's unpack that.</p>
<p t="3530710" d="4079">“Assuming a minimal mutual willingness to
be in contact and to receive communications.”</p>
<p t="3534789" d="4690">Well, the first thing you might say is that's
pretty much the hallmark of a relationship,</p>
<p t="3539479" d="5270">right, because if you're not in contact,
well clearly you don't have a relationship,</p>
<p t="3544749" d="3510">and if you are in contact but you're not
communicating you probably don't have a</p>
<p t="3548259" d="2000">relationship either.</p>
<p t="3550259" d="7210">So and, you know, that also begs the question
of exactly what a relationship is for, and</p>
<p t="3557469" d="3500">that's something that's very much worth
considering because people don't really</p>
<p t="3560969" d="2230">usually know what a relationship is for.</p>
<p t="3563199" d="4580">They certainly know that as a general rule
they're going to pursue them but they don't</p>
<p t="3567779" d="5150">really have any idea, in some sense, what
the optimal state is or what the desired final</p>
<p t="3572929" d="1640">state should be.</p>
<p t="3574569" d="9061">Now of course the desired final state fifty
years ago was marriage, but it's certainly</p>
<p t="3583630" d="3669">the case now that most people who are couples
aren't married.</p>
<p t="3587299" d="5270">Now, you might ask yourself, “Well, what's
the utility of a relationship and what's</p>
<p t="3592569" d="2601">the utility of a long-term relationship?”</p>
<p t="3595170" d="14540">Well, a Rogerian answer to that would be:
The more based on trust the relationship is,</p>
<p t="3609710" d="6240">the more likely that you're going to be
in contact and receive communications, and</p>
<p t="3615950" d="12849">then, as a consequence of that, you're going
to become better and better at representing</p>
<p t="3628799" d="6331">your organismal experience within your self-concept
and that's going to facilitate your moment</p>
<p t="3635130" d="2819">towards self-awareness and self-actualization.</p>
<p t="3637949" d="5550">It's a two brains are better than one idea.</p>
<p t="3643499" d="4200">So we say, “Well, we established a relationship,
okay, and the goal of our relationship is</p>
<p t="3647699" d="2760">to make things better.”</p>
<p t="3650459" d="7060">And the way we make things better is by telling
the truth as you see it.</p>
<p t="3657519" d="6240">So, remember, this is a phenomenological theory
and so the truth that Rogers is talking about</p>
<p t="3663759" d="5740">isn't object truth, and I suspect that that's
at least in part because establishing objective</p>
<p t="3669499" d="5100">truth within the confines of a relationship
is—I think it's technically impossible.</p>
<p t="3674599" d="5000">And we talked about that before, because each
interaction between the members of a couple,</p>
<p t="3679599" d="5781">or people in any relationship is contaminated,
in a sense, by all of the other interactions</p>
<p t="3685380" d="4579">they've ever had plus everything they bring
to bear on the situation, and there's just</p>
<p t="3689959" d="3220">no untangling that objectively.</p>
<p t="3693179" d="1680">You know, “What did you mean when you said
that?”</p>
<p t="3694859" d="8580">Well, God, you know, you can argue about that
until the point of divorce and ten years afterwards,</p>
<p t="3703439" d="3531">you know, without ever coming to a satisfactory
conclusion.</p>
<p t="3706970" d="5339">Alright, “The greater the communicated congruence
of experience, awareness, and behavior on</p>
<p t="3712309" d="4610">the part of one individual, the more the ensuing
relationship will involve a tendency toward</p>
<p t="3716919" d="1920">reciprocal communication with the same qualities.”</p>
<p t="3718839" d="4670">Okay, so here's the idea: You go see a psychotherapist—a
Rogerian psychotherapist.</p>
<p t="3723509" d="6100">At least in principle, this is someone who's
mastered, or is attempting to master these</p>
<p t="3729609" d="2900">basic modes of being.</p>
<p t="3732509" d="4121">So what they're going to do is they'll
tell you, “I'm going to tell you the truth</p>
<p t="3736630" d="5919">as I see it,” and so they way I see that
happening in psychotherapy is that when someone</p>
<p t="3742549" d="6611">comes to see me I listen to them, and that
means that I'm not distracted by anything</p>
<p t="3749160" d="1000">else.</p>
<p t="3750160" d="1320">I'm not thinking about anything else.</p>
<p t="3751480" d="2770">I'm not thinking about what I'm going
to say next.</p>
<p t="3754250" d="2499">I'm not thinking about the things I have
to do today.</p>
<p t="3756749" d="4181">I'm not thinking about the last time I saw
this person.</p>
<p t="3760930" d="5960">I'm not allowing my attention to wander
away from the person, and then I'm watching</p>
<p t="3766890" d="5329">them and listening to them at the same time—and
those are the same things because to really</p>
<p t="3772219" d="1921">listen to someone you also have to watch them.</p>
<p t="3774140" d="5510">Because then you subceive perhaps, or perceive,
all the non-verbal elements of communication</p>
<p t="3779650" d="4490">that go along—well, partly with voice tone
but partly with eye direction and partly with</p>
<p t="3784140" d="2799">very subtle transformations of facial gestures.</p>
<p t="3786939" d="4140">So sometimes, for example, I see on my clients
that they'll all of a sudden turn into a</p>
<p t="3791079" d="1000">child.</p>
<p t="3792079" d="1000">It's very interesting.</p>
<p t="3793079" d="3920">It's like they'll be recounting some experience—it's
like fixation from a Freudian perspective.</p>
<p t="3796999" d="6131">They'll be describing some experience from
the distant past and for a second their expression</p>
<p t="3803130" d="2909">will approximate who they were when they were
six-years-old.</p>
<p t="3806039" d="4790">It's really something remarkable to see,
and you can see these things if you really</p>
<p t="3810829" d="1470">pay attention.</p>
<p t="3812299" d="11020">And then as they talk I'm watching what's
happening inside me as I listen to their words,</p>
<p t="3823319" d="2581">and all sorts of things will happen.</p>
<p t="3825900" d="3520">Sometimes I'll get an image or sometimes
I'll get a memory of something we talked</p>
<p t="3829420" d="1000">about before.</p>
<p t="3830420" d="4020">Or sometimes I'll notice that what they're
saying right now is different than something</p>
<p t="3834440" d="3779">they said five minutes ago and so then I'll
say, “Well, wait a second, you know.</p>
<p t="3838219" d="4890">I'm trying to understand what you're telling
me and I noticed that you just said this,</p>
<p t="3843109" d="3710">and it seems to imply this, but then, you
know, a couple of minutes ago, when we were</p>
<p t="3846819" d="4130">talking about that, then you said this and
I don't see how those two things are the</p>
<p t="3850949" d="1000">same.”</p>
<p t="3851949" d="7441">And I'm not doing that because I want them
to rectify the paradox; I'm doing that being</p>
<p t="3859390" d="1929">I want to understand what they are saying.</p>
<p t="3861319" d="4480">And if someone says A to you and then they
say B, you don't know what they're saying.</p>
<p t="3865799" d="2710">And so the question is for clarification.</p>
<p t="3868509" d="3030">There's no other direction than that.</p>
<p t="3871539" d="4121">And then maybe, you know, I'll have a little
image, like maybe the fragment of a dream,</p>
<p t="3875660" d="2790">and I'll say, “Wait a second.</p>
<p t="3878450" d="2720">When you said what you just said this is what
I experienced.”</p>
<p t="3881170" d="6039">And then maybe we'll talk for a while about
what that might mean and I can say to them</p>
<p t="3887209" d="5860">what—so, for example, sometimes people will
come to my office and they'll do all sorts</p>
<p t="3893069" d="1000">of strange things.</p>
<p t="3894069" d="8420">Like I had one client who had psychosomatic
epilepsy, and one of the first times I saw</p>
<p t="3902489" d="2901">her she had a seizure in my office.</p>
<p t="3905390" d="7070">And I was watching her and it didn't really
matter to me that she was having a seizure.</p>
<p t="3912460" d="2589">And I thought, “That's pretty weird,”
because normally when someone's having a</p>
<p t="3915049" d="3730">seizure it's like you get affected by it,
right?</p>
<p t="3918779" d="5920">I mean there are sensations that emerge in
your midsection, and there are thoughts of</p>
<p t="3924699" d="4990">emergency, you know, because your body, in
some sense, is mimicking their body—which</p>
<p t="3929689" d="3721">is what your body does all the time when you're
talking to people—and that produces a sense</p>
<p t="3933410" d="1000">of urgency.</p>
<p t="3934410" d="5040">And I sort of just watched her have this seizure
and I thought, “Oh, it's not real; it's</p>
<p t="3939450" d="1210">not a real seizure.”</p>
<p t="3940660" d="3679">But she was very good at it and, you know,
as far as she was concerned she couldn't</p>
<p t="3944339" d="2131">tell if the seizures were real or not.</p>
<p t="3946470" d="4930">And sometimes if you have psychogenic epilepsy
you've had an epileptic seizure at one point</p>
<p t="3951400" d="1159">that was genuine.</p>
<p t="3952559" d="5680">Well, it's exceptionally complicated and
it's not easy to develop psychogenic epilepsy,</p>
<p t="3958239" d="9530">but she had developed it and part of the reason
was that she thought that—she was toying</p>
<p t="3967769" d="7020">with the idea that existence as a psychiatric
patient would require less effort and responsibility.</p>
<p t="3974789" d="4641">And so she got tangled up at one point with
one of the mental hospitals and they diagnosed</p>
<p t="3979430" d="3319">her with paranoid schizophrenia, which is
not something I would recommend—especially</p>
<p t="3982749" d="6181">if you don't actually have it—because
once you've got the diagnosis, well are</p>
<p t="3988930" d="1109">you really going to know?</p>
<p t="3990039" d="1711">What's going to happen, eh?</p>
<p t="3991750" d="7439">You do something like that—you have a psychogenic
epileptic seizure and a variety of other symptoms—they're</p>
<p t="3999189" d="4580">the consequences of a very complex complex
in Jungian terms.</p>
<p t="4003769" d="3861">There's a secondary motivation in Freudian
terms.</p>
<p t="4007630" d="3840">You go through with the whole routine then
you end up in a psych hospital, and you see</p>
<p t="4011470" d="2389">four experts and they tell you you have paranoid
schizophrenia.</p>
<p t="4013859" d="2750">Do you really think you're going to not
believe that?</p>
<p t="4016609" d="1740">Or at least ten percent of you is going to
believe it.</p>
<p t="4018349" d="2190">You're going to wonder after that.</p>
<p t="4020539" d="3430">And if another twenty people tell you that
and you're put on medication, which you</p>
<p t="4023969" d="4721">could easily be, then a year later, well,
you might still not have paranoid schizophrenia</p>
<p t="4028690" d="3799">but you are not going to be doing very well.</p>
<p t="4032489" d="7950">So, well that's a good example of what happens
when your self-concept and organismic valuing</p>
<p t="4040439" d="3380">systems aren't working carefully in tandem.</p>
<p t="4043819" d="6970">Anyways, so someone might be telling me a
story that's, you know, about something</p>
<p t="4050789" d="3740">terrible that happened to them and I'll
just be sitting there like a brick wall.</p>
<p t="4054529" d="3031">It's like, “You're not affecting me.”</p>
<p t="4057560" d="1309">And sometimes I'll tell people that.</p>
<p t="4058869" d="2650">It's like: “I don't know why, you know,
that's a pretty terrible story but I'm</p>
<p t="4061519" d="3160">having no emotional response to it at all.</p>
<p t="4064679" d="2850">Do you have any idea why that might be?”</p>
<p t="4067529" d="5102">Well then, you know, often people aren't
very happy when you tell them that, and that's</p>
<p t="4072631" d="1000">fine.</p>
<p t="4073631" d="1000">They can be unhappy with that.</p>
<p t="4074631" d="3128">That's perfectly okay, but the thing is
now they know that there's at least one</p>
<p t="4077759" d="4621">person that they've communicated with that's
actually telling them the truth who is actually</p>
<p t="4082380" d="2599">not affected by their story.</p>
<p t="4084979" d="5340">Because, look, if someone sits down beside
you and they tell you a terrible story, the</p>
<p t="4090319" d="3720">probability that you're going to tell them
that that had no effect on you is basically</p>
<p t="4094039" d="5180">zero because it's really rude not to be
negatively affected by someone who's telling</p>
<p t="4099219" d="3161">you a very sad story.</p>
<p t="4102380" d="2549">But if you're negatively affected by it
and it's not true then you're not doing</p>
<p t="4104929" d="3701">them any good at all; all you're doing is
providing them with evidence to maintain what</p>
<p t="4108630" d="4080">could easily become a delusion if they worked
on it long enough.</p>
<p t="4112710" d="4410">By contrast, sometimes people will come into
my office and they'll tell me something</p>
<p t="4117120" d="6780">that just seems trivial and it'll make me
tear up, which mean I can actually feel emotions.</p>
<p t="4123900" d="5040">It'll make me tear up and it's just some
thing that they barely allude to, you know.</p>
<p t="4128940" d="6399">Like a client a while back told me that—we
had had a session, a family session, where</p>
<p t="4135339" d="6200">I had suggested to some of the members of
this person's family that things might go</p>
<p t="4141539" d="9010">better for them and their child, who was one
of my clients, if for the next two weeks what</p>
<p t="4150549" d="8710">they practiced doing was watching each other's
behaviour during the day and finding one thing</p>
<p t="4159259" d="2170">that they could make a positive comment about.</p>
<p t="4161429" d="1940">Now, and this isn't a game.</p>
<p t="4163369" d="2810">Like if you play it as a game then it isn't
going to work.</p>
<p t="4166179" d="3900">If you're going to do this properly, what
you do is you watch and then you notice when</p>
<p t="4170079" d="4530">a person does something that actually makes
you feel positively towards them, and then</p>
<p t="4174609" d="1991">you tell them, “You did this.”</p>
<p t="4176600" d="1489">It has to be specific.</p>
<p t="4178089" d="2411">It can't be at the end of the day: “Well,
you were pretty good today.”</p>
<p t="4180500" d="2509">It's like: “No, that's not going to
work, man.”</p>
<p t="4183009" d="2350">You have to notice something they actually
did.</p>
<p t="4185359" d="8250">It's usually something trivial like: “I
really appreciate the fact that you took your</p>
<p t="4193609" d="4211">dirty dinner plate off the table and rinsed
it off and put it in the dishwasher.”</p>
<p t="4197820" d="2910">It's like, you think that's so damn trivial
it's hardly worth commenting on.</p>
<p t="4200730" d="3679">It's like, no no no, it's not at all;
it's exactly the specific thing that you</p>
<p t="4204409" d="3121">comment on if it did in fact make you happy.</p>
<p t="4207530" d="4069">You know, and you can think about that in
behavioural terms.</p>
<p t="4211599" d="6302">You could say if you something to do something
that you like you should tell them when they</p>
<p t="4217901" d="3039">do things that you like so that they what
you like.</p>
<p t="4220940" d="3650">But, of course, that means that you're putting
yourself on the line too, right, because if</p>
<p t="4224590" d="3410">the person knows what you like then they can
withhold it from you so you're not going</p>
<p t="4228000" d="1320">to do that unless you trust them.</p>
<p t="4229320" d="1109">You're really not.</p>
<p t="4230429" d="5040">So, you know, you might be in a relationship—you
might be in a marriage—where never once</p>
<p t="4235469" d="3431">during the whole bloody marriage do you ever
tell the other person what actually makes</p>
<p t="4238900" d="1000">you happy.</p>
<p t="4239900" d="2679">It's like, that's stupid by the way.</p>
<p t="4242579" d="3901">So, like if you want have a really miserable
time of it that's an excellent way to start.</p>
<p t="4246480" d="3790">You could also add to that the presumption
that if they really loved you they'd know</p>
<p t="4250270" d="9340">what you liked, which is also—
Your partner's no smarter than you, generally</p>
<p t="4259610" d="3310">speaking, and you don't have a clue what's
going to make them happy so I don't know</p>
<p t="4262920" d="3259">why you'd expect them to—especially if
they're male—why you'd expect them to</p>
<p t="4266179" d="2911">return the favour.</p>
<p t="4269090" d="1480">So then you teach them, you know.</p>
<p t="4270570" d="1520">Like it'll probably take four years.</p>
<p t="4272090" d="3750">It's like: “I like it when you do this,”
and then, of course, they won't so you might</p>
<p t="4275840" d="1649">have to mention it again in a month.</p>
<p t="4277489" d="3750">You might think, “Well, it's going to
take eighteen months to train this person,</p>
<p t="4281239" d="1000">at least.”</p>
<p t="4282239" d="3471">I mean they're smart; they're smarter
than a dog but not much smarter.</p>
<p t="4285710" d="4300">So you have to use repetition and you have
to be judicious about.</p>
<p t="4290010" d="3830">And if you do that, and the other person is
also doing that to you, and you both know</p>
<p t="4293840" d="3969">that you're doing that, and you're both
trying to make things better, then you're</p>
<p t="4297809" d="3321">going to communicate about it and then with
any luck things will get better.</p>
<p t="4301130" d="5710">But that means you actually have to want things
to get better, and that's part of the problem,</p>
<p t="4306840" d="3960">of course, because not everybody wants things
to get better and there's a part of everyone</p>
<p t="4310800" d="4100">that would be just as happy if they didn't
get better.</p>
<p t="4314900" d="8250">So anyways, Rogers' idea is that if you
communicate properly with the person that</p>
<p t="4323150" d="5460">you're in the relationship with that you
can model proper being, in some sense, and</p>
<p t="4328610" d="1960">that at least you can attempt to model.</p>
<p t="4330570" d="3520">And then as you attempt it you'll get better
and better at it and as you get better at</p>
<p t="4334090" d="1670">it the other person will get better at it.</p>
<p t="4335760" d="1069">And that works too.</p>
<p t="4336829" d="6281">So I had a client who was a very anxious person
so when the person first came to see me they</p>
<p t="4343110" d="7810">couldn't even talk on the phone, and now
they're acting publicly—they're acting</p>
<p t="4350920" d="1420">in public.</p>
<p t="4352340" d="5569">And that's been the consequence of about
seven years of, I would say, Rogerian conversations</p>
<p t="4357909" d="4761">where almost all that I did was listen.</p>
<p t="4362670" d="5639">Now, I don't quite get the unconditional
positive regard thing, although I know why</p>
<p t="4368309" d="5861">Rogers said it, and his idea that arbitrary
conditions of worth can make someone pathological</p>
<p t="4374170" d="2029">are true.</p>
<p t="4376199" d="5921">But I think a more nuanced sense of unconditional
positive regard is what happens as you watch</p>
<p t="4382120" d="4010">the person and they tell you something, and
as they're telling it to you you can see</p>
<p t="4386130" d="2180">a little part of them sort of come alive.</p>
<p t="4388310" d="5260">And that often happens when their face loses
a fair bit of its rigidity and you can see</p>
<p t="4393570" d="3339">more of what they were like when they were
a child sort of peeping through.</p>
<p t="4396909" d="1701">So their face sort of opens up.</p>
<p t="4398610" d="1370">You can think, “Aha!</p>
<p t="4399980" d="1440">That was really good for that person.</p>
<p t="4401420" d="3389">Whatever they've been telling me that they've
been doing, that was right on the right track,”</p>
<p t="4404809" d="4241">and then you could say, “Look, I noticed
when you talked about this, you know, your</p>
<p t="4409050" d="4960">face relaxed, you didn't look as anxious,
you were smiling—and it was genuine smile—for</p>
<p t="4414010" d="3270">like a second or two there it looked like
you were doing well and you were happy.”</p>
<p t="4417280" d="5080">It's like: “Let's do a bunch more of
that,” because you know if you see in somebody</p>
<p t="4422360" d="6310">that they're capable of experiencing that,
then you could help them experience that more,</p>
<p t="4428670" d="3760">and that's the purpose of a long term relationship.</p>
<p t="4432430" d="7990">It's that you have your weaknesses and inadequacies
and you can't think yourself out of them</p>
<p t="4440420" d="3980">by yourself, partly because they color the
way that you think, and so you need somebody</p>
<p t="4444400" d="5330">else to bang yourself up against—to contend
with—so that all the knots in your soul</p>
<p t="4449730" d="1190">can get ironed out.</p>
<p t="4450920" d="3420">And hypothetically you're doing the same
thing for the other person and then both of</p>
<p t="4454340" d="5819">you are on an upwards spiral, and, in some
sense, that's the core theory of Rogerian</p>
<p t="4460159" d="1000">psychotherapy.</p>
<p t="4461159" d="8801">It's like: Genuine, honest communication
can heal people, and genuine dishonest communication</p>
<p t="4469960" d="1700">can make them pathological.</p>
<p t="4471660" d="9229">And in some sense I think Rogers got closer
to the truth—if you inferred Rogers' presupposition,</p>
<p t="4480889" d="5100">that's as close to the truth as any psychotherapist
has got.</p>
<p t="4485989" d="4581">Deceit makes people pathological, and that's
true.</p>
<p t="4490570" d="3620">A lot of—and Jung noticed this as well—a
lot of what you're doing in psychotherapy</p>
<p t="4494190" d="2910">and in any genuine relationship is a moral
endeavour.</p>
<p t="4497100" d="6789">You're trying to make things better, and
if the other person is deceiving themselves,</p>
<p t="4503889" d="4230">or lying, or failing to become aware of things
that they should become aware of, they're</p>
<p t="4508119" d="4440">going to get bent and twisted out of shape
and then they're not going to be congruent</p>
<p t="4512559" d="2491">with their body or the broader world.</p>
<p t="4515050" d="3649">And then they're going to suffer, and then
that will cascade then all sorts of things</p>
<p t="4518699" d="1101">will start to happen.</p>
<p t="4519800" d="5310">And, you know, that's the path to perdition
and an involuntary trip to the underworld.</p>
<p t="4525110" d="6310">When we meet again I think I'll show you
a little clip of Rogerian psychotherapy because</p>
<p t="4531420" d="4799">a woman in the 1950's agreed to be filmed,
which had a dramatic effect on her life by</p>
<p t="4536219" d="1020">the way.</p>
<p t="4537239" d="8021">But it provides a nice real world illustration
of what Rogers is doing when he's trying</p>
<p t="4545260" d="520">to listen to people.</p>
