<p t="32899" d="4111">So today I'm gonna tell you the best three
stories that I know, I think, and, I think</p>
<p t="37010" d="7889">these stories are absolutely, phenomenally
potent, and the reason for that is that I</p>
<p t="44899" d="9041">think they illustrate in an extraordinarily-powerful
way the nature of the processes that led to</p>
<p t="53940" d="4570">the establishment of western democratic ideals.</p>
<p t="58510" d="9990">Mircae Eliade, whose work I rely on substantially,
to make the following argument, has taken</p>
<p t="68500" d="5979">western academic culture to task in a manner
that hasn't fully been revealed yet.</p>
<p t="74479" d="6411">He said that, like all human cultures, the
west is parochial and narrow in its viewpoint,</p>
<p t="80890" d="4420">and although over the last three hundred years
there's been a substantial amount of cross-cultural</p>
<p t="85310" d="5180">intermingling and a potential broadening of
philosophical and religious horizon, that</p>
<p t="90490" d="9420">broadening has not been sufficiently complete;</p>
<p t="99910" d="5269">If we build on the viewpoint that I've been
developing with you over the last few courses</p>
<p t="105179" d="4141">and make the presupposition that religious
modes of thinking are more phenomenological</p>
<p t="109320" d="4960">than they are rational, which means that they
deal more with what you experience, say, than</p>
<p t="114280" d="4720">with the objective world, if we look at archaic
religious stories through that lens, then</p>
<p t="119000" d="5399">they can start to open up, and so, given that,
I want to open up three religious stories</p>
<p t="124399" d="9351">to you today, two in depth, and one only in
passing because we'll return to it later.</p>
<p t="133750" d="8440">I'll start with, Judeo-Christian Myth of
Genesis, and when I say myth, of course, you</p>
<p t="142190" d="3549">all know this already, but when I say myth,
I don't mean untruth, I mean a form of knowledge</p>
<p t="145739" d="4830">that's narrative in structure and predicated
on presumptions that aren't empirical; a</p>
<p t="150569" d="4741">myth describes processes of transformation,
a myth describes them, a myth describes the</p>
<p t="155310" d="3370">process whereby elements of experience come
into being and transform</p>
<p t="158680" d="12580">On Genesis, the fundamental structural elements
of Genesis are the Word of God and chaos,</p>
<p t="171260" d="7009">and the Hebrew words for chaos and waste are
tehom, for chaos, and tohu, for waste, and</p>
<p t="178269" d="5000">tehom in particular, although toho as well,
are very interesting words because you can</p>
<p t="183269" d="5711">track their derivation historically, and sometimes
if you contract the derivation of words historically,</p>
<p t="188980" d="4679">you can get some sense of the culture milieu
out of which the word sprang,</p>
<p t="193659" d="5590">and we know what tyomat means because we have
written records of a story that involves a</p>
<p t="199249" d="5512">character named Tiamat, and Tiamat is a dragon
who lives at the bottom of the ocean; in the</p>
<p t="204761" d="6848">oldest creation myth we have, which is the
Enuma Elish, the Sumerian creation myth, the</p>
<p t="211609" d="13020">Sumeria, Babylon, Acadia, rightly regarded
as the birthplace of modern western civilization.</p>
<p t="224629" d="10321">In Genesis, two processes unite to produce
being, the first of those processes or states</p>
<p t="234950" d="4819">is chaos, represented by taom or tohu.</p>
<p t="239769" d="5661">The second of those processes is logos, and
logos is another word that has an extraordinarily</p>
<p t="245430" d="7770">broad range of meaning; it's generally transcribed
in the Christian tradition as the word, and</p>
<p t="253200" d="4620">it's identified with Christ, which is a
very peculiar identification because it's</p>
<p t="257820" d="5300">the Word of God that creates order out of
chaos and, of course, the Word of God in Genesis</p>
<p t="263120" d="5360">is a phenomena that predates the birth of
Christ infinitely from a classical religious</p>
<p t="268480" d="8260">perspective, so the fact that the two beings
are identified as of great peculiarity and</p>
<p t="276740" d="2540">also of great interest.</p>
<p t="279280" d="6060">The fundamental story of Genesis is something
like this, and it's perhaps the most brilliant</p>
<p t="285340" d="8460">contribution of Judeo-Christian thought to
world history, its total impact is virtually</p>
<p t="293800" d="1970">incalculable.</p>
<p t="295770" d="4920">The idea is this: that chaos can be conceptualized
as something that has an essentially feminine</p>
<p t="300690" d="6580">aspect as a matrix, and a matrix is a structure
from which other structures emerge, and the</p>
<p t="307270" d="5710">story in Genesis makes the hypothesis that
logos, which is the Word of God, a phenomena</p>
<p t="312980" d="9369">associated with speech and communication and
logic, logos: logic, rationality, courage,</p>
<p t="322349" d="6381">exploration, all combined into a single entity
or trait: logos, the combination of logos</p>
<p t="328730" d="4350">and chaos is what brings order into being;
that's what the story in Genesis means;</p>
<p t="333080" d="6880">it's not an empirical description of the
origin of objects, it's a phenomenological</p>
<p t="339960" d="7120">description of the origin of experience,
the idea being that without the piercing glance</p>
<p t="347080" d="8290">of whatever consciousness is, whatever the
background of experience is, the matrix, chaos,</p>
<p t="355370" d="4440">cannot be conceptualized as real; it takes
the interplay between the feminine principle,</p>
<p t="359810" d="6289">chaos, and the masculine principle, logos,
in order to produce being.</p>
<p t="366099" d="4741">Now that's of substantial importance when
you give some consideration to the fact that</p>
<p t="370840" d="10920">immediately in Genesis, after the establishment
of livable order, the deity yahva identifies</p>
<p t="381760" d="5059">the individual human being with logos, right,
made in God's image, that's the essential</p>
<p t="386819" d="5440">characteristic of the human being, and what
that means is that the logos that operates</p>
<p t="392259" d="4310">in human beings, which is this capacity to
make order out of chaos, is identical to the</p>
<p t="396569" d="5241">principle that gives rise to the cosmos from
a mythological perspective, so it partakes</p>
<p t="401810" d="9039">of the deity in a very direct sense insofar
as being itself is dependent on its operation.</p>
<p t="410849" d="6570">Now it's still possible to claim, given
that perspective, that a story with that sort</p>
<p t="417419" d="4930">of structure is superstitious and that it
doesn't bear any relationship to what reality,</p>
<p t="422349" d="4711">what actually constitutes reality, but you
have to understand that that story, old as</p>
<p t="427060" d="5530">it is, is predicated on older stories, and
it's on the ground that those older stories</p>
<p t="432590" d="6380">establish that our entire concept of natural
rights rests, so if you believe that natural</p>
<p t="438970" d="6460">rights have an existence more than merely
arbitrary, the reason you believe that is</p>
<p t="445430" d="3400">because they're predicated, those rights
are predicated on the ideas that are expressed</p>
<p t="448830" d="3700">in these myths,</p>
<p t="452530" d="6509">Okay, so now we're gonna go back in time
to Sumeria, and I'm gonna show you how the</p>
<p t="459039" d="5970">Sumerian creation myth lays itself out, and
not only that, I'm going to describe to</p>
<p t="465009" d="5310">you the direct political implications of the
Enuma Elish, the Sumerian creation myth, because</p>
<p t="470319" d="4891">the political implications of that myth are
well understood because the political structure</p>
<p t="475210" d="5970">of Sumeria was directly associated with the
structure of the myth because the Sumeria</p>
<p t="481180" d="7329">was regarded as the earthly represent of the
highest God in the Mesopotamian Pantheon,</p>
<p t="488509" d="5091">whose name was Marduk, so insofar as you were
emperor, the reason that you were emperor,</p>
<p t="493600" d="6619">and the, this is what gave your sovereignty
legitimacy, right, ‘cause sovereignty has</p>
<p t="500219" d="3280">to have legitimacy otherwise there's constant
revolutions.</p>
<p t="503499" d="4751">What gave sovereignty legitimacy in Mesopotamia
was the identification of the emperor with</p>
<p t="508250" d="3849">Marduk, and that had, that had certain implications
for the emperor, which we'll discuss in</p>
<p t="512099" d="1000">some detail</p>
<p t="513099" d="1761">So the story starts like this.</p>
<p t="514860" d="11870">You've got this Dragon, Tiamat, and Tiamat
is a great primordial beast, who lives at</p>
<p t="526730" d="2160">the bottom of the ocean.</p>
<p t="528890" d="5480">And the ocean is water and water is associated
with the primal element in archaic thinking</p>
<p t="534370" d="2170">and I told you, there's reasons for that
already.</p>
<p t="536540" d="4730">or if you viewed the transformation of deserts
as a consequence of rain, you can understand</p>
<p t="541270" d="4500">why water would be considered the element
that gives life, right, that the element that,</p>
<p t="545770" d="4090">that brings life forth, and we know from an
evolutionary perspective that that's accurate.</p>
<p t="549860" d="4360">And we know that we're 90 per cent water
and so to consider water the primal element</p>
<p t="554220" d="2540">is no trivial conclusion.</p>
<p t="556760" d="5120">No, no less than presuming that the sun is
the ultimate source of light, the ultimate</p>
<p t="561880" d="3250">god, because the sun is the ultimate source
of life as far as earth, as far as we're</p>
<p t="565130" d="2790">concerned on earth, right, because it's
the source of all our energy.</p>
<p t="567920" d="1840">These aren't stupid concepts, all right.</p>
<p t="569760" d="6010">So Tiamat is this horrible creature that lurks
at the bottom of the primal element, all right.</p>
<p t="575770" d="1880">Now she has a husband, Apsu.</p>
<p t="577650" d="3740">Now the Mesopotamian creation myth doesn't
say much about Apsu.</p>
<p t="581390" d="3011">We only know that he's the male consort
of the Dragon of Chaos.</p>
<p t="584401" d="6469">And we know from reading other sources of
mythology that the male consort of the Dragon</p>
<p t="590870" d="4020">of Chaos generally represents either logos
or culture.</p>
<p t="594890" d="5090">So we're gonna make the presupposition in
this particular case that the husband of Chaos</p>
<p t="599980" d="5500">is Order or Culture, okay, and then the Mesopotamians
don't say much about that, that doesn't,</p>
<p t="605480" d="6460">the development of the idea of Apsu or Order
or Culture, doesn't take new force until</p>
<p t="611940" d="2290">the ancient Egyptians and we'll talk about
them today too.</p>
<p t="614230" d="6651">Okay so Tiamat and Apsu are locked into a
kind of sexual embrace according to the Mesopotamian</p>
<p t="620881" d="1099">creation.</p>
<p t="621980" d="1250">What does that mean?</p>
<p t="623230" d="1080">It kinda means two things.</p>
<p t="624310" d="4980">It means that they're not really distinguishable
because they're locked into this embrace</p>
<p t="629290" d="5290">and it also means that they're up to something
creative because the act of sexual congress</p>
<p t="634580" d="7330">in mythology is most usefully, is most frequently
utilized as representation of something creative</p>
<p t="641910" d="6030">or as representation of the probability of
some new form coming to be, right.</p>
<p t="647940" d="1350">All right.</p>
<p t="649290" d="8410">So Apsu and Tiamat are locked into this embrace
in a state that other creation myths describe</p>
<p t="657700" d="8550">as egg-like, the Pre-Cosmogonic egg, their
intermingling gives rise to the initial state</p>
<p t="666250" d="5450">of being according to the Sumerians and the
initial state of being according to the Sumerians</p>
<p t="671700" d="3500">is characterized by the dominion of the elder
gods</p>
<p t="675200" d="8250">These gods, being none too bright, make a
tremendous amount of racket, doing things.</p>
<p t="683450" d="4090">Well what does that mean exactly?</p>
<p t="687540" d="3530">Well it means something like this.</p>
<p t="691070" d="2100">They make a lot of racket and they cause a
lot of trouble.</p>
<p t="693170" d="7240">They make a lot of wind and all of their racket
and trouble and wind and activity rouses Tiamat.</p>
<p t="700410" d="3610">What does that mean?</p>
<p t="704020" d="2840">Well it means if you do things, you get in
trouble.</p>
<p t="706860" d="3460">It means even if you're trying to solve
problems, you get into trouble because the</p>
<p t="710320" d="3980">solution to a problem tend, tends to generate
a whole bunch of new problems, right.</p>
<p t="714300" d="1390">It's like the Hydra.</p>
<p t="715690" d="10310">So what it means is that it's more or less
fated that any form of activity whatsoever</p>
<p t="726000" d="5050">is likely to produce the threat of catastrophe</p>
<p t="731050" d="4440">And of course we're absolutely keenly aware
of that in the modern world because we're</p>
<p t="735490" d="6480">possessed by this sense that all of our frenetic
activity, all of our frenetic motivated activity</p>
<p t="741970" d="32390">is producing alterations in the world order
such that Nature itself is going to </p>
<p t="774360" d="3820">be destroyed and eliminate us, right.</p>
<p t="778180" d="2170">That's classic Sumerian fear.</p>
<p t="780350" d="3040">Nothing's changed in the last 5,000 years.</p>
<p t="783390" d="4670">The Sumerians presumed that once the elder
gods where constructed and started moving</p>
<p t="788060" d="5660">around on the planet, that their activity
their mindless activity, because remember</p>
<p t="793720" d="4580">these aren't well integrated motivational
forces, they're more like primordial beasts,</p>
<p t="798300" d="1000">right.</p>
<p t="799300" d="6290">Their unintegrated activity risks plunging
everything back in Chaos.</p>
<p t="805590" d="4640">Well Tiamat's the representative of Chaos,
this generative Chaos, but so what if the</p>
<p t="810230" d="5260">Sumerians say, “Well the elder gods cause
a lot of racket, they move around the planet</p>
<p t="815490" d="6270">and they upset Tiamat,” and she decides
that enough is enough and she's gonna wipe</p>
<p t="821760" d="1880">them out.</p>
<p t="823640" d="8250">So she's sitting at the bottom of the ocean,
fuming away, as the elder gods go about their</p>
<p t="831890" d="6640">business and then they take one step too many
and they kill Apsu, who's her husband.</p>
<p t="838530" d="4530">Now the Sumerian creation myth doesn't say
much about this, but we know that Apsu is</p>
<p t="843060" d="1780">the male consort of Chaos.</p>
<p t="844840" d="1290">That makes him Order.</p>
<p t="846130" d="4390">So what happens is the elder gods destroy
Order itself.</p>
<p t="850520" d="3410">They destroy Culture itself and as soon as
you destroy Culture, all hell breaks loose</p>
<p t="853930" d="2291">and that's exactly what happens in this
Sumerian creation myth.</p>
<p t="856221" d="7229">So Tiamat emerges, he's gonna wipe everything
out and the world will revert back to its</p>
<p t="863450" d="2600">primordial, non-existent state.</p>
<p t="866050" d="3390">Now the, all the gods get wind of this and
of course they're just terrified because</p>
<p t="869440" d="4940">they know that this thing that gave rise to
them, whatever it is, the matrix of being,</p>
<p t="874380" d="4470">can easily wipe them out at a moment's notice
and so despite the fact that they are transpersonal</p>
<p t="878850" d="5270">and immortal and characterized by a certain
amount of power, in the face of absolute Chaos,</p>
<p t="884120" d="1680">they're insufficient.</p>
<p t="885800" d="6510">Now this occurrence is extending over a protracted
period of time and as the elder gods are threatened,</p>
<p t="892310" d="3510">they're also breeding and mating and producing
new forms.</p>
<p t="895820" d="3790">And they produce a great, great grandson,
whose name is Marduk.</p>
<p t="899610" d="2570">Now Marduk has a lot of very interesting attributes.</p>
<p t="902180" d="4010">So the attributes are described in the Enuma
Elish in the following manner, so this is</p>
<p t="906190" d="5910">what Marduk's father sees when his wife,
Damkina, gives birth to Marduk.</p>
<p t="912100" d="5520">“So when he, who's Marduk's father,
saw his son, he rejoiced, he beamed, his heart</p>
<p t="917620" d="2060">was filled with joy.</p>
<p t="919680" d="4880">He distinguished him and conferred upon him
double equality with the gods.”</p>
<p t="924560" d="4310">Okay, so that's that first indication that
whatever Marduk represents is something that's</p>
<p t="928870" d="3630">elevated beyond the normal status of a primordial
deity.</p>
<p t="932500" d="4430">“So that he was highly exalted and surpassed
them in everything.</p>
<p t="936930" d="5050">Artfully arranged beyond comprehension were
his members, not fit for human understanding,</p>
<p t="941980" d="4330">hard to look upon, four were his eyes, four
were his ears.</p>
<p t="946310" d="2580">When his lips moved, fired blazed forth.</p>
<p t="948890" d="4160">Each of his four ears grew large and likewise,
his eyes, to see everything.</p>
<p t="953050" d="2500">He was exalted among gods.</p>
<p t="955550" d="1380">Surpassing was his form.</p>
<p t="956930" d="1670">His members were gigantic.</p>
<p t="958600" d="1620">He was surpassing in height.</p>
<p t="960220" d="1190">Mariyutu, Mariyutu.”</p>
<p t="961410" d="1510">One of his names.</p>
<p t="962920" d="4210">“Sun of the sun god, the sun god of the
gods.”</p>
<p t="967130" d="1590">Okay.</p>
<p t="968720" d="1510">Complex bit of poetry.</p>
<p t="970230" d="1000">Says a bunch of things.</p>
<p t="971230" d="5940">It says well whatever Marduk is, is the offspring
of the gods.</p>
<p t="977170" d="2810">Whatever Marduk is, is characterized by heightened
awareness.</p>
<p t="979980" d="1000">Right?</p>
<p t="980980" d="2270">Because he has four ears and they're large.</p>
<p t="983250" d="5990">Whatever Marduk is characterized by is the
status that surpasses that of his fathers.</p>
<p t="989240" d="5400">Whatever he's characterized by, is associated
with the power of speech, real power, because</p>
<p t="994640" d="2930">when he speaks, fire spurts forth.</p>
<p t="997570" d="4340">Marduk is also huge, but more importantly,
he's associated in this particular poem</p>
<p t="1001910" d="1510">with the sun.</p>
<p t="1003420" d="1090">Why is that?</p>
<p t="1004510" d="4210">Well the sun dominates consciousness, right,
because we're conscious during the day.</p>
<p t="1008720" d="4060">Most of our brain is visual cortex, so we're
visual creatures.</p>
<p t="1012780" d="3400">So when the sun rises is when the day begins.</p>
<p t="1016180" d="4790">So Marduk is also associated with whatever
deity dominates the day and that's the deity</p>
<p t="1020970" d="1080">of consciousness.</p>
<p t="1022050" d="3840">And there's more to the story of the Sun,
right, because the Sun is also something that</p>
<p t="1025890" d="5679">rises and sets repeatedly and that means that
the deity that dominates consciousness is</p>
<p t="1031569" d="2380">characterized by a cyclical nature.</p>
<p t="1033949" d="1671">That's a Sun myth.</p>
<p t="1035620" d="5179">Sun rises in the morning renewed, as a consequence
of fighting a terrible battle in the night</p>
<p t="1040799" d="3260">with the enemies of everything that's associated
with consciousness.</p>
<p t="1044059" d="6681">A classic solar myth</p>
<p t="1050740" d="5260">So Apsu and Tiamat give rise to the world
of the gods.</p>
<p t="1056000" d="6420">The activity of the world of gods reawakens
Tiamat, she decides to destroy everything,</p>
<p t="1062420" d="4130">but at that moment the gods give birth to
Marduk.</p>
<p t="1066550" d="4580">Now that's a typical motif which is that
the hero's always born at the time of maximal</p>
<p t="1071130" d="3700">crisis and the reason for that is in part,
it's simple.</p>
<p t="1074830" d="5270">Look, if your culture is dealing well with
the forces of the unknown, so that everything</p>
<p t="1080100" d="5670">is static, but, static but productive, so
that problems themselves don't arise, there's</p>
<p t="1085770" d="3060">no reason for the hero, right, there's no
reason to confront the unknown.</p>
<p t="1088830" d="4940">It's only when crisis beckons that the birth
of the hero is necessary.</p>
<p t="1093770" d="4370">Marduk constitutes the birth of the hero.</p>
<p t="1098140" d="3210">and they say, “Look, you know, we're in
real trouble unless someone goes out there</p>
<p t="1101350" d="7250">and confronts Tiamat straight on, she's
gonna wipe everything out, it's a dangerous</p>
<p t="1108600" d="2450">and terrifying job, but somebody has to do
it.</p>
<p t="1111050" d="3710">And Marduk says, “Oh that's no problem
but I got a few rules here and this is the</p>
<p t="1114760" d="5770">first rule, I'm in charge from here on forward.”</p>
<p t="1120530" d="2640">What does that mean exactly?</p>
<p t="1123170" d="8760">Well these archaic stories are polysemus and,
or polysemic in Northrup Frye's terminology</p>
<p t="1131930" d="6100">and what that means is that they can be read
validly at multiple levels of analysis simultaneously.</p>
<p t="1138030" d="5930">And so one thing it means is that if you take
the 2-year-old child who's essentially under</p>
<p t="1143960" d="4180">the Dominion of assorted primordial gods and
goddesses.</p>
<p t="1148140" d="1090">Right?</p>
<p t="1149230" d="9080">Aggression, fear, panic, and according to
Freud, a certain degree of sexual aggression.</p>
<p t="1158310" d="6810">The child moves from motivated state to domination
for motivated state It isn't until the age</p>
<p t="1165120" d="5760">of 3 and 4 when, under the pressure applied
by the social world and as a consequence of</p>
<p t="1170880" d="5420">the maturation of the prefrontal cortex, which
matures throughout childhood and adolescence</p>
<p t="1176300" d="5520">and doesn't reach its final form until perhaps
into the early 20s, all of those fundamental</p>
<p t="1181820" d="5840">motivational forces start taking on a structured
relationship to one another, which is to say</p>
<p t="1187660" d="8730">that once your, as your personality becomes
integrated, a single motive force forward</p>
<p t="1196390" d="4990">has to bring all of these underlying motivational
systems into some sort of harmonious arrangement.</p>
<p t="1201380" d="3000">Okay so let's, let's see what the Sumerians
are doing here.</p>
<p t="1204380" d="2110">Okay, first of all they're, they're doing
psychology.</p>
<p t="1206490" d="5860">They're trying to figure out, given the
dominion of the, the elder gods, the indisputable</p>
<p t="1212350" d="4350">dominion of the elder gods, Instincts, who
should rule?</p>
<p t="1216700" d="1000">Right?</p>
<p t="1217700" d="1430">What should be in charge?</p>
<p t="1219130" d="2610">How do you construct a hierarchy of values?</p>
<p t="1221740" d="6670">And then more complexly, when you integrate
a state, which is what the Mesopotamians did,</p>
<p t="1228410" d="3200">right, the first great civilization, what
does that mean?</p>
<p t="1231610" d="7520">The first time hundreds of tribes were hammered
into some sort of stable, hierarchical order,</p>
<p t="1239130" d="4179">how do you represent that order?</p>
<p t="1243309" d="6691">“So Marduk gets his act together, the gods
all meet in a huge chamber, they elect him</p>
<p t="1250000" d="2570">king and then they prepare him for battle.</p>
<p t="1252570" d="6020">When the gods, the fathers, beheld the power
of his word, they were glad and did homage,</p>
<p t="1258590" d="1510">saying ‘Marduk is king'.</p>
<p t="1260100" d="3750">They bestowed upon him a scepter, a throne
and a royal robe.</p>
<p t="1263850" d="4680">They gave him an irresistable weapon, smiting
the enemy saying, ‘Go and cut off the life</p>
<p t="1268530" d="1000">of Tiamat.</p>
<p t="1269530" d="3730">May the winds carry her blood to out-of-the-way
places.'</p>
<p t="1273260" d="4270">After the gods, his fathers, had determined
the destiny of Marduk, they set him on the</p>
<p t="1277530" d="4410">road, the way to success and attainment.”</p>
<p t="1281940" d="6080">So then he goes to the “heart of darkness”
so to speak and confronts Tiamat, accuses</p>
<p t="1288020" d="3700">her of treachery and challenges her to battle.</p>
<p t="1291720" d="4610">“When Tiamat heard this, she became like
one in a frenzy and lost her reason.</p>
<p t="1296330" d="1850">She cried out loud and furiously.</p>
<p t="1298180" d="3100">To the very roots, her two legs shook back
and forth.</p>
<p t="1301280" d="3890">She recited an incantation, repeatedly casting
her spell.</p>
<p t="1305170" d="2840">As for the gods of battle, they sharpened
their weapons.</p>
<p t="1308010" d="4720">Tiamat and Marduk, the wisest of the gods,
advanced against one another.</p>
<p t="1312730" d="3710">They pressed on into combat and approached
for battle.”</p>
<p t="1316440" d="5160">Okay, well things don't go out so well with
Tiamat from this point forward.</p>
<p t="1321600" d="5390">The first thing that Marduk does is encapsulate
her in a net and I think that's a really</p>
<p t="1326990" d="4430">interesting metaphor because that's essentially
what human beings do when they encounter the</p>
<p t="1331420" d="1000">unknown, right.</p>
<p t="1332420" d="7060">They encapsulate it in an explanatory network,
so it's a way of binding up the, the anomaly,</p>
<p t="1339480" d="4090">or the unknown, and giving it a substantive
form.</p>
<p t="1343570" d="5850">“Then he cuts her into pieces and then he
makes the world out of her pieces.</p>
<p t="1349420" d="6760">In fact one of Marduk's names is ‘He Who
Makes Ingenious Things' as a consequence</p>
<p t="1356180" d="1740">of the combat with Tiamat.”</p>
<p t="1357920" d="5590">Now that's very, very interesting because
what it means is that the Sumerians are presenting</p>
<p t="1363510" d="5760">in metaphorical form the notion that when
the chips are down, the survival of being</p>
<p t="1369270" d="5310">depends on the capacity of whatever Marduk
represents, the solar god, to encounter the</p>
<p t="1374580" d="4750">matrix of being, to cut it into pieces and
to make the world and if you think about in</p>
<p t="1379330" d="2580">those terms, it's a very, very straightforward
story, right.</p>
<p t="1381910" d="4611">It's basically the story of human beings,
fundamentally the story of human beings, because</p>
<p t="1386521" d="6239">we, in the words of a famous evolutionary
psychologist, whose name completely escapes</p>
<p t="1392760" d="2860">me, we occupy the cognitive niche, right.</p>
<p t="1395620" d="8210">Our mode of being is creativity in the face
of the unknown and when Chaos threatens the</p>
<p t="1403830" d="4770">established mode of being, it's necessary
for us to put our creativity into action and</p>
<p t="1408600" d="5590">to carve out new territory as a consequence
of encounter with the unknown.</p>
<p t="1414190" d="1000">Why?</p>
<p t="1415190" d="4330">Well because we can take the world apart with
our hands and put it together in new ways</p>
<p t="1419520" d="4680">and then we can code what we've done verbally
and we can transmit it to another person and</p>
<p t="1424200" d="1530">then they can do the same thing.</p>
<p t="1425730" d="3120">And we're all doing this all the time and
we're all telling each other how we're</p>
<p t="1428850" d="1000">doing it.</p>
<p t="1429850" d="4190">And that's how the embodiment of logos in
the human being, which is precisely equivalent</p>
<p t="1434040" d="4440">to the Sumerian notion of Marduk, that's
precisely how it is that we're constantly</p>
<p t="1438480" d="3900">capable of redeeming the world.</p>
<p t="1442380" d="7630">and that's why you make resolutions at New
Year's because the new you is supposed to</p>
<p t="1450010" d="1630">be born at the new year.</p>
<p t="1451640" d="3460">OK, so what do the
Mesopotamians do at the new year?</p>
<p t="1455100" d="3580">They take their king and they bring him outside
the city.</p>
<p t="1458680" d="5580">Now you have to understand that outside the
city is chaos, right, because these are city</p>
<p t="1464260" d="1440">states.</p>
<p t="1465700" d="5930">When you go outside the dominion of the human,
you're in chaos.</p>
<p t="1471630" d="6090">And then the priest makes the emperor kneel
and takes all his marks of status off him</p>
<p t="1477720" d="6839">so he's reduced to his essence fundamentally,
bereft of his social persona, and then he</p>
<p t="1484559" d="6111">slaps him with a glove and humiliateshim and
the king is forced to recount his sins, right,</p>
<p t="1490670" d="3010">everything he did in the
last year that wasn't up to Marduk standards,</p>
<p t="1493680" d="1000">so to speak.</p>
<p t="1494680" d="3360">And you can see, that'd be a pretty useful
thing to have somebody who's in power do</p>
<p t="1498040" d="5930">on a regular basis, right, because it reminds
them that they're in fact subject to a trans-personal</p>
<p t="1503970" d="5920">structure whose nature isn't precisely evident
but is nonetheless there, which is the case.</p>
<p t="1509890" d="4810">Act like Marduk or all hell will break loose
and demolish your kingdom, which of course</p>
<p t="1514700" d="2560">is true now,
as it was then now.</p>
<p t="1517260" d="7400">So the emperor gets humiliated, he has to
recount his sins, then he's locked up, then</p>
<p t="1524660" d="5280">he
Re-enacts the battle with Tiamat and when</p>
<p t="1529940" d="6661">he emerges victorious, he's locked up with
a ritual prostitute, a hierodule, and they</p>
<p t="1536601" d="1000">mate.</p>
<p t="1537601" d="1000">Why?</p>
<p t="1538601" d="4469">Well, the
Hierodule, the ritual prostitute, represents</p>
<p t="1543070" d="1000">Tiamat.</p>
<p t="1544070" d="2480">Now why the hell
would that be, because Tiamat's a dragon,</p>
<p t="1546550" d="4790">right, a horrible man-eating dragon that lives
at the bottom of the ocean which is to say</p>
<p t="1551340" d="5680">that in any encounter with the
unknown, as difficult traumatic and violent</p>
<p t="1557020" d="5590">as that might be, there's also the possibility
for something creative to emerge as a consequence,</p>
<p t="1562610" d="6510">right, because it's out of the
unknown that we mine new information</p>
<p t="1569120" d="6060">So insofar as the Mesopotamian emperor acted
out the role of Marduk, then he was a good</p>
<p t="1575180" d="5360">emperor, then he deserved his sovereignty
and literally as well as figuratively, insofar</p>
<p t="1580540" d="4130">as he did play that role, then the society
was going to remain not only stable but constantly</p>
<p t="1584670" d="6940">updated because he's engaged in this constant
creative contact with the unknown, aided and</p>
<p t="1591610" d="5730">abetted by his attempts to remember his own
inadequacies and weaknesses and to do something</p>
<p t="1597340" d="1000">about them.</p>
<p t="1598340" d="3570">OK, so that's a pretty interesting story
and it gets even more interesting when you</p>
<p t="1601910" d="6290">start to understand that the Judao-Christian
myth is assimilated to the Sumerian creation</p>
<p t="1608200" d="4430">myth by the union of the notions of chaos
and Tiamat.</p>
<p t="1612630" d="4540">So the logos in Judao-Christian thinking,
the word of God that produces order out of</p>
<p t="1617170" d="6100">chaos, is also essentially equivalent – at
least metaphorically speaking – to whatever</p>
<p t="1623270" d="3200">Marduk represents in the Sumerian creation
myth.</p>
<p t="1626470" d="4610">And we know that I mean our relationship with
the Enuma Elish is obscured by time but our</p>
<p t="1631080" d="4650">relationship with the stories that lay out
the fundamental sub-structure of western culture</p>
<p t="1635730" d="4120">is not so ameliorated even though we may not
believe them explicitly anymore.</p>
<p t="1639850" d="2220">They still sit at the basis of our society.</p>
