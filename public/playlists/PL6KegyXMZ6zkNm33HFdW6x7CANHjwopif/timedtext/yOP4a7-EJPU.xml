<p t="32020" d="7480">We know that the snake is utilized conceptually
and metaphorically as representation of transformation,</p>
<p t="39500" d="4430">right because the snake is something that
can shed its skin and be reborn.</p>
<p t="43930" d="4780">We know that a snake is something that's
innately attractive and terrifying to human</p>
<p t="48710" d="5930">beings and other primates so that if you come
across a snake, you're likely to be at least</p>
<p t="54640" d="5360">startled, if not horrified by it but also
attracted to it in a way that is underneath</p>
<p t="60000" d="3830">your voluntary consciousness,
right, because snakes attract orienting reflexes</p>
<p t="63830" d="5090">and they activate the systems underneath your
consciousness that actually govern the structure</p>
<p t="68920" d="1990">of that consciousness.</p>
<p t="70910" d="6020">We know that the snake can be well represented
as well as internal chaos so imagine this.</p>
<p t="76930" d="5700">Imagine that it's not unreasonable for a
self-conscious mind searching for a mode of</p>
<p t="82630" d="5330">self-representation to remark on the parallels
between the structure of the snake and the</p>
<p t="87960" d="5260">spine and the brain given that a snake is
essentially a spine with a brain and then</p>
<p t="93220" d="6060">imagine as well that the most archaic aspects
of our nervous system, those that govern novelty</p>
<p t="99280" d="5100">and orienting and anxiety responses or in
fact precisely those that were described by</p>
<p t="104380" d="6510">McLean as nested inside the reptilian brain
and then imagine along with the Hindu Yogis</p>
<p t="110890" d="5530">that the purpose of Kundalini Yoga is to activate
the circuitry that's associated with that</p>
<p t="116420" d="6360">snake so-to-speak, to produce a permanent
state of alert wakefulness that's associated</p>
<p t="122780" d="5800">with consciousness.</p>
<p t="128580" d="1300">So imagine this.</p>
<p t="129880" d="6890">Imagine an animal like, like a zebra, grazing
mindlessly in the herd with no consciousness</p>
<p t="136770" d="1000">whatsoever.</p>
<p t="137770" d="5540">And then imagine its relatively undeveloped
cortical structures activated suddenly by</p>
<p t="143310" d="3860">the movement of a lion off in the perimeter.</p>
<p t="147170" d="4180">And then imagine for that brief
moment, that that zebra's actually conscious,</p>
<p t="151350" d="3550">a state that requires a tremendous amount
of energy and difficult to maintain,</p>
<p t="154900" d="6430">but because the threat and the uncertainty
manifests itself within the Zebra's mode</p>
<p t="161330" d="2710">of consciousness it wakes momentarily.</p>
<p t="164040" d="4990">And then imagine that human beings are like
that zebra, always.</p>
<p t="169030" d="4510">Because we've become so conscious, because
we note that the unknown is around us all</p>
<p t="173540" d="4070">the time, even when we think we're safe,
we're never safe.</p>
<p t="177610" d="4090">Imagine that the reason we're so conscious
is because as a consequence of our discovery</p>
<p t="181700" d="5770">of the possibility of our own mortality, all
this underlying circuitry that in other animals</p>
<p t="187470" d="5030">is only apparent when they're startled or
afraid or interested or curious.</p>
<p t="192500" d="3120">In human beings it's on all the time and
that's what makes us conscious</p>
<p t="195620" d="5860">and the reason for that is because we developed
enough cortical elaboration to note that we're</p>
<p t="201480" d="2760">always threatened by everything that's around
us.</p>
<p t="204240" d="4660">And then imagine that – well that's pretty
awful isn't it? because it's at the basis</p>
<p t="208900" d="5520">of all our innate existential terror – but
then imagine as well that without that terror</p>
<p t="214420" d="6150">pushing us forward and and our constant reference
to the dangerous aspect of the unknown, we</p>
<p t="220570" d="4640">would have never been motivated to produce
the kind of societies that we've produced</p>
<p t="225210" d="7660">which are essentially very remarkably elaborated
devices that enable us to find some protection</p>
<p t="232870" d="4050">from that unknown and to manipulate it effectively.</p>
<p t="236920" d="5250">And then remembering that story, we'll return
to Genesis.</p>
<p t="242170" d="8040">Jung says the snake was regarded by early
Gnostic Christians as a kind of deity whose</p>
<p t="250210" d="4770">faculties were more developed and advanced
than the original Deity that actually structured</p>
<p t="254980" d="1000">the world,</p>
<p t="255980" d="4700">the idea there being that the world initially
was a pretty abysmal place.</p>
<p t="260680" d="1489">Everyone wasn't conscious.</p>
<p t="262169" d="5810">We all existed at the level of the animal
and then the snake came along and said, “wake</p>
<p t="267979" d="1621">up, wake up”.</p>
<p t="269600" d="6620">And the movement from that state of unselfconsciousness
paradise to this profane state of awakening</p>
<p t="276220" d="6130">can be regarded not so much as a descent but
as an ascent of sorts even though a painful</p>
<p t="282350" d="1300">one.</p>
<p t="283650" d="7690">And then you have Goethe's commentary from
Mephistopheles, his representation of Satan</p>
<p t="291340" d="2770">and his capacity for temptation who says:</p>
<p t="294110" d="5869">";follow the adage of my cousin snake/ from
Dreams of Godlike knowledge you will wake</p>
<p t="299979" d="3370">/ to fear in which your very soul shall quake.";</p>
<p t="303349" d="9350">A statement associateing the human tendency
to attribute to all revolutionary sources</p>
<p t="312699" d="4541">of new information a kind of demonic being.</p>
<p t="317240" d="3120">And then you have the problem of the woman.</p>
<p t="320360" d="5210">Now we know that within the context of the
Judeo-Christian tradition women have unduly</p>
<p t="325570" d="7159">suffered for their role in tempting humanity
in the embodied form of Adam towards higher</p>
<p t="332729" d="3440">order self consciousness
and then you think well, let's just take</p>
<p t="336169" d="5120">a look at how human beings and their mating
relationships differ from those of other animals</p>
<p t="341289" d="3720">like chimpanzees to whom we are very closely
genetically related.</p>
<p t="345009" d="4460">And if you look at the mating strategies of
female chimpanzees you see that they really</p>
<p t="349469" d="3301">don't care who they sleep with, so to speak.</p>
<p t="352770" d="1889">Any old chimpanzee will do.</p>
<p t="354659" d="5220">Now, the less dominant male chimps tend to
be chased away by the more dominant male chimps</p>
<p t="359879" d="4641">but if a female and less dominant chimp can
get the hell away from the watchful gaze of</p>
<p t="364520" d="3340">the dominants already, they're perfectly
happy to mate.</p>
<p t="367860" d="2250">Human females are not like that.</p>
<p t="370110" d="2170">They're selective maters.</p>
<p t="372280" d="4759">And there's a tremendous body of evolutionary
psychological information that suggests that</p>
<p t="377039" d="7831">although both genders value intelligence and
physical appearance, females value the ability</p>
<p t="384870" d="7740">to attain dominance hierarchy status in men
far more than men admire the ability to attain</p>
<p t="392610" d="1519">dominant status in women.</p>
<p t="394129" d="5400">which is to say that men don't care what
a woman has with regards to potential for</p>
<p t="399529" d="5450">attaining status, whereas with women it's
one of the strong determinants of mating preference.</p>
<p t="404979" d="4960">So then let's say look we don't know why
the hell our cortexes expanded so rapidly</p>
<p t="409939" d="2730">somewhere between five and three million years
ago.</p>
<p t="412669" d="2451">Let's offer this as a hypothesis.</p>
<p t="415120" d="3949">The women started to get choosy and because
they were so damned complicated the whole</p>
<p t="419069" d="6891">human species had to exaggerate its cortical
growth prior to any even use for that cortical</p>
<p t="425960" d="4919">growth just so that the men had an even hand
in the competition, right.</p>
<p t="430879" d="5650">So women put tremendous selection pressure
on the human being to develop tremendous,</p>
<p t="436529" d="1961">tremendous cortical expansion.</p>
<p t="438490" d="5340">Now, we already know that from the mythological
perspective that women are frequently cast</p>
<p t="443830" d="6519">into the same conceptual domain - the temptress
domain - as the benevolent aspect of the unknown</p>
<p t="450349" d="4630">and we know as well from representations of
hero mythology that it is the individual who</p>
<p t="454979" d="5280">goes out to confront chaos whose most likely
to free from the dragon not only treasure</p>
<p t="460259" d="5780">but a virgin say in the case of mythological
representations like say George and the Dragon.</p>
<p t="466039" d="7481">So then we close with the notion of voluntarism
and in the Old Testament in Genesis, there's</p>
<p t="473520" d="4950">now there's this notion that not only did
people become self-conscious because they</p>
<p t="478470" d="2800">did something but they did this voluntarily
right?</p>
<p t="481270" d="6590">They they they made this decision on their
own.</p>
<p t="487860" d="8850">So Milton puts words into God's mouth and
says, ";So will fall/ He and his faithless</p>
<p t="496710" d="2370">progeny: whose fault?</p>
<p t="499080" d="1170">/ Whose but his own?</p>
<p t="500250" d="5659">/ ingrate, he had of me/ All he could have;
I made him just and right,/ sufficient to</p>
<p t="505909" d="4171">have stood, though free to fall.”
and then you think if you think well maybe</p>
<p t="510080" d="6149">the notion of the heritable sin of Adam characterizing
human beings and their fallen existential</p>
<p t="516229" d="5241">condition isn't just the black-hearted ravings
of fundamentalist southern Baptist lunatics.</p>
<p t="521470" d="1000">Right?</p>
<p t="522470" d="1560">There's something to this.</p>
<p t="524030" d="4499">Human beings are the only creatures that seem
to live at odds with their own experience</p>
<p t="528529" d="4931">and it's not so unreasonable to suppose
that it's our dawning capacity for self</p>
<p t="533460" d="3970">consciousness that put us in that uncomfortable
position.</p>
<p t="537430" d="4580">So why do I associate the eating of the apple
with self consciousness?</p>
<p t="542010" d="3010">Well, it's because that's how the story
lays itself out.</p>
<p t="545020" d="4390">You have the collateral evidence of the Buddhist
story of enlightenment, right?</p>
<p t="549410" d="1320">His contact with death.</p>
<p t="550730" d="7060">You have multiple medie, medieval representations
of Eve offering to animal, to Adam not an</p>
<p t="557790" d="2200">apple but a skull.</p>
<p t="559990" d="4170">You have multiple representations of the tree
of the knowledge of good and evil in the medieval</p>
<p t="564160" d="4610">iconography as not containing apples but containing
skulls.</p>
<p t="568770" d="5670">And you have the the statements that are within
the context of Genesis itself.</p>
<p t="574440" d="4620">";And the eyes of both of them were opened.</p>
<p t="579060" d="1720">And they knew that they were naked.</p>
<p t="580780" d="3300">And they sewed fig leaves together and made
themselves aprons.</p>
<p t="584080" d="3990">Well, there's a lot of information packed
into those two lines, right?</p>
<p t="588070" d="1680">What does it mean to have your eyes open?</p>
<p t="589750" d="6000">Well half your brain is visual cortex. it's
not unreasonable to presume that that means</p>
<p t="595750" d="5370">that quick, a quick magnification of consciousness.</p>
<p t="601120" d="1470">You're conscious during the day.</p>
<p t="602590" d="1150">That's when your eyes are open.</p>
<p t="603740" d="2160">But what happens when your eyes are open?</p>
<p t="605900" d="1330">Well, you know you're naked.</p>
<p t="607230" d="1140">Well what does that mean?</p>
<p t="608370" d="4670">Well, you know you're vulnerable, right
to social comment, to social judgment, to</p>
<p t="613040" d="4170">dominance, hierarchy, status manoeuvering
and to all the terrible things that the unknown</p>
<p t="617210" d="3350">world can can heap upon you.</p>
<p t="620560" d="1730">And so then what do you do?</p>
<p t="622290" d="1580">Well you create culture.</p>
<p t="623870" d="1000">Right?</p>
<p t="624870" d="1500">And that's what this little sentence said.</p>
<p t="626370" d="3280">";And they sewed fig leaves together and made
themselves aprons.";</p>
<p t="629650" d="9530">That's a pretty eventful sequence all crammed
up in two little sentences.</p>
<p t="639180" d="1030">So then what happens?</p>
<p t="640210" d="3290">Ah I think it's extremely interesting.</p>
<p t="643500" d="4060">So before Adam and Eve figure out that they're
naked, they're cruising around the garden</p>
<p t="647560" d="1990">having a fine time doing whatever they want.</p>
<p t="649550" d="1960">They don't take any thought for the future,
right?</p>
<p t="651510" d="1820">They don't have a pre frontal cortex.</p>
<p t="653330" d="7140">They're living in a, in a paradox-less environment
like an animal lives.</p>
<p t="660470" d="3100">Well what happens after they become self conscious?</p>
<p t="663570" d="3930">Well, prior to this Adam's walking around
with God right?</p>
<p t="667500" d="1120">And you think about what that means.</p>
<p t="668620" d="1870">Does it mean something like this?</p>
<p t="670490" d="2850">An animal isn't in the world of good and
evil.</p>
<p t="673340" d="3180">An animal like Nietzsche points out is beyond
good and evil, right?</p>
<p t="676520" d="6230">Enraptured in te, entirely by the actions
of automatic instinct, governed by processes</p>
<p t="682750" d="2280">that are completely transcendent.</p>
<p t="685030" d="2600">The animal's nothing but a force of nature.</p>
<p t="687630" d="2711">There's no opposition between the animal
and the world.</p>
<p t="690341" d="2689">The animal is the world.</p>
<p t="693030" d="5650">And just as in the case of the animal prior
to the eating of the apple, Adam walks around</p>
<p t="698680" d="1370">the garden with God.</p>
<p t="700050" d="7370">There's no discontinuity between Him and
the, and the transcendent world as such but</p>
<p t="707420" d="4120">as soon as he becomes naked, he hides.</p>
<p t="711540" d="1170">Well why?</p>
<p t="712710" d="1460">Well that doesn't need to be answered.</p>
<p t="714170" d="2120">All you have to do is think about it.</p>
<p t="716290" d="2700">Why would you hide if you know you're naked?</p>
<p t="718990" d="1500">Well, it's simple.</p>
<p t="720490" d="2610">You hide because you think you can get hurt.</p>
<p t="723100" d="6610">You think that whatever you are is so vulnerable
that if it shows itself to the transcendent</p>
<p t="729710" d="5470">to others, to the natural road that something
terrible will happen and then you think well</p>
<p t="735180" d="3450">that's a pretty logical pre-supposition
right?</p>
<p t="738630" d="4260">Look at us.</p>
<p t="742890" d="7170">So God comes cruising around the garden after
Adam and Eve eat the apple in the cool of</p>
<p t="750060" d="5170">the day, and Adam and Eve hide themselves
among the trees of the garden.</p>
<p t="755230" d="5140">And God says, hey Adam hey, where are you?</p>
<p t="760370" d="6960">And Adam says, “I heard your voice and I
was afraid because I was naked and I hid myself”.</p>
<p t="767330" d="6910">And that story has bottomless depth because
it means something like this.</p>
<p t="774240" d="4260">At the beginning of Genesis, there's this
notion that there is a transcendent relationship</p>
<p t="778500" d="2050">between the individual and God, right?</p>
<p t="780550" d="3230">The identity of logos and the individual right?</p>
<p t="783780" d="6520">A notion by the way that our entire idea of
intrinsic human right is predicated on as</p>
<p t="790300" d="2510">we've been at some pains to demonstrate.</p>
<p t="792810" d="7780">A relationship between the limited and the
limitless eradicated by the dawn of self-consciousness.</p>
<p t="800590" d="1060">Well what does that mean?</p>
<p t="801650" d="3440">Well, let's say you have a destiny just
for the sake of argument.</p>
<p t="805090" d="1000">Right?</p>
<p t="806090" d="4610">Because you are a being with a tremendous
history and an unbelievable potential.</p>
<p t="810700" d="2920">So let's say you have a destiny, just for
the sake of argument.</p>
<p t="813620" d="4050">What would cause you to hide from that destiny?</p>
<p t="817670" d="6330">Well, obviously your own reflection's on
your mortal vulnerability, right?</p>
<p t="824000" d="9110">How could I be characterized by any transcendent
power whatsoever when I'm susceptible to</p>
<p t="833110" d="1790">social alienation, right?</p>
<p t="834900" d="6500">When I have this body which is capable of
terrifying degeneration that will eventually</p>
<p t="841400" d="3440">decay into old age and that is bounded by
death.</p>
<p t="844840" d="6810">How could I be good for anything which is
precisely what this little story says.</p>
<p t="851650" d="5120">And so God figures out that Adam and Eve at
the fruit and that's pretty decisive move</p>
<p t="856770" d="3180">because once you wake up, sorry, you're
awake.</p>
<p t="859950" d="4110">And he says, and this is not an injunction
by the way.</p>
<p t="864060" d="1210">This is the description.</p>
<p t="865270" d="2290">All right, you've done it now.</p>
<p t="867560" d="4530">“And to the woman he says, I will greatly
multiply thy sorrow and thy conception.</p>
<p t="872090" d="2360">In sorry shalt thou bring forth children.";</p>
<p t="874450" d="1000">Why?</p>
<p t="875450" d="1000">Why?</p>
<p t="876450" d="4740">Well, we have a big cortex, right?</p>
<p t="881190" d="1000">Really big.</p>
<p t="882190" d="4830">It grew fast and what that meant is that there
was an evolutionary arms race between skull</p>
<p t="887020" d="7230">size, date of birth, and pelvic diameter girth.</p>
<p t="894250" d="4750">The wider the pelvis, the less effectively
you can walk.</p>
<p t="899000" d="2860">The larger the skull, the bigger the brain.</p>
<p t="901860" d="3680">The younger the baby, the more dependent and
vulnerable.</p>
<p t="905540" d="2750">So what do we have in the case of human beings?</p>
<p t="908290" d="5150">The female human pelvis has already stretched
to the limits of its structural capacity.</p>
<p t="913440" d="4960">So the hole in its center is as big as it
can get without compromising the structural</p>
<p t="918400" d="4910">integrity of the pelvis while still allowing
women to walk and run.</p>
<p t="923310" d="2090">So how have babies adapted to that?</p>
<p t="925400" d="1030">Well that's simple.</p>
<p t="926430" d="3840">A mammal of our size should have a gestation
period of two years.</p>
<p t="930270" d="1920">We have a gestation period of nine months.</p>
<p t="932190" d="1000">Why?</p>
<p t="933190" d="2890">You gotta get the damned baby out before its
head gets too big.</p>
<p t="936080" d="1070">What does that mean?</p>
<p t="937150" d="1780">Well, means it's vulnerable, right?</p>
<p t="938930" d="4630">Nothing more vulnerable than a baby human
being except maybe a baby kangaroo, right?</p>
<p t="943560" d="2310">But it's got a pouch to hide in at least.</p>
<p t="945870" d="2050">So we're born vulnerable, right?</p>
<p t="947920" d="1890">Characteristic of the birth of the hero.</p>
<p t="949810" d="1800">Who suffers in childbirth?</p>
<p t="951610" d="1000">Women.</p>
<p t="952610" d="1000">Why?</p>
<p t="953610" d="1840">Baby skulls just a little bit too big.</p>
<p t="955450" d="3190">Has to be crunched and compacted during birth,
right?</p>
<p t="958640" d="4090">The skull bones aren't joined together so
that the baby's head can be squashed and</p>
<p t="962730" d="2960">visibly deformed during the process of birth.</p>
<p t="965690" d="3920">Prior to the twentieth century, what was the
death rate among women giving birth?</p>
<p t="969610" d="1000">One in three?</p>
<p t="970610" d="1360">One in five?</p>
<p t="971970" d="1000">Terrible.</p>
<p t="972970" d="1000">Why?</p>
<p t="973970" d="2400">That's the price you pay for self consciousness.</p>
<p t="976370" d="5030">";And thy desire shall be to thy husband and
he shall rule over thee.";</p>
<p t="981400" d="1629">This is not an injunction.</p>
<p t="983029" d="3661">This is a description.</p>
<p t="986690" d="5089">The additional burden that dependent offspring
place on women, place them at a disadvantage.</p>
<p t="991779" d="3131">What's the consequence of that from a historical
perspective?</p>
<p t="994910" d="3440">Well, any feminist can answer that question
right.</p>
<p t="998350" d="7179">";And unto Adam, he said, because you listen
to your wife, and have eaten the tree, of</p>
<p t="1005529" d="3921">which I commanded thee saying don't eat
that, cursed is the ground for thy sake.</p>
<p t="1009450" d="2600">In sorrow shall thou eat of it for all the
days of thy life.";</p>
<p t="1012050" d="1490">Fair enough, right?</p>
<p t="1013540" d="2660">Once you're self-conscious you work.</p>
<p t="1016200" d="1000">Why?</p>
<p t="1017200" d="1000">Well animals don't work.</p>
<p t="1018200" d="1000">Why do people work?</p>
<p t="1019200" d="1860">Well, because we know, right?</p>
<p t="1021060" d="2020">We know that if it isn't going to happen
today, it's going to happen tomorrow.</p>
<p t="1023080" d="4550">And if it isn't going to happen tomorrow,
well it's going to happen next week or the</p>
<p t="1027630" d="2510">week after or the month after the year after.</p>
<p t="1030140" d="2010">And we bloody well better prepare.</p>
<p t="1032150" d="2830">So that's what we do, constantly.</p>
<p t="1034980" d="1880">Prepare and prepare and prepare.</p>
<p t="1036860" d="4839">So we're not bounded and motivated by what's
happening from second to second.</p>
<p t="1041699" d="2661">Like the animal is in its still paradisal
state.</p>
<p t="1044360" d="4810">We're constantly tormented by an endless
string of what if questions because when we</p>
<p t="1049170" d="5780">look at the unknown, we can see the possibility
for everything including our own punishment,</p>
<p t="1054950" d="6140">our own torment, our own demise and so we're
motivated like no other animal to work.</p>
<p t="1061090" d="1020">And so we work.</p>
<p t="1062110" d="4480">But that is another aspect that alienates
from paradisal being.</p>
<p t="1066590" d="4800">";Thorn and thistles shall it bring forth for
thee and now shall eat the herb of the field,</p>
<p t="1071390" d="4290">in the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread
till thou return unto the ground, for dust</p>
<p t="1075680" d="2930">thou art and unto dust shalt thou return.</p>
<p t="1078610" d="1160">Right.</p>
<p t="1079770" d="3970">Therefore the Lord God sent Him forth from
the Garden of Eden to till the ground from</p>
<p t="1083740" d="1880">whence he was taken.</p>
<p t="1085620" d="3770">So he drove out the man and he placed to the
east of the Garden of Eden cherubims and a</p>
<p t="1089390" d="4419">flaming sword which turned every way to keep
the way of the Tree of Life.";</p>
<p t="1093809" d="8231">Adam and Eve, right?</p>
<p t="1102040" d="1980">The Mother and Father of all humanity.</p>
<p t="1104020" d="4731">So you can give them a mythological slant
and you can say Adam is culture, say and Eve</p>
<p t="1108751" d="2519">is nature because they're the archetypal
parents.</p>
<p t="1111270" d="2220">It's a perfectly reasonable interpretation.</p>
<p t="1113490" d="3530">They have twin sons, Cain and Abel.</p>
<p t="1117020" d="6600">So let's read first born creatures, first
born human creatures in the new self conscious</p>
<p t="1123620" d="1000">world.</p>
<p t="1124620" d="5230">So what are the first two individuals in the
new self-conscious world like and let's</p>
<p t="1129850" d="1000">find out.</p>
<p t="1130850" d="4360">";And Adam knew Eve his wife and she conceived
and bearer of Cain and said, I have gotten</p>
<p t="1135210" d="2040">a man from the Lord.</p>
<p t="1137250" d="3270">And again she beared his brother Abel, the
younger brother.</p>
<p t="1140520" d="3390">And Abel was a keeper of sheep but Cain was
a tiller of the ground.</p>
<p t="1143910" d="4390">And in the process at time it came to pass
that Cain brought of the fruit of the ground</p>
<p t="1148300" d="1550">an offering unto the Lord.";</p>
<p t="1149850" d="1000">Okay.</p>
<p t="1150850" d="6310">So, we're going to remove this from its
- this story - from its entrapment in a particular</p>
<p t="1157160" d="3232">temporal domain and within a temporal culture.</p>
<p t="1160392" d="1108">We're going to say something like this.</p>
<p t="1161500" d="3559">Well, if you work you make sacrifices right?</p>
<p t="1165059" d="1611">That's what work's all about.</p>
<p t="1166670" d="4590">And the reason you make sacrifices is because
you're offering up to the unknown the fruits</p>
<p t="1171260" d="4580">of your labour in the hope that as a consequence
of your diligent effort, you're going to</p>
<p t="1175840" d="2100">be favoured, right because otherwise why work?</p>
<p t="1177940" d="4460">The point of working is to transform the transcendent
into something benevolent.</p>
<p t="1182400" d="3410">So you work and you work and you work and
you say, is that sufficient?</p>
<p t="1185810" d="4150">And the answer you get from the transcendent
is the answer.</p>
<p t="1189960" d="4810">Now it's certainly true that lots of people
work and it doesn't go all that well, right?</p>
<p t="1194770" d="4270">They make sacrifices and they do what they
think they have to do and their life is one</p>
<p t="1199040" d="1800">string of catastrophes after another.</p>
<p t="1200840" d="1000">All right?</p>
<p t="1201840" d="1020">So we have this situation.</p>
<p t="1202860" d="4240">";In the process of time it came to pass that
Cain brought of the fruit of the ground an</p>
<p t="1207100" d="1570">offering unto the Lord.</p>
<p t="1208670" d="5260">And Abel, he also brought of the firstlings
of his flock, and of the fat thereof.</p>
<p t="1213930" d="3310">And the Lord had respect unto Abel and his
offering.";</p>
<p t="1217240" d="4010">So what that means is that old Abel, working
away, may have things that are going great</p>
<p t="1221250" d="1060">for him right?</p>
<p t="1222310" d="1000">Fortune smiles on him.</p>
<p t="1223310" d="1710">He's doing wonderfully.</p>
<p t="1225020" d="2060">He's got everything he needs.</p>
<p t="1227080" d="4480">Well, okay and he's scrounging away in the
ground and things aren't going as well for</p>
<p t="1231560" d="1230">him at all, right?</p>
<p t="1232790" d="1440">Plagues, locusts, you-name-it.</p>
<p t="1234230" d="1660">Farm life isn't going well.</p>
<p t="1235890" d="1390">So what happens?</p>
<p t="1237280" d="4880">Well, ";Cain was very wrath that his countenance
fell.";</p>
<p t="1242160" d="2399">Well, precisely right?</p>
<p t="1244559" d="7071">Because if you work diligently towards a certain
end and you don't get there then your contenance</p>
<p t="1251630" d="1300">fell, falls, right?</p>
<p t="1252930" d="3910">You're angry, frustrated, disappointed,
hurt, anxious, threatened, ashamed, guilty,</p>
<p t="1256840" d="3010">the whole panoply of negative emotions.</p>
<p t="1259850" d="3670">And that's fair enough because of course
if you fail, that's what's going to be</p>
<p t="1263520" d="2490">the consequence
But then there's this little twist on it?</p>
<p t="1266010" d="1000">Right?</p>
<p t="1267010" d="4049">This specifically human twist that, that's
like that kind of moral of the whole story.</p>
<p t="1271059" d="5941">And so you find the Lord saying, “What,
you know, what's up with you?</p>
<p t="1277000" d="1620">Why are you so unhappy?</p>
<p t="1278620" d="5240">If you just got your act together then you'd
be accepted.</p>
<p t="1283860" d="3870">If you really got your act together”
which is a statement something like this,</p>
<p t="1287730" d="5780">if you keep making sacrifices and the same
terrible thing keeps happening, there's</p>
<p t="1293510" d="4980">always the possibility that you're just
actually not doing it the right way.</p>
<p t="1298490" d="3380">And if you'd just get yourself straightened
up, tapped together, right?</p>
<p t="1301870" d="4670">And drop the preconceptions that you don't
really need, and adjust your behaviour accordingly,</p>
<p t="1306540" d="2070">then fortune would smile on you.</p>
<p t="1308610" d="3190">And that's exactly what the Lord says to
Cain, right?</p>
<p t="1311800" d="3610">You don't walk around with such a crabby
look on your face.</p>
<p t="1315410" d="4870">If you did, well, you'll be accepted and
if you don't do well, sin lies at the door.</p>
<p t="1320280" d="1000">So what does that mean?</p>
<p t="1321280" d="5200">Well, this is a deep motif in ancient Hebrew
thinking.</p>
<p t="1326480" d="4370">If the world isn't laying itself out in
a manner that you find acceptable, you're</p>
<p t="1330850" d="1190">faced with a tough choice.</p>
<p t="1332040" d="6310">Either the world is a terrible place, bent
on your destruction or you're doing something</p>
<p t="1338350" d="1000">wrong.</p>
<p t="1339350" d="3480">And it bloody well better be that you're
doing something wrong because if the world</p>
<p t="1342830" d="6410">is a terrible place bent on your destruction,
you've got absolutely no hope.</p>
<p t="1349240" d="6819">“And Cain talked with Abel his brother and
it came to pass, when they were in the field</p>
<p t="1356059" d="3771">that Cain rose up against Abel his brother
and killed him.</p>
<p t="1359830" d="1000">“
So what does that mean?</p>
<p t="1360830" d="1650">Well, it's pretty easy.</p>
<p t="1362480" d="1000">It's simple.</p>
<p t="1363480" d="1000">It means this.</p>
<p t="1364480" d="2470">Well, say things aren't that well for you?</p>
<p t="1366950" d="4720">And it's really not because life's unfair
and everything's stacked against you.</p>
<p t="1371670" d="6900">It's because you're kind of a arrogant,
stubborn, quasi totalitarian, cowardly idiot.</p>
<p t="1378570" d="3800">And as a consequence of that, the world is
turning into something ressembling a wasteland</p>
<p t="1382370" d="1000">around you.</p>
<p t="1383370" d="1680">And you have this auction.</p>
<p t="1385050" d="1000">Change.</p>
<p t="1386050" d="1410">Or continue.</p>
<p t="1387460" d="3870">Oh, you have another option.</p>
<p t="1391330" d="1080">Man look around.</p>
<p t="1392410" d="2530">There's all those people doing well.</p>
<p t="1394940" d="2310">The world's a terrible place bent on my
destruction.</p>
<p t="1397250" d="5380">Couldn't it be just the most interesting
thing if, as things are going to hell for</p>
<p t="1402630" d="6620">me, I could take a long, just for the ride,
some of those successful people who are successful</p>
<p t="1409250" d="1980">just for unfair reasons.</p>
<p t="1411230" d="1120">Anyways, right?</p>
<p t="1412350" d="4410">Instead of using all that negative emotion
as a cue that there's something about me</p>
<p t="1416760" d="7530">that might need to be transformed, I can say
well why not just eradicate the target of</p>
<p t="1424290" d="1310">my resentment?</p>
<p t="1425600" d="1000">Right?</p>
<p t="1426600" d="4170">Not only because that sort of removes the
problem of comparison but more profoundly</p>
<p t="1430770" d="3130">– and I think sort of again – limitlessly,
profoundly.</p>
<p t="1433900" d="5110">Let's say you make the decision that the
world's a terrible place and it's bent</p>
<p t="1439010" d="1490">on your destruction.</p>
<p t="1440500" d="2700">And then you think well what's the logical
response to that?</p>
<p t="1443200" d="4690">And then you think something like this.</p>
<p t="1447890" d="9370">Goethe, Faust, Mephistopheles credo.</p>
<p t="1457260" d="8360">“The spirit I that endlessly denies and
rightly too for all that comes to birth is</p>
<p t="1465620" d="3490">fit for overthrow as nothing worth.</p>
<p t="1469110" d="6650">Wherefore the world were better sterilized
thus all that's here is evil recognized</p>
<p t="1475760" d="7320">is gain to me and downfall, ruin and sin,
the very element I'd prosper in”</p>
<p t="1483080" d="6430">And Goethe draws our attention to this credo,
not once but twice in his writing of Faust</p>
<p t="1489510" d="7200">and has Mephistopheles say right, once again
";go on, to sheer nothing.</p>
<p t="1496710" d="2719">Passed With null made one.</p>
<p t="1499429" d="5111">/ What matters our creative endless toil /when
at a snatch oblivion ends the coil?/ It is</p>
<p t="1504540" d="3250">by gone, how shall this riddle run?</p>
<p t="1507790" d="4259">As good as if things never had begun yet circle
back existence to possess.</p>
<p t="1512049" d="2990">I'd rather have eternal emptiness.</p>
<p t="1515039" d="3421">";
And so then you think about Cain-like figures,</p>
<p t="1518460" d="1640">like Stalin.</p>
<p t="1520100" d="2959">And you think well what exactly was he motivated
by?</p>
<p t="1523059" d="4341">And on the one hand you think well, he was
trying to extend his cultural – dominion,</p>
<p t="1527400" d="9920">plagued by his own self-conscious nuroticism
he wanted to extend the borders of his totalitarian</p>
<p t="1537320" d="6880">certainty to every corner just to not be plagued
by the unknown. and you think fair enough,</p>
<p t="1544200" d="3250">we're all pretty nervous and a little stability
is a pretty good thing.</p>
<p t="1547450" d="1000">Why?</p>
<p t="1548450" d="5550">Because they make a fundamental judgment,
which is the judgement of Mephistopheles.</p>
<p t="1554000" d="2750">Look: life is terrible.</p>
<p t="1556750" d="1000">terrible.</p>
<p t="1557750" d="1000">terrible.</p>
<p t="1558750" d="6559">we're self conscious, we get sick, we go insane,
we're going to die, children, innocent children</p>
<p t="1565309" d="2391">suffer everywhere.</p>
<p t="1567700" d="6210">how in the world is it right to let such a
state continue?</p>
<p t="1573910" d="5970">maybe it will be better, all things considered
to just bring the whole thing to an end.</p>
<p t="1579880" d="6980">and then you think again with Eliade that
the reason human societies fall apart is two</p>
<p t="1586860" d="5220">fold, one is that things go from bad to worse
in their own accord right?</p>
<p t="1592080" d="1910">thermodynamic reality.</p>
<p t="1593990" d="1920">pure entropy.</p>
<p t="1595910" d="3070">structured entities decay.</p>
<p t="1598980" d="6699">but then there's a twist, structured entities
constructed by humans are sped in their process</p>
<p t="1605679" d="5911">of decay by the participants of the individuals
within that society who have essentnially</p>
<p t="1611590" d="8200">decided that the game is not worth the price
and that under such conditions the only reasonable</p>
<p t="1619790" d="6009">thing for a self conscious - painfully self
conscious - individual to do is to work as</p>
<p t="1625799" d="6361">hard as he or she possibly can to take the
maximum amount of revenge on the conditions</p>
<p t="1632160" d="6560">of existence and to ensure that the entire
game folds up and that consciousness disapears</p>
<p t="1638720" d="28360">and that being is eradicated.</p>
