<p t="20050" d="7780">Well, I'm speaking today with Dr. Stephen
Hicks, who is a professor of philosophy in</p>
<p t="27830" d="6560">the Department of Philosophy at Rockford University
in Illinois. Professor Hicks has written a</p>
<p t="34390" d="5620">book—he's written several books—but
he's written one in particular that I wanted</p>
<p t="40010" d="5920">to talk to him about today called Explaining
Postmodernism: Skepticism and Socialism from</p>
<p t="45930" d="6379">Rousseau to Foucault, which was published
a fair while ago now, in 2004, but I think</p>
<p t="52309" d="4340">has become even more pertinent and relevant
today.</p>
<p t="56649" d="6050">I have talked a lot to my viewers about your
book, and so let's talk about Postmodernism</p>
<p t="62699" d="8121">and its relationship with Neo-Marxism. So
maybe you could tell the viewers here a little</p>
<p t="70820" d="3040">more about yourself and how you got interested
in this.</p>
<p t="73860" d="7610">Well, I finished graduate school in philosophy
in the early 90s, originally from Canada,</p>
<p t="81470" d="6170">born in Toronto. At that point Pittsburgh
and Indiana had the two strongest philosophy</p>
<p t="87640" d="3259">of science and logic programs, and that's
what I was interested in at the time. And</p>
<p t="90899" d="5071">so upon a professor's recommendation, I
ended up at Indiana, and it worked out very</p>
<p t="95970" d="1800">nicely for me.</p>
<p t="97770" d="5320">So most of my graduate work was actually in
epistemology, philosophy of science, logic,</p>
<p t="103090" d="6820">some cognitive science issues as well. So
a lot of the epistemological and philosophical/linguistic</p>
<p t="109910" d="6290">issues that come up in Postmodernism—the
groundwork so to speak was laid for that.</p>
<p t="116200" d="6680">When I finished grad school and started teaching
full-time, came to Rockford University. I</p>
<p t="122880" d="3960">was teaching in an honors program, and the
way that program worked was—it was essentially</p>
<p t="126840" d="4990">a Great Books program—and so it was like
getting a second education, wonderfully. But</p>
<p t="131830" d="5870">the way it was done was that each course was
taught by two professors to our honor students.</p>
<p t="137700" d="5810">So the professors would be from different
departments, so I was paired with literature</p>
<p t="143510" d="4660">professors, history professors, and so on.
And this was now the middle of the 90s.</p>
<p t="148170" d="5270">I started to hear about thinkers I had not
read. I'd kind-of heard about them, but</p>
<p t="153440" d="6100">now I was reading them more closely and finding
that in history and literature and sociology</p>
<p t="159540" d="7700">and anthropology, names like Derrida and Foucault
and the others, if not omnipresent, were huge</p>
<p t="167240" d="8790">names. So I realized I had a gap in my education
to fill. So I started reading deeply in them.</p>
<p t="176030" d="6840">My education in some ways was broad in the
history of philosophy but narrow at the graduate</p>
<p t="182870" d="5400">school level and I had focused mostly on Anglo-American
philosophy, so my understanding of the Continental</p>
<p t="188270" d="7160">traditions was quite limited. But by the time
I got to the end of the 90s, I realized there</p>
<p t="195430" d="5200">was something significant going on coming
out of Continental philosophy. And that's</p>
<p t="200630" d="3750">where the book [published 2004] came out of.
When you say significant, what do you mean</p>
<p t="204380" d="1000">by that? Do you mean intellectually? Do you
mean socially? Politically? There's lots</p>
<p t="205380" d="1030">of different variants of “significant.”When
you say significant, what do you mean by that?</p>
<p t="206410" d="4430">Do you mean intellectually? Do you mean socially?
Politically? There's lots of different variants</p>
<p t="210840" d="2670">of “significant.”
At that point, “intellectually.” This</p>
<p t="213510" d="6880">was still in the 1990s so postmodernism was
not yet (outside of, say, art) a cultural</p>
<p t="220390" d="6709">force, but it was strongly an intellectual
force in that. At that point, young Ph.D.s</p>
<p t="227099" d="7801">coming out of sociology, literary criticism,
some sub-disciplines in the law (if you're</p>
<p t="234900" d="8230">getting Ph.D. in the law), historiography
and so on, and certainly in departments in</p>
<p t="243130" d="6260">philosophy still dominated by Continental
traditional philosophy: almost all of them</p>
<p t="249390" d="8400">are primarily being schooled in what we now
call postmodern thinkers, so the leading gurus</p>
<p t="257790" d="7890">are people like Derrida, Lyotard, from whom
we get the label post-modern condition, Foucault</p>
<p t="265680" d="4660">and the others.
So maybe you could walk us through what you</p>
<p t="270340" d="6120">learned, because people are unfamiliar ... I
mean, you were advanced in your education,</p>
<p t="276460" d="6760">including in philosophy, and still recognized
your ignorance, say, with regards to postmodern</p>
<p t="283220" d="5559">thinking, so that's obviously a condition
that is shared by a large number of people.</p>
<p t="288779" d="3700">Postmodernism is one of those words like Existentialism
that covers an awful lot of territory, and</p>
<p t="292479" d="6151">so maybe we could zero in on exactly what
that means, and who these thinkers were: Derrida,</p>
<p t="298630" d="4420">Foucault, and Lyotard, and what you learned
about them.</p>
<p t="303050" d="5729">Fair enough. Well, all of the thinkers you
just named—they think broadly, they think</p>
<p t="308779" d="5551">strategically, and they do have a very strong
historical perspective on their disciplines,</p>
<p t="314330" d="4859">and at the same time they are trying to assess
where they think we are culturally, politically,</p>
<p t="319189" d="7090">socially—and all of them are making a very
dramatic claim: that to some extent or in</p>
<p t="326279" d="7880">some way Modernism has either ended or it
has reached its nadir, or all of the … kind</p>
<p t="334159" d="6970">of the pathologies and negative traits within
the modern world are reaching a culmination</p>
<p t="341129" d="6260">in their generation, and so it's time for
us to both recognize that Modernism has come</p>
<p t="347389" d="5071">to an end, and that we need some sort of new
intellectual framework, a post-modern-like</p>
<p t="352460" d="4750">framework.
And the Modernism that they're criticizing,</p>
<p t="357210" d="4799">how would you characterize that? That's
Enlightenment values? Scientific rationalism?</p>
<p t="362009" d="4811">How would you characterize it, exactly?
All of those would be elements of it. But</p>
<p t="366820" d="5769">then of course there are some discipline-specific
differences: so literature people and philosophy</p>
<p t="372589" d="6961">people and historians will use Modernism slightly
differently. But the idea at core is that</p>
<p t="379550" d="8360">if you look at the pre-modern world—essentially
the world of the Middle Ages, say—that that</p>
<p t="387910" d="6960">was itself broken up by a series of revolutions:
the Renaissance, Reformation, Counter Reformation,</p>
<p t="394870" d="5210">early scientific revolutions—and all of
this is going on in historically short chunks</p>
<p t="400080" d="4079">of time: 1500s and 1600s.</p>
<p t="404159" d="6680">And so if you look at both the intellectual
world and the social world, comparing, say,</p>
<p t="410839" d="7741">the 1400s with the 1700s, culturally and intellectually
you're in a different universe at that point.</p>
<p t="418580" d="5780">So the features then of the modern world—now
I'm going to use my philosophical labels</p>
<p t="424360" d="8139">here—are that we are now naturalistic in
our thinking. We are no longer primarily supernaturalistic</p>
<p t="432499" d="4880">in our thinking. So we might still be open
to the idea that there's a God or some sort</p>
<p t="437379" d="4750">of supernatural dimension, the way Deists
are, but first and foremost we're taking</p>
<p t="442129" d="6280">the natural world as a more or less self-contained,
self-governing world that operates according</p>
<p t="448409" d="3051">to cause and effect, and we're going to
study it in its terms.</p>
<p t="451460" d="6100">We're not seeing the natural world as derivative
of a “higher” world or that everything</p>
<p t="457560" d="5949">that happens in the natural world is part
of “God's plan” where we read omens</p>
<p t="463509" d="1511">and so forth into everything.</p>
<p t="465020" d="5579">So metaphysically then there's been a revolution:
We're naturalistic.</p>
<p t="470599" d="5780">Epistemologically—in terms of knowledge—there
also has been a revolution. How do we know</p>
<p t="476379" d="5010">the important truths? How do we acquire the
beliefs that we're fundamentally going to</p>
<p t="481389" d="5730">commit our lives to? Well, by the time we
become Moderns we take experience seriously,</p>
<p t="487119" d="6050">personal experience. We do that more rigorously
and we're developing scientific method (the</p>
<p t="493169" d="6220">way of organizing the data), we're taking
logic and all the sophisticated tools of rationality</p>
<p t="499389" d="3430">and developing those increasingly ...</p>
<p t="502819" d="3951">And so our opposition then is: Either you
know something because you can experience</p>
<p t="506770" d="6440">it and verify it for yourself, or we've done
the really hard work of scientific method</p>
<p t="513210" d="5110">and as a result of what comes out of that,
that's what we can call knowledge or our</p>
<p t="518320" d="1000">best approximation to that.</p>
<p t="519320" d="8019">And that's also revolutionary because the
prior intellectual framework was much more</p>
<p t="527339" d="7110">intellectually authoritarian in its framework.
You would accept in the Catholic tradition</p>
<p t="534449" d="4972">the authority of the Church. And who are you
to question the authority of the Church? And</p>
<p t="539421" d="4858">who are you to mouth empirical-rational arguments
against the authority of the Church?</p>
<p t="544279" d="5411">Or, you take the authority of Scripture, or
you accept on faith that you've had a mystical</p>
<p t="549690" d="1620">revelation of some sort.</p>
<p t="551310" d="6310">So, in all of those cases you have non-rational
epistemologies that are dominating intellectual</p>
<p t="557620" d="4840">discourse. That is all by and large swept
away in the modern world.</p>
<p t="562460" d="6799">Okay, so prior to the emergence of the modern
world, we'll say, people are dominated essentially</p>
<p t="569259" d="4981">by their willingness to adhere to a shared
tradition and that shared tradition is somewhat</p>
<p t="574240" d="4430">tyrannically enforced. But there's no real
alternative in terms of epistemology [epistemology:</p>
<p t="578670" d="1000">the theory of knowledge, especially with regard
to its methods, validity and scope: the investigation</p>
<p t="579670" d="1890">of what distinguishes justified belief from
opinion] let's say. And then as the modern</p>
<p t="581560" d="6949">world emerges, people discover the technologies
of science and the value of rigorously applied</p>
<p t="588509" d="6971">method and the comparison of shared experiences
and that makes us technologically powerful</p>
<p t="595480" d="3529">in a new way and philosophically different
from what we were before. ]</p>
<p t="599009" d="5261">Yes, the shared tradition phrase that you
added there, that's an important one. So</p>
<p t="604270" d="4230">I'd say in the early modern world there's
not necessarily a skepticism about shared</p>
<p t="608500" d="4370">traditions—so there would be an acceptance
of shared traditions—but the idea is that</p>
<p t="612870" d="5990">you would not uncritically accept your tradition.
You may accept your tradition, but only after</p>
<p t="618860" d="2930">you've thought it through and made your own
independent judgment.</p>
<p t="621790" d="5080">Okay, okay, so you're elevated to the status
of someone who's capable of taking a stance</p>
<p t="626870" d="4949">with regards to the tradition, and assessing
its presuppositions and so forth.</p>
<p t="631819" d="2821">Absolutely.
So there's an elevation of the individual</p>
<p t="634640" d="6439">and the critical intellect along with the
elaboration of the scientific method. Okay,</p>
<p t="641079" d="5901">so then we might note, perhaps, that that's
a tremendously effective transformation, although</p>
<p t="646980" d="4130">maybe it leads in a somewhat nihilistic direction
metaphysically—we can leave that to the</p>
<p t="651110" d="4909">side. But it's a very, very successful revolution,
because by the time, at least the beginning</p>
<p t="656019" d="5380">of the 20th century comes along, there's
this staggering (and of course before that,</p>
<p t="661399" d="4860">the Industrial Revolution), there's this
staggering transformation of technology and</p>
<p t="666259" d="5501">technological and conceptual power, and then
a stunning increase in the standard of living.</p>
<p t="671760" d="6389">And that starts at about 1890, to really move
exponentially in the 1890s, or at least to</p>
<p t="678149" d="6271">get to the really steep part of the exponential
curve. Okay, so that seems to be going well.</p>
<p t="684420" d="3409">So what is it that the postmodernists are
objecting to precisely?</p>
<p t="687829" d="8760">Just on those two issues: (1) the metaphysical
naturalism, and then (2) the elevation of</p>
<p t="696589" d="9031">kind of a critical empiricism and a belief
that we can, through science—even not necessarily</p>
<p t="705620" d="5490">a science, but social scientists and so on—we
can come to understand powerful general principles</p>
<p t="711110" d="3550">about humanity and social systems.</p>
<p t="714660" d="3630">Those two revolutions both are then subjected
to counter-attacks.</p>
<p t="718290" d="10349">And again, what happens in this case is there
is a revolution. Probably by the time we get</p>
<p t="728639" d="5611">to 1800—the height of the Enlightenment—there
are the beginnings of more powerful skeptical</p>
<p t="734250" d="6230">traditions that come to be developed, so thinkers
are starting to say things like: Well, if</p>
<p t="740480" d="5850">scientific method at root is based on the
evidence of the senses—we observe the natural</p>
<p t="746330" d="4810">world: that's our first point of contact—and
then on the basis of that we form abstractions,</p>
<p t="751140" d="5910">and then we put those abstractions into propositions,
and then we take those propositions and put</p>
<p t="757050" d="5740">them in networks that we call theories, and
so on—so we start to critically examine</p>
<p t="762790" d="6890">each of the elements of scientific method,
and over time, weaknesses in the existing</p>
<p t="769680" d="6240">accounts of how all of those “rational operations”
work come to be teased out, and philosophy</p>
<p t="775920" d="2820">then starts to go down a more skeptical path.</p>
<p t="778740" d="8580">So if, for example, you take perception as
fundamental—it's you know, the individual</p>
<p t="787320" d="4569">subject's first point of contact with the
natural world—then you have to immediately</p>
<p t="791889" d="8260">deal with issues of perceptual illusions,
or the possibility that people will have hallucinations,</p>
<p t="800149" d="7920">or that the way you report your perceptual
experience is at odds with how I report my</p>
<p t="808069" d="1351">perceptual experience.</p>
<p t="809420" d="6990">Tell me if I've got this right. So, with
the dawning of the “Empirical Age,” let's</p>
<p t="816410" d="6229">say, there's this idea that you can derive
valid information from sense data—especially</p>
<p t="822639" d="4601">if you contrast that sense data rigorously
with that of others—okay? So that's sort</p>
<p t="827240" d="2260">of the foundation for the scientific method
in some sense.</p>
<p t="829500" d="5040">But then—I think this is with Immanuel Kant—there's
an objection to that, which is that, Well,</p>
<p t="834540" d="6150">you can't make the presupposition that that
sense data enters your cognitive apparatus,</p>
<p t="840690" d="4920">your apparatus of understanding, without a
priori structuring, and it seems to me that</p>
<p t="845610" d="2820">that's where the postmodernists really go
after the modernists. It's that, given that</p>
<p t="848430" d="6110">you have to have a very complex perceptual
structure (that modern people might say was</p>
<p t="854540" d="4719">instantiated as a consequence of biological
evolution), you can't make the case that</p>
<p t="859259" d="3341">what you're receiving from the external
world is something like “pure information”:</p>
<p t="862600" d="7870">it's always subject—to some very-difficult-to-delimit
degree—to “interpretation.”</p>
<p t="870470" d="4300">And then you also have to take into account
the fact of that a priori structure and what</p>
<p t="874770" d="6330">it might mean for your concept of “objective
reality.” And that's Kant, I think, if</p>
<p t="881100" d="1000">I've got that right.</p>
<p t="882100" d="4130">Right. Well, the postmodernists will use both
of those strategies: (1) the anti-empiricist</p>
<p t="886230" d="4680">strategy, and (2) the anti-rationalist strategy.
And what's important about Kant is that</p>
<p t="890910" d="7049">Kant is integrating both of those “anti”
strategies. So in the generations before Kant,</p>
<p t="897959" d="3990">the skeptical arguments about perception which
were directed against the empiricists … the</p>
<p t="901949" d="4361">empiricists want to say that everything is
based on observational data, but then if you</p>
<p t="906310" d="5190">don't have good answers about hallucinations
and relativity and illusions and so forth,</p>
<p t="911500" d="6410">then it seems like your intellectual structure,
whatever it seems to be, if it's based on</p>
<p t="917910" d="4950">probabilistic or possibly faulty perceptual
data—then the whole thing is a tottering</p>
<p t="922860" d="1000">mess. [Empiricism: the theory stating that
knowledge comes only or primarily from sensory</p>
<p t="923860" d="1000">experience. Empirical research, including
experiments and validated measurement tools,</p>
<p t="924860" d="1000">guide the scientific method.]</p>
<p t="925860" d="6349">And by the time we get to Kant, the Empiricist
tradition is largely unable to respond to</p>
<p t="932209" d="3740">those kinds of objections. And so Kant is
recognizing and saying: All right, we've</p>
<p t="935949" d="5351">been trying now for a couple of centuries,
we haven't been able to do so successfully—we're</p>
<p t="941300" d="1949">not going to be able to do so.</p>
<p t="943249" d="6731">Now, you also nicely emphasized that one of
the other responses had been on the Rationalist</p>
<p t="949980" d="5810">side, which is to say, “Well, no you don't
start with pure empirical data—instead we</p>
<p t="955790" d="6890">do have perhaps some innate a priori structures
built into the human mind—how they got there,</p>
<p t="962680" d="5870">maybe they're put there by God, maybe they're
put there naturalistically or whatever—but</p>
<p t="968550" d="6050">what enables us to have legitimate knowledge
is that our empirical data comes in and it</p>
<p t="974600" d="5760">is filtered and structured by these pre-existing
cognitive structures as well.”</p>
<p t="980360" d="5699">Now the problem with that side of the line—and
this is also well worked out by the time you</p>
<p t="986059" d="4580">get to the Kantians—is to say: Well, if
you're starting with in-built cognitive</p>
<p t="990639" d="4670">structures, and everything that comes in,
so to speak, goes through this structuring</p>
<p t="995309" d="6640">machine and you're aware of the outputs—because
that's what is presented to your mind—well</p>
<p t="1001949" d="5731">how do you know those in-built structures
have anything to do with the way reality actually</p>
<p t="1007680" d="1050">is out there?</p>
<p t="1008730" d="7789">It seems like then what you are stuck with
is the end result of a subjective processing,</p>
<p t="1016519" d="4180">and there is no way for you, so to speak,
to “jump outside of your head” to compare</p>
<p t="1020699" d="5981">the end result with the way the world actually
is, independently of how your mind has structured</p>
<p t="1026680" d="1000">the awareness.</p>
<p t="1027680" d="4640">So once again, you're stuck in a rather
subjective place.</p>
<p t="1032320" d="4160">And again, the importance of Kant here is
then he's also looking at this more Rationalist</p>
<p t="1036480" d="3150">tradition and he's saying, Well look, again
we've been trying now for a couple of centuries</p>
<p t="1039630" d="5910">to work these things out from Descartes to
Spinoza, Leibniz and the others, and Rationalism</p>
<p t="1045540" d="5390">also has reached a dead end, so we're not
going to be able to do so.</p>
<p t="1050930" d="4180">So Kant is, in effect, standing at the end
of these two traditions and saying, “You</p>
<p t="1055110" d="6160">know, the skeptics have it right on both sides:
both the Empiricist and the Rationalist traditions</p>
<p t="1061270" d="5960">fail. There is no way for us to objectively
come to know an external reality. We're</p>
<p t="1067230" d="2780">stuck in some sort of deep subjectivism.”</p>
<p t="1070010" d="5570">Okay, so I don't know now whether to talk
a little bit about the American Pragmatic</p>
<p t="1075580" d="4640">approach to that, or whether to ... Maybe
we should go ahead and continue our discussion</p>
<p t="1080220" d="2660">of the postmodernists, because they're developing
these claims.</p>
<p t="1082880" d="4230">Absolutely, and some of the postmodernists
do describe themselves as Neo-Pragmatists,</p>
<p t="1087110" d="5954">like Richard Rorty for example. So yes, that's
exactly a direction that's worth going.</p>
<p t="1093064" d="6016">Okay, okay. So my understanding of that, if
I was going to defend the Modernist tradition,</p>
<p t="1099080" d="6490">let's say, I would say that we have instantiated
within us an a priori perceptual structure</p>
<p t="1105570" d="5530">that's a consequence of millions—billions
of years for that matter—of biological evolution,</p>
<p t="1111100" d="7570">and it has emerged in tandem with continual
correction of its presuppositions by the selection</p>
<p t="1118670" d="6730">process. But it's still subject to error
because we have a very limited viewpoint as</p>
<p t="1125400" d="7390">specific individuals, and not only are we
limited, but we can also make, you might say,</p>
<p t="1132790" d="4390">moral errors, and I'll get back to that,
that cloud our judgment.</p>
<p t="1137180" d="6750">And so, in an attempt to “expand our purview”
and rectify those errors, we do two things:</p>
<p t="1143930" d="5150">(1) We test our hypothesis practically against
the world, which is to say, we say, “Here's</p>
<p t="1149080" d="4550">a theory of reality.” We act it out. If
the theory of reality is sufficiently correct,</p>
<p t="1153630" d="5040">when we act it out, we get what we want, and
then that's sufficient proof for the validity</p>
<p t="1158670" d="3440">of the theory. It's not absolute proof,
but it's sufficient proof. And then the</p>
<p t="1162110" d="4150">other thing we do (and I think this has been
paid attention to much less except by thinkers</p>
<p t="1166260" d="7320">such as Piaget) is that: (2) We further constrain
our presuppositions about reality with the</p>
<p t="1173580" d="5190">necessity of constructing theories that are
also acceptable to the people around us.</p>
<p t="1178770" d="7481">So they have to be integrate-able within the
currently existing social contract, and they</p>
<p t="1186251" d="4869">have to be functionally appropriate in the
external world.</p>
<p t="1191120" d="3501">And that's a nice set of constraints, and
it seems to me that that, at least in some</p>
<p t="1194621" d="9680">part, goes a long ways to answering the objections
to the limits of the scientific method that</p>
<p t="1204301" d="2959">have been discussed historically, and which
you just summarized.</p>
<p t="1207260" d="10330">All right, I'm sympathetic to much of what
you just went through. In fact a five-point</p>
<p t="1217590" d="3800">response to the kinds of arguments that have
been laid out, where you're actually putting</p>
<p t="1221390" d="7290">me in the position then of defending the postmodern
tradition about how it would undercut each</p>
<p t="1228680" d="1630">of those components.</p>
<p t="1230310" d="3945">So, if you take for example evolutionary epistemology
[epistemology: investigation into the origin,</p>
<p t="1234255" d="2735">nature, methods and limits of human knowledge],
and you gave a nice sketch of one standard</p>
<p t="1236990" d="6270">evolutionary epistemological frame in which
you say: Maybe we have in-built a priori structures,</p>
<p t="1243260" d="5760">but we can rely upon them because here we
are standing at the long end of hundreds of</p>
<p t="1249020" d="6150">thousands or millions of years of evolution,
and they would not have survived or enabled</p>
<p t="1255170" d="7380">us to survive had they not served some sort
of reliable cognitive role in accurately representing</p>
<p t="1262550" d="5050">the way the world works.</p>
<p t="1267600" d="3261">This is actually too early for the postmoderns,
although the postmoderns will agree with this.</p>
<p t="1270861" d="5949">This is to say that all of that kind of begs
the question in a very deep way against the</p>
<p t="1276810" d="7800">kind of skeptical objections that we're
raising. Because in order to make that paragraph-long</p>
<p t="1284610" d="5930">description of what evolutionary epistemology
is, what I have to do is take for granted</p>
<p t="1290540" d="7180">basic assumptions, certain truths about the
world: that, for example, there is an external</p>
<p t="1297720" d="8240">world; that we are biological creatures; that
we have in-built structures; that those structures</p>
<p t="1305960" d="7550">are evolutionarily responsive and conditioned
by changing forces; and so forth.</p>
<p t="1313510" d="6480">And if you take those assumptions to be true,
then as a consequence or as a conclusion,</p>
<p t="1319990" d="8700">you can infer that therefore the intellectual
products that come out of our cognitive processing</p>
<p t="1328690" d="4020">are reliable.</p>
<p t="1332710" d="6400">But where did you get those four premises
from? How do you know that there is an external</p>
<p t="1339110" d="6200">world? How do you know that we are biological
creatures? How do you know that evolution</p>
<p t="1345310" d="4660">is true, with all of the historical knowledge
that's necessary to reach the conclusion</p>
<p t="1349970" d="7540">that evolution is true? All of that presupposes
that we have legitimate cognitive methods</p>
<p t="1357510" d="5280">to come to understand the world. But our having
legitimate cognitive processes to understand</p>
<p t="1362790" d="4730">the world—that's exactly what we are arguing
about in the first place, and you can't</p>
<p t="1367520" d="4440">just assume that, for then the sake of coming
up with some premises that are then in turn</p>
<p t="1371960" d="3430">going to validate those cognitive processes.</p>
<p t="1375390" d="7060">So something like that they will say is a
big circle or a circular-reasoning problem</p>
<p t="1382450" d="3560">that evolutionary epistemology finds itself
trapped in.</p>
<p t="1386010" d="5190">Now I think that there are some responses
to that, and this is just the first “back</p>
<p t="1391200" d="4490">and forth” on that particular debate. But
that is the kind of response that would be</p>
<p t="1395690" d="1000">there.</p>
<p t="1396690" d="4290">The third and fourth response (if I'm keeping
track accurately) is to say that we also have</p>
<p t="1400980" d="9041">constraints with respect to ourselves: that
if we have a certain set of hypotheses or</p>
<p t="1410021" d="6629">a certain set of theories and we're testing
them out, we will accept those that give us</p>
<p t="1416650" d="3730">“what we want,” what I want, so to speak.</p>
<p t="1420380" d="5760">And I'm also necessarily in a social situation
so what I need to do is check my results against</p>
<p t="1426140" d="4950">the results of others: peer review, experiment
replication and so forth.</p>
<p t="1431090" d="2360">[smiles] ... ability to live in the same household
...</p>
<p t="1433450" d="5420">[laughs] Yes, absolutely, right? More prosaically,
“sharing our frameworks with others,”</p>
<p t="1438870" d="1190">right? And so on...</p>
<p t="1440060" d="6490">And so if, so to speak—and this is the more
Pragmatist orientation—if we then say we</p>
<p t="1446550" d="7130">have a theory or a set of principles or guidelines
or whatever, and they do enable me successfully</p>
<p t="1453680" d="6190">to navigate the world to get what I want,
or they do enable me to navigate my social</p>
<p t="1459870" d="6790">world to get us what we want—then they're
reliable, true, or some sort of “success”</p>
<p t="1466660" d="2210">label, epistemologically, that we're going
to give to them.</p>
<p t="1468870" d="4630">Okay, so let me ask you a question about that.
This is a place where I got augured in very</p>
<p t="1473500" d="6010">badly with Sam Harris when we were discussing
metaphysical presumptions. So you know—and</p>
<p t="1479510" d="4930">I'm confused about this I would say to some
degree conceptually because I'm a scientist</p>
<p t="1484440" d="5081">and certainly operate most of the time under
the presupposition of an “independent objective</p>
<p t="1489521" d="7459">world”—but then I also have some difficulty
with the idea that it's objective truth</p>
<p t="1496980" d="4740">within which all other truths are “nested.”
And that's something that Sam and the people</p>
<p t="1501720" d="4500">that he represents in some sense are very
dead set on insisting.</p>
<p t="1506220" d="5210">Now it seems to me though that the crux of
the matter is something like “the method</p>
<p t="1511430" d="7450">of proof.” And this strikes me as very important
because, “My theory is correct enough if,</p>
<p t="1518880" d="5421">when I implement it, I get what I want”
is not the same as the claim “My theory</p>
<p t="1524301" d="5069">is true because it's in accordance with
some independently existing objective world.”</p>
<p t="1529370" d="5820">I mean, both of those things could exist at
the same time, but I think the more appropriate</p>
<p t="1535190" d="5070">claim to make with regards to human knowledge
is something like its “biological functionality,”</p>
<p t="1540260" d="5650">which is that your knowledge is of sufficient
accuracy (which is about the best you can</p>
<p t="1545910" d="5620">hope for because of your fundamental ignorance)
if, when you implement it, it reliably produces</p>
<p t="1551530" d="3680">the results that are commensurate, say, with
your continued existence.</p>
<p t="1555210" d="4001">Now it seems to me that that's a reasonable
claim from a Darwinian perspective [Charles</p>
<p t="1559211" d="2299">Darwin, 1809-1882] and it also seems to me
that it's very much in keeping with the</p>
<p t="1561510" d="5820">claims of the American Pragmatists. And I
mean, it's not like they were radical postmodernists</p>
<p t="1567330" d="1000">...</p>
<p t="1568330" d="1000">Right...</p>
<p t="1569330" d="3801">...because they weren't. But they were trying
to solve this problem to some degree of our</p>
<p t="1573131" d="4910">fundamental ignorance and our inability to
be certain about the nature of the reality</p>
<p t="1578041" d="1289">that surrounds us.</p>
<p t="1579330" d="7170">Yes, okay. Let's set aside Sam Harris's
version of this and focus on the Pragmatist</p>
<p t="1586500" d="3070">tradition here. So, no, you're absolutely
right.</p>
<p t="1589570" d="3660">The Pragmatists, William James [1842-1910],
John Dewey [1859-1952], and the others, late</p>
<p t="1593230" d="8640">1800s, early 1900s; they are coming a century
after the Kantian revolution [Immanuel Kant,</p>
<p t="1601870" d="4280">1724-1804], after Hegelianism [G. W. F. Hegel,
1770-1831], and so forth—and so they are</p>
<p t="1606150" d="6270">very much trying to solve this problem. One
way—and this is kind of a very American</p>
<p t="1612420" d="8120">way—is like: Look, maybe the problem with
philosophy is that we have been too intellectualizing</p>
<p t="1620540" d="7670">of cognition, that we're not just disembodied
brains or disembodied minds that are trying</p>
<p t="1628210" d="6900">to contemplate abstract truths in some other
realm. Maybe what we need to do is understand</p>
<p t="1635110" d="6930">the mind and cognition as a naturalistic process
and that the purpose of knowledge is not to</p>
<p t="1642040" d="4590">come up with these pure and beautiful Truths
that are going to be kind of museum pieces</p>
<p t="1646630" d="6440">that we will admire, but rather the purpose
of knowledge is functional. The purpose of</p>
<p t="1653070" d="8550">knowledge is to guide action. And so they
will then hearken back to the earlier Baconian</p>
<p t="1661620" d="6400">tradition that knowledge is not an end in
itself. As Bacon put it, Francis Bacon [1561-1626]:</p>
<p t="1668020" d="7370">Knowledge is power, and by its fruits, so
to speak, is how you know its worth.</p>
<p t="1675390" d="1140">Right.</p>
<p t="1676530" d="8420">And so what we then should do is to see that
the test of truth is not whether it meets</p>
<p t="1684950" d="7510">purely intellectual standards of logic and
mathematics, but rather, when we put it into</p>
<p t="1692460" d="5860">practice, when we act upon it, we actually
get good results, or we want the results we</p>
<p t="1698320" d="5840">want, or I get the results I want. And it
can come in more individualistic form or more</p>
<p t="1704160" d="1020">socialized form.</p>
<p t="1705180" d="3890">Right, because then we can get on with things,
too. Like, despite our ignorance, in some</p>
<p t="1709070" d="1000">sense.</p>
<p t="1710070" d="4640">So there are two things which are being packaged
here, right? One is to say that knowledge</p>
<p t="1714710" d="4900">is functional. And that part I think is important
and I think it's a very nice correction</p>
<p t="1719610" d="5520">by the Pragmatists. It's not original with
them but they are reemphasizing it in the</p>
<p t="1725130" d="9360">19th century. Knowledge needs to be put to
the test and its ability to enable us to be</p>
<p t="1734490" d="4020">pragmatic in the real world, is its test.</p>
<p t="1738510" d="6020">[28:59] There's a coda to that as well.
And I think this is relevant to Thomas Kuhn's</p>
<p t="1744530" d="5270">[1922-1996] discussion of scientific revolutions,
because Kuhn is often read as positing a sequence</p>
<p t="1749800" d="8330">of, in some sense, discontinuous revolutions,
and that the conceptual structure that characterized</p>
<p t="1758130" d="8040">one “epoch,” let's say—like the Medieval
epoch—was so totally different in its presuppositions</p>
<p t="1766170" d="4530">from the conceptions that characterized the
next epoch … that you can't even mediate</p>
<p t="1770700" d="1800">between them in some sense.</p>
<p t="1772500" d="4570">Now the reason I'm bringing this up is because
Kuhn is at least read as hypothesizing that</p>
<p t="1777070" d="5000">there's not any necessary “progress”
when you make leaps from one conceptual system</p>
<p t="1782070" d="4580">to another. But if you take this pragmatic
approach—the one that we've been outlining—it</p>
<p t="1786650" d="6490">seems to me that you can say, Well, it's
something like this: Your conceptions of the</p>
<p t="1793140" d="6690">world are more tool-like than objective-truth-like,
and tools can have a greater or lesser range</p>
<p t="1799830" d="4680">of convenience. And so if you come up with
a really good tool—which would also be something</p>
<p t="1804510" d="3640">that would look objectively true, generally
speaking—then that's something that you</p>
<p t="1808150" d="4700">can use in almost every situation and it will
never fail you. And I would think of something</p>
<p t="1812850" d="5270">like Newtonian physics in that regard, or
even more particularly, quantum mechanics,</p>
<p t="1818120" d="1760">because it's never failed us.</p>
<p t="1819880" d="4240">And so it seems to me the Pragmatic approach
in some sense allows you to have your cake</p>
<p t="1824120" d="5790">and eat it too. You can posit a hierarchy
of truths, moving towards absolute truth even,</p>
<p t="1829910" d="5290">but also retain your belief in your own ignorance
and not have to beat the drum too hard about</p>
<p t="1835200" d="6000">the “eternal accuracy” of your objective
presuppositions.</p>
<p t="1841200" d="6480">Okay. Again I'm sympathetic I think with
about 80 percent of that. But let me put my</p>
<p t="1847680" d="7460">skeptical hat back on and say how the postmodernists
or the critics of Pragmatism—critics really</p>
<p t="1855140" d="8820">of first-generation Pragmatism—will respond
to that. So if we then say: All of these cognitive</p>
<p t="1863960" d="3640">results … I'm going to rephrase that.</p>
<p t="1867600" d="1000">Okay.</p>
<p t="1868600" d="5930">So if we're going to assess all of our cognitive
results or cognitive hypotheses in terms of</p>
<p t="1874530" d="5950">their workability, or their “getting what
I want” or “what we want,” well then</p>
<p t="1880480" d="5410">the big question we have to turn to is to
say, How do we judge whether something works?</p>
<p t="1885890" d="1000">Yes.</p>
<p t="1886890" d="9040">Or how do I say that, “It's good because
I get what I want” or “We get what we</p>
<p t="1895930" d="6300">want.” Well, what is a “want”? And where
did these “wants” come from? And why should</p>
<p t="1902230" d="7350">we accept “wants” and “desires” and
“achieving certain goals” as our bottom</p>
<p t="1909580" d="1380">line, so to speak?</p>
<p t="1910960" d="4450">Right, okay. That's right. So you can start
to question the framework, the validity of</p>
<p t="1915410" d="2670">the framework within which you're constructing
the answer.</p>
<p t="1918080" d="3660">That's right. And at this point we're
reading epistemology [epistemology: the theory</p>
<p t="1921740" d="1000">of knowledge, especially with regard to its
methods, validity and scope: the investigation</p>
<p t="1922740" d="1080">of what distinguishes justified belief from
opinion] “neutrally” so to speak; and</p>
<p t="1923820" d="8220">moving into normative issues, then the whole
status of normative goals—ends and the means</p>
<p t="1932040" d="3950">that are going to enable us to reach those
ends—comes into play.</p>
<p t="1935990" d="5490">So if I want to say, “The most important
thing is that I”—I'll put it very baldly</p>
<p t="1941480" d="7000">here—“I get what I want,” right? And
I'm going to assess intellectual structures</p>
<p t="1948480" d="5500">and beliefs and hypotheses in terms of, “Do
they give me what I want?” Well, that sounds</p>
<p t="1953980" d="8080">already sounds like a fairly normatively subjectivistic
standpoint. Like, why should you take your</p>
<p t="1962060" d="7400">“wants” as having some sort of high status
that everything has to be evaluated in terms</p>
<p t="1969460" d="1000">of?</p>
<p t="1970460" d="1000">Uh huh.</p>
<p t="1971460" d="3300">And then philosophically we say: Where do
“wants” come from? And of course there's</p>
<p t="1974760" d="6340">a long anthropological and psychological set
of literature here. What's the source of</p>
<p t="1981100" d="5790">our “wants”? Are they based in biological
drives? Are they instinctual? Are they acquired?</p>
<p t="1986890" d="6170">Are they intellectual? Do they have any relationship
to our rational capacities? When I'm acting,</p>
<p t="1993060" d="4260">should I act on my desires and my wants, and
so forth?</p>
<p t="1997320" d="5580">So there's that whole tradition, and we
have to have a sophisticated theory about</p>
<p t="2002900" d="4680">how all of that is going to work if we're
going to say we'll solve all of these cognitive</p>
<p t="2007580" d="5270">epistemological issues in terms of “wants”
or the satisfaction of “desires” or the</p>
<p t="2012850" d="5220">“achievement of goals” the way pragmatists
want us to do.</p>
<p t="2018070" d="5330">And again, it's fairly easy to imagine what
the skeptical argument is likely going to</p>
<p t="2023400" d="4410">be. If it's a matter of what I want—well,
isn't science supposed to be about coming</p>
<p t="2027810" d="4510">up with general truths or maybe even universal
truths?</p>
<p t="2032320" d="1000">Okay …</p>
<p t="2033320" d="3270">And if it's immediately going to devolve
into whatever individuals want, well then</p>
<p t="2036590" d="2140">we're going to go in fairly scattered directions.</p>
<p t="2038730" d="6410">Okay, so that also opens up a good point for
a segue into the potential link between Neo-Marxism,</p>
<p t="2045140" d="2260">let's say, and Postmodernism.</p>
<p t="2047400" d="1000">Sure.</p>
<p t="2048400" d="6310">Because maybe you could say: Once you've opened
the door to an admission that you can criticize</p>
<p t="2054710" d="4810">the idea of “want” as a social construct,
let's say—which is one of the things that</p>
<p t="2059520" d="5849">you intimated (not the only thing, obviously)—then
you open the door to also making the claim</p>
<p t="2065369" d="5081">that that social construct that governs the
“wants,” that governs the “truth,”</p>
<p t="2070450" d="3740">can be governed by “power relationships,”
something like that, and then by “unfair</p>
<p t="2074190" d="1000">power relationships.”</p>
<p t="2075190" d="1000">Exactly.</p>
<p t="2076190" d="2330">So you can spin off down that aisle.</p>
<p t="2078520" d="3700">And that's the other thing I really want
to talk to you about, because on the one hand</p>
<p t="2082220" d="6140">the postmodernists are following this intellectual
tradition of the critique of Western thinking,</p>
<p t="2088360" d="5590">which is exactly in some sense what philosophy
should be doing. But in another way, they</p>
<p t="2093950" d="5140">seem simultaneously to be introducing, almost
by sleight of hand, a kind of social critique</p>
<p t="2099090" d="6950">that has its origin more in political revolution
and class-based theory, and they do that under</p>
<p t="2106040" d="5620">the guise of pure philosophy, in some sense,
but with the intent and motivation of something</p>
<p t="2111660" d="6420">like justifying the social revolution, or
continuing the Marxist analysis of power differential.</p>
<p t="2118080" d="4300">It can go both ways, yes. Right? It is possible
to follow the road that we've just been</p>
<p t="2122380" d="5000">going down, to say, Well, you know, if it's
a matter about ‘what works for you,' then</p>
<p t="2127380" d="6260">that immediately starts to sound too relativistic
and subjectivistic and we don't have an</p>
<p t="2133640" d="3340">answer to all the weirdos who want to do strange
things—because that's what they want to</p>
<p t="2136980" d="5050">do—so we might introduce as a corrective
a socializing of the process.</p>
<p t="2142030" d="1000">Right.</p>
<p t="2143030" d="3100">So we might then say, No, it's not so much
what you want as an individual, but rather</p>
<p t="2146130" d="4490">what we want, and we have to achieve some
sort of a consensus here.</p>
<p t="2150620" d="4060">So that's a slightly cartoon version, but
the difference between William James, who</p>
<p t="2154680" d="5120">was more individualistic, and John Dewey in
the next generation who collectivized things</p>
<p t="2159800" d="5680">a bit more. So then we have a corrective on
all of the individual weirdos—who knows</p>
<p t="2165480" d="2110">what their desires and goals are going to
be?</p>
<p t="2167590" d="1000">Right.</p>
<p t="2168590" d="3420">But anyway, of course we just confront the
same problem there, as soon as we start doing</p>
<p t="2172010" d="4490">anthropology, because then if we say: Well,
if we relativize it to the social group, when</p>
<p t="2176500" d="4320">we start looking at different social groups,
obviously different social groups have dramatically</p>
<p t="2180820" d="4260">different wants and needs and desires, and
they've evolved very different traditions.</p>
<p t="2185080" d="6611">And if it's a matter of saying “What's
true is what works for the group,” there</p>
<p t="2191691" d="8269">is then no über group or highest group of
all groups that has status over all of the</p>
<p t="2199960" d="1000">others.</p>
<p t="2200960" d="4760">And if you do—and this is the second point
that you said exactly right—then you're</p>
<p t="2205720" d="5900">saying, Well, no, no, this group's norms
and its goals are better than that group's</p>
<p t="2211620" d="1000">goals or norms …</p>
<p t="2212620" d="1000">Right.</p>
<p t="2213620" d="6410">… and so then you're into what the critics
are going to call “imperialism” of the</p>
<p t="2220030" d="1000">inappropriate form …</p>
<p t="2221030" d="6620">Right, and so that leaves us with our current
political situation in some sense, because</p>
<p t="2227650" d="8450">that idea has been taken to … that's a
logical conclusion, and that logical conclusion</p>
<p t="2236100" d="5640">has now been instantiated to a large degree
as an intellectual and political activist</p>
<p t="2241740" d="1500">movement, I would say.</p>
<p t="2243240" d="3690">Right, sure, absolutely. So it can start as
an intellectual movement and what we're</p>
<p t="2246930" d="3000">trying to do is some hard-core epistemology
[epistemology: the theory of knowledge, especially</p>
<p t="2249930" d="1000">with regard to its methods, validity and scope:
the investigation of what distinguishes justified</p>
<p t="2250930" d="2850">belief from opinion] and we go the Empiricists
and the Rationalists and the Kantian revolution</p>
<p t="2253780" d="3750">and the Pragmatists, right? And now we're
in the second-generation Pragmatism where</p>
<p t="2257530" d="5560">we relativize into various cognitive groups
and then we're just stuck in a kind of group</p>
<p t="2263090" d="5500">relativism, and in the operational principles
socially then is going to be that each group</p>
<p t="2268590" d="6010">so to speak should stick to itself and not
think that it can impose its ideas and its</p>
<p t="2274600" d="6120">norms on any other group, right? All groups,
so to speak, are equal.</p>
<p t="2280720" d="5660">Yeah, well, at least they have an equal claim
to their formulation of the truth. The problem</p>
<p t="2286380" d="8080">with the postmodern conjunction with Neo-Marxism
to me seems to be the acceptance of the idea</p>
<p t="2294460" d="6590">that there's an intrinsic moral claim by
the “dispossessed” to the obtaining of</p>
<p t="2301050" d="4650">status, and that actually constitutes a higher
moral calling in and of itself! So they're</p>
<p t="2305700" d="5750">swallowing a moral claim in making it “universal”
in some sense at the same time they criticize</p>
<p t="2311450" d="3430">the idea of, say, “general narratives”
or “universal moral claims.”</p>
<p t="2314880" d="3800">Okay, now that's also right. That's the
other way to say that. Rather than starting</p>
<p t="2318680" d="6700">with epistemology and getting to a kind of
cultural relativism, you can start, of course,</p>
<p t="2325380" d="1670">committed to a certain normative [normative:
implying, creating, or prescribing a norm</p>
<p t="2327050" d="5860">or standard] framework or a certain ideological
framework (as Marxism is) where you're very</p>
<p t="2332910" d="6271">critical of one of those traditions, and then
the cultural relativism can be a part of that,</p>
<p t="2339181" d="8499">that you use, to criticize the tradition “internally”
so to speak. Now then we're explicitly into—not</p>
<p t="2347680" d="6090">kind of “meta-ethics” and asking where
do we get our ethical principles off the ground—but</p>
<p t="2353770" d="5210">where do they come from in the first place,
but kind of a robust “normative” ethics</p>
<p t="2358980" d="7040">where people have commitments to fairly strong
ethical principles and ethical ideals.</p>
<p t="2366020" d="8340">This is where the debate between, say, Nietzsche
and Marx becomes relevant. This is a late</p>
<p t="2374360" d="5830">19th century debate. So suppose we say, as
both the Marxists do and the Nietzscheans</p>
<p t="2380190" d="6350">do, let's say: There is no “Truth” in
any objective sense. All we have is subjectivity</p>
<p t="2386540" d="5810">and relativity of various sorts, and we have
different individuals and different groups,</p>
<p t="2392350" d="7670">and they are in antagonistic conflict relations
with each other, and that means there's</p>
<p t="2400020" d="6240">not really going to be any rational and civil
resolution [40:04] of these discussions with</p>
<p t="2406260" d="5060">each other; instead, it all comes down to
power.</p>
<p t="2411320" d="3870">Yeah, and that's the strange sleight of
hand claim there too, because why it has to</p>
<p t="2415190" d="5160">come down to power? Again that seems to introduce
the idea of “necessary need” ….</p>
<p t="2420350" d="5410">Okay, okay, yes, all right. That's another
thing. Let's set that aside just for a moment.</p>
<p t="2425760" d="1170">Yep, okay.</p>
<p t="2426930" d="4920">So then we say: Okay, so we have power. And
one thing that we can say is: While we don't</p>
<p t="2431850" d="7680">think any one individual, or any one group,
has a better objective claim to truth or better</p>
<p t="2439530" d="6620">ideals, it is nonetheless the case that some
individuals and groups have more power than</p>
<p t="2446150" d="7380">others, and so then we have to make our allegiance
clear in this unequal power struggle: Are</p>
<p t="2453530" d="4900">we on the side of those who have more power
or are we on the side of those who have less</p>
<p t="2458430" d="1000">power?</p>
<p t="2459430" d="4690">And that's where when we get then a Nietzschean
and a Marxian “fork in the road.” So the</p>
<p t="2464120" d="6070">Nietzscheans, following Nietzsche, will say:
Look, it's all about power. We can try on</p>
<p t="2470190" d="6370">some crude evolutionary thinking here: It's
only by the exercise of power by the stronger,</p>
<p t="2476560" d="6550">the fitter, the healthier, and so forth, who
are willing to impose their power on the weaker</p>
<p t="2483110" d="4610">and use them for their own ends, that we as
individuals and groups are going to make any</p>
<p t="2487720" d="5610">sort of progress toward the next best thing,
whatever that is. So in the power struggle</p>
<p t="2493330" d="8000">there is no objective morality, no objective
truth. We just throw our lot in with the stronger,</p>
<p t="2501330" d="4950">with the richer, with the more powerful, and
say: Whatever it is that they do to advance</p>
<p t="2506280" d="6100">themselves, that's the normative best that
we can do. And of course there's a long</p>
<p t="2512380" d="5590">kind of aristocratic tradition in normative
thinking that one can draw on to support that.</p>
<p t="2517970" d="5750">And then the Marxists of course are just on
the other side of that equation, where their</p>
<p t="2523720" d="7980">sympathies initially are going to be to say,
in any power struggle: “Our a priori commitments</p>
<p t="2531700" d="7290">should always be to the weaker, to those on
the losing end of history, those who suffer,”</p>
<p t="2538990" d="5830">and so forth, and it's always the bad, rich
and powerful people who are oppressing and</p>
<p t="2544820" d="6299">harming them. And so we throw our lot in with
the weaker and we're willing to use power,</p>
<p t="2551119" d="3161">whatever amount of power we have, on behalf
of the weaker.</p>
<p t="2554280" d="1000">Right.</p>
<p t="2555280" d="4150">And then we're just into what I think of
as the major false alternative that really</p>
<p t="2559430" d="6010">has driven much of 20th century intellectual
life: Are you a Nietzschean or are you a Marxist?</p>
<p t="2565440" d="4450">Right, right. Well okay. So now we can get
to the crux of the matter here to some degree,</p>
<p t="2569890" d="4790">because to even engage in that argument means
to accept the a priori position, which you've</p>
<p t="2574680" d="5630">made quite rationally compelling, let's
say, that “It's power. It's power. Because</p>
<p t="2580310" d="4500">there's no other way of differentiating
between the claims of different groups, it's</p>
<p t="2584810" d="1760">power that's the determining issue.”</p>
<p t="2586570" d="1000">Yes.</p>
<p t="2587570" d="4010">But that's something that I really have
a problem with. And I think it's of crucial</p>
<p t="2591580" d="5510">importance. Because first of all I think there's
a big difference between power and authority</p>
<p t="2597090" d="5310">and competence. Those are all not the same
thing, because you might be willing to cede</p>
<p t="2602400" d="5880">greater status to me in some domains if there
are things I can do, that you value, that</p>
<p t="2608280" d="4880">you can't do. And that's not power exactly.
Power seems to be more that I'm willing</p>
<p t="2613160" d="5970">to use force to impose my interpretation of
the world to get my wants fulfilled on you,</p>
<p t="2619130" d="3910">and it seems to me that where the Marxists
make a huge mistake—not that the Nietzscheans</p>
<p t="2623040" d="4030">aren't making mistakes as well—but where
the Marxists make a huge mistake is that they</p>
<p t="2627070" d="5760">fail to properly differentiate between hierarchies
of interpretation that are predicated on tyrannical</p>
<p t="2632830" d="6390">power, and hierarchies of interpretation that
are predicated on authority, competence, and</p>
<p t="2639220" d="4010">mutual consent.</p>
<p t="2643230" d="4150">The other issue that they fail to contend
with—and I believe this is a form of willful</p>
<p t="2647380" d="6780">blindness—is that it isn't obviously the
case that “every society is set up equally</p>
<p t="2654160" d="5740">to only fulfil the desires of the people who
are, in principle, situated at the pinnacles</p>
<p t="2659900" d="3830">of the hierarchies.” I actually don't
think that that's fundamentally characteristic</p>
<p t="2663730" d="4220">of the Western tradition, because it has a
very strong emphasis—weirdly enough, and</p>
<p t="2667950" d="8750">this is how I think it “extracts” itself
out of the conundrum which accepting a socialized</p>
<p t="2676700" d="6710">version of truth presents to you: The West
does two things: (1) It says, We have a social</p>
<p t="2683410" d="3830">contract that constrains our views of the
world and our actions in it, but (2) that</p>
<p t="2687240" d="7010">contract is also simultaneously subordinate
to the idea of the sovereignty of each individual.</p>
<p t="2694250" d="6330">And so the social contract then is bound to
serve the needs of each individual—not any</p>
<p t="2700580" d="4039">privileged set of individuals, although sometimes
it works out that way—and I don't believe</p>
<p t="2704619" d="5651">that the postmodernists have contended with
that properly, with their criticism of “logocentrism”</p>
<p t="2710270" d="2790">for example, which was something that characterized
Derrida.</p>
<p t="2713060" d="4080">‘Cause I think that that … ‘cause I
… It doesn't … it never has seemed to</p>
<p t="2717140" d="6910">me that what you had with Stalinist Russia
and the Marxist view of the world, and what</p>
<p t="2724050" d="6530">you had on the side of the West, was merely
a matter of a difference of opinion between</p>
<p t="2730580" d="4870">two equally valid socialized modes of interpreting
the world, you know? There's something wrong</p>
<p t="2735450" d="7070">about … There's something more to the
view of the West than what's embodied in</p>
<p t="2742520" d="4030">the conflict between, say, capitalism and
socialism. Because it could have just been</p>
<p t="2746550" d="6060">a matter of argumentation and opinion, but
I think that that's faulty.</p>
<p t="2752610" d="3970">I thought this way in part because of Piaget
[Jean Piaget, 1896-1980], you know, because</p>
<p t="2756580" d="4900">Piaget was interested in what the intrinsic
constraints were on a social contract, and</p>
<p t="2761480" d="8180">he said … and he was trying to address this
issue of the insufficiency of want as a tool</p>
<p t="2769660" d="5630">to justify your claims to truth. That's
when he introduced the idea of the equilibrated</p>
<p t="2775290" d="6680">state. So, if you're sophisticated, you
have to put forward your want and then meet</p>
<p t="2781970" d="7710">it in a way that will meet it today, and tomorrow,
and next month, and next year, and in a decade—so</p>
<p t="2789680" d="5960">you have to iterate yourself across time,
and you have to take all of the iterations</p>
<p t="2795640" d="5010">of yourself across time with some degree of
seriousness, and then you also have to do</p>
<p t="2800650" d="3820">the same thing as you extend yourself out
into the social community. So it has to be</p>
<p t="2804470" d="6190">“what's good for me now” and repetitively
into the future in a manner that's simultaneously</p>
<p t="2810660" d="2940">good for you now and simultaneously into the
future.</p>
<p t="2813600" d="1000">Uh huh.</p>
<p t="2814600" d="3480">And that starts to become … and he thought
about that as “the playable game,” something</p>
<p t="2818080" d="4140">like that. The “voluntarily playable game.”
And there's something deep about that, because</p>
<p t="2822220" d="4840">it includes the idea of iteration, you know,
iterated interpretations into the equation,</p>
<p t="2827060" d="2700">which strikes me as of crucial importance.</p>
<p t="2829760" d="9420">Okay, yes, right? Again, I count about six
very interesting sub-topics built into that,</p>
<p t="2839180" d="5860">and the latter part is a very nice statement
I think of a kind of Enlightenment humanism</p>
<p t="2845040" d="6201">where we're going to take power seriously,
but we're going to constrain power in a</p>
<p t="2851241" d="6739">way that respects the individual and simultaneously
enables individuals to form mutually beneficial</p>
<p t="2857980" d="5700">social networks across time, and so on.</p>
<p t="2863680" d="7620">And I'm very sympathetic to that overall
construction. And that comes out of then the</p>
<p t="2871300" d="2690">first part which is a taxonomy [taxonomy:
the science or technique of classification]</p>
<p t="2873990" d="5230">you're offering about the nature of power—and
that taxonomy does differ significantly from</p>
<p t="2879220" d="3200">both the Marxist and the Nietzschean ones.</p>
<p t="2882420" d="8830">Now what I'd say is that I think it's
better to take power more neutrally so there's</p>
<p t="2891250" d="3930">a continuity with what the physicists do.
And my understanding there is that power is</p>
<p t="2895180" d="3590">just the ability to get work done.</p>
<p t="2898770" d="2380">Uh hmm.</p>
<p t="2901150" d="7230">So you can put that in tool and functionality
language: Power is what gets you from A to</p>
<p t="2908380" d="1000">B.</p>
<p t="2909380" d="4590">Right, right. Which is also … I love that
description, because it fits very nicely in</p>
<p t="2913970" d="5040">with the narrative conceptualization of being,
because narratives seem to be descriptions</p>
<p t="2919010" d="3060">of something like “How to get from point
A to point B.”</p>
<p t="2922070" d="6730">Right. But it also doesn't say anything
about B and the status of B: How we choose</p>
<p t="2928800" d="5930">where we should be going, what our ends are,
or what our goals are—so in that sense power</p>
<p t="2934730" d="8310">is normatively neutral—it's a means to
an end, and that means when we try to evaluate</p>
<p t="2943040" d="7760">the uses of power, we're going to be evaluating
power in terms of the ends toward which it</p>
<p t="2950800" d="5190">is put, if I can end with that preposition
there.</p>
<p t="2955990" d="5250">So now … Then we say: Okay, well, power
comes in all kinds of forms. I'm quite happy</p>
<p t="2961240" d="5360">to say that there's intellectual power:
that's the ability to use our minds to address</p>
<p t="2966600" d="6380">and solve certain problems. There's muscular
power: the ability to move physical objects.</p>
<p t="2972980" d="5760">There's social power: people respect you
and are willing to spend time with you and</p>
<p t="2978740" d="4280">divert resources to you voluntarily, and so
forth. There's military power; political</p>
<p t="2983020" d="5810">power—and so we can have a whole set of
subspecies of power. And what they all have</p>
<p t="2988830" d="5140">then in common is in each of those domains
there are goals, and having the power enables</p>
<p t="2993970" d="3160">you to achieve your goals in those domains.</p>
<p t="2997130" d="5620">Right, and we shouldn't fall prey to the
illusion that there's necessarily any—like,</p>
<p t="3002750" d="4550">what would you call it—“unifying matrix”
that makes all those different forms of power</p>
<p t="3007300" d="5960">importantly similar except for the terminology,
you know? I mean—and this is another thing</p>
<p t="3013260" d="4580">that bothers me about both the Nietzschean
and the Marxist view, is that there's this</p>
<p t="3017840" d="6220">proclivity to collapse these multiple modes
of power into power itself, and that's not</p>
<p t="3024060" d="5280">reasonable because it's reasonable to note
that many of the forms of power that you just</p>
<p t="3029340" d="5190">described contend against one another, rather
than mutually fortify one another. It's</p>
<p t="3034530" d="4000">like the balance of power in a polity like
the American polity.</p>
<p t="3038530" d="5040">Yes, I think that's a deep point that you're
making, and I think that both the Marxists</p>
<p t="3043570" d="7299">and the Nietzscheans do end up collapsing
power into a unitary type, and that's a</p>
<p t="3050869" d="7401">mistake. But it's a mistake only if you
deny, as both the Marxists and the Nietzscheans</p>
<p t="3058270" d="7530">do, that there is a deep individuality about
the world. So if you think, by contrast, about</p>
<p t="3065800" d="6220">the kind of individual human-rights-respecting
Enlightenment vision that you're articulating,</p>
<p t="3072020" d="8290">and that I agree with as well: normatively
that wants to devolve social power to the</p>
<p t="3080310" d="6650">individual, and leave individuals with a great
deal of self-responsibility and control over</p>
<p t="3086960" d="5810">their own domain so to speak. And the idea
then is that if we're going to form social</p>
<p t="3092770" d="6450">relationships, or any sort of social interaction,
it has to be mutually respecting: that I have</p>
<p t="3099220" d="5980">to respect your control over your domain and
you respect my control over my domain, but</p>
<p t="3105200" d="4270">we agree to share domains, so to speak, voluntarily
to a certain point.</p>
<p t="3109470" d="5880">It also means—and this is a place where
I think the postmodernists are really open</p>
<p t="3115350" d="7250">to, you might say, conceptual assault—is
that you know, in order to have that freedom</p>
<p t="3122600" d="4040">devolve upon the individual in that manner,
it also means that the individual has to take</p>
<p t="3126640" d="1000">responsibility …</p>
<p t="3127640" d="1000">Right.</p>
<p t="3128640" d="5110">… for acting as a locus of power in the
world, actual responsibility, and cannot conceive</p>
<p t="3133750" d="4300">of themselves or act in a manner that only
makes them an avatar of a social movement.</p>
<p t="3138050" d="7210">And I think that part of the perfervid anti-individualism
of the radical Left is precisely predicated</p>
<p t="3145260" d="4290">on that refusal to take responsibility, and
I think that's also reflected in the fact</p>
<p t="3149550" d="4520">that, by temperament, they're low in “trait
conscientiousness,” so it's deep, it's</p>
<p t="3154070" d="4610">not merely an opinion; it's an expression
of something that's even deeper than opinion.</p>
<p t="3158680" d="4950">Okay, yes, that phrase “locus of responsibility,”
“locus of power,” “locus of control”—you're</p>
<p t="3163630" d="8660">right that the far Left in Marxist and Neo-Marxist
form does deny that, but you also find that</p>
<p t="3172290" d="1290">in the far Right …</p>
<p t="3173580" d="2789">Yes, you find that among ideologues in general.</p>
<p t="3176369" d="5421">Right. So this is a bit of cartoon intellectual
history, but then if you try to trace it to</p>
<p t="3181790" d="5520">the Marxists on the Left and the Nietzscheans
on the Right, both of them do deny that individuals</p>
<p t="3187310" d="6290">are loci of responsibility. Both of them in
their views of human nature have strongly</p>
<p t="3193600" d="7370">deterministic views. What we can an “individual,”
according to both of them, is just a “vehicle”</p>
<p t="3200970" d="2690">through which “outside forces are flowing,”
so to speak. [Determinism: the doctrine that</p>
<p t="3203660" d="2150">all events, including human action, are ultimately
determined by causes external to the will.</p>
<p t="3205810" d="1000">Some philosophers have taken determinism to
imply that human beings have no free will</p>
<p t="3206810" d="1000">and cannot be held morally responsible for
their actions.]</p>
<p t="3207810" d="3530">Right. Well, you can also see that in some
sense as a perverse consequence of the scientific</p>
<p t="3211340" d="1000">revolution …</p>
<p t="3212340" d="1000">Yes.</p>
<p t="3213340" d="2529">…because you still see this among modern
scientists: It's like, “Okay, what are</p>
<p t="3215869" d="5301">the causal forces that regulate human behavior?
Okay, there's two primary sources: Nature/biology</p>
<p t="3221170" d="1270">and culture.”</p>
<p t="3222440" d="5780">So it's the crude “Nature vs. Nurture”
debate being played out through them, yes.</p>
<p t="3228220" d="8260">Right! And so in my opinion—and I've derived
this conclusion from studying mythology, mostly—there's</p>
<p t="3236480" d="5830">a missing third element there which is whatever
it is that constitutes the active force of</p>
<p t="3242310" d="4891">individual consciousness. And we don't have
a good conceptual schema for that.</p>
<p t="3247201" d="7629">Right, self-responsibility and being an independent
initiator of power instead of merely a responder</p>
<p t="3254830" d="5090">to other power forces, or a vehicle through
which those other power forces operate.</p>
<p t="3259920" d="1000">Right.</p>
<p t="3260920" d="6071">So yes, the individualism that is built into
Enlightenment humanism—you start to see</p>
<p t="3266991" d="5529">it developing in Renaissance humanism—is
to take seriously the notion that individuals</p>
<p t="3272520" d="6690">have some significant measure of control over
their thoughts, over their actions, to shape</p>
<p t="3279210" d="1000">their own character …</p>
<p t="3280210" d="1000">Right!</p>
<p t="3281210" d="4510">… to shape their own destinies, and that
that is fundamental to one's moral dignity</p>
<p t="3285720" d="10080">as a human being. And so that view of human
nature is built into the ethics fundamentally,</p>
<p t="3295800" d="5500">and then all of social relationships have
to be respectful of that individuality, and</p>
<p t="3301300" d="4390">then, consequently, when we start to turn
to political theory and we talk about very</p>
<p t="3305690" d="6600">heavy-duty uses of power, such as the police
and the military—we want to have serious</p>
<p t="3312290" d="6390">constraints on government power to make sure
that we are respecting individual sovereignty.</p>
<p t="3318680" d="7260">Okay. And here's something perverse, too,
that emerges as a consequence of something</p>
<p t="3325940" d="4460">you pointed out earlier in the conversation,
you know. You mentioned that when Modernism</p>
<p t="3330400" d="5360">emerged out of Medievalism, that two things
happened. One was the elaboration of the conceptual</p>
<p t="3335760" d="4720">frames that enabled us to deal with the external
world. But the other was the elevation of</p>
<p t="3340480" d="5180">the individual to the status of valid critic,
predicated on the idea that there was something</p>
<p t="3345660" d="3260">actually valid about individual experience
as such.</p>
<p t="3348920" d="4710">Now the problem there, as far as I can tell—and
maybe this is part of the reason we're in</p>
<p t="3353630" d="6690">this conundrum—is that the elaboration of
the objective scientific viewpoint left us</p>
<p t="3360320" d="4660">with the idea that it was either “nature”
or “nurture” that was the source of human</p>
<p t="3364980" d="1580">motive power.</p>
<p t="3366560" d="4421">But the missing element there is: Well, if
that's the case, then why grant to the individual</p>
<p t="3370981" d="3669">to begin with the role of independent social
critic?</p>
<p t="3374650" d="1000">Exactly.</p>
<p t="3375650" d="6070">Like, on what grounds do you … It's like
a residual belief in something like the autonomy</p>
<p t="3381720" d="5760">of the soul, which you can't just sneak
in and not justify, without problems! Like</p>
<p t="3387480" d="1000">the ones that we have now!</p>
<p t="3388480" d="6629">Yes. Now that's well put. And I think it's
fair to say that we still are in the infancy</p>
<p t="3395109" d="5411">of the psychological sciences—you can speak
to this better than I can—but as someone</p>
<p t="3400520" d="4720">in philosophy, I think we're still at the
beginnings. And we are still in the grip of</p>
<p t="3405240" d="7870">early and crude versions of scientific understandings
of how cause and effect operates. So what</p>
<p t="3413110" d="6190">we are starting with is very mechanical understandings,
and we can understand how people then are</p>
<p t="3419300" d="4220">pushed around by biological forces. We can
understand to some extent how they're pushed</p>
<p t="3423520" d="5190">around by external physical and mechanical
forces. But we do not yet have a sophisticated</p>
<p t="3428710" d="4810">enough understanding of the human brain, the
human mind, human psychology, to understand</p>
<p t="3433520" d="7460">how a volitional consciousness can be a causal
force, a causal power in the world.</p>
<p t="3440980" d="5280">Right. That's perfectly well put. So, I
do a detailed analysis that some of the people</p>
<p t="3446260" d="5040">who watch me are familiar with, of this movie
“Pinocchio,” and Pinocchio has got a very</p>
<p t="3451300" d="5799">classical mythological structure, and it basically
introduces three elements of being: so there's</p>
<p t="3457099" d="4651">(1) the element of being that's associated
with Geppetto; and also (2) the evil tyrannical</p>
<p t="3461750" d="4880">forces that are kind of patriarchal in nature,
and that's sort of the “conceptualization</p>
<p t="3466630" d="4200">of society”—a benevolent element and a
malevolent element, say. And then there's</p>
<p t="3470830" d="4480">(3) the introduction of this other causal
factor and it's personified in the form</p>
<p t="3475310" d="5950">of the Blue Fairy. The Blue Fairy is a manifestation
of Mother Nature, and she animates Pinocchio.</p>
<p t="3481260" d="5470">So Geppetto creates him, and then sets up
a wish for his independence, and then Nature</p>
<p t="3486730" d="4360">appears in the guise of the Blue Fairy and
grants that wish. So you have “culture”</p>
<p t="3491090" d="6380">and “nature” conspiring to produce a puppet
that could in fact disentangle itself from</p>
<p t="3497470" d="5180">its strings. But the movie insists—and it
does this on profound mythological grounds—that</p>
<p t="3502650" d="5340">the puppet itself has a causal role to play
in its own … what would you call it … in</p>
<p t="3507990" d="7020">its own capacity to transcend the deterministic
chains, the deterministic processes which</p>
<p t="3515010" d="2480">have given rise to it, that also enslave it.</p>
<p t="3517490" d="1000">Um hmm.</p>
<p t="3518490" d="4591">You know in all of our profound narratives,
I would say—and this is part of the way</p>
<p t="3523081" d="4469">that they differ from the scientific account—there's
always that third element. There's always</p>
<p t="3527550" d="5960">the autonomous individual who is, in some
sense, you know, lifting himself up by his</p>
<p t="3533510" d="1000">own bootstraps.</p>
<p t="3534510" d="1000">Yes…</p>
<p t="3535510" d="4600">And I don't think it's a problem that
science is unable to account for, but it's</p>
<p t="3540110" d="5920">a very big problem when scientists who are
unable to account for that deny that it exists,</p>
<p t="3546030" d="3010">because they can't explain it. That becomes
extraordinarily dangerous.</p>
<p t="3549040" d="7340">Right. Yes. Once you stop looking, you stop
trying, right? Then you're left with an</p>
<p t="3556380" d="6070">impoverished account. So in a way, there's
a kind of hubris built into the skepticism</p>
<p t="3562450" d="5210">that says, “I know that this is a problem
that we just can't solve, so I'm not going</p>
<p t="3567660" d="1910">to try anymore.”</p>
<p t="3569570" d="6440">Yeah, well there's a performative contradiction
as well, which is much worth pointing out—because</p>
<p t="3576010" d="5010">on the one hand, the scientist might well
claim, “As far as I'm concerned, from</p>
<p t="3581020" d="5610">an epistemological perspective, the only two
causal forces are ‘nature' and ‘culture.'</p>
<p t="3586630" d="5060">But then I'll go about my actions in the
normative world, as an existential being,</p>
<p t="3591690" d="5810">acting in the world, and I will swallow whole-heartedly
the proposition that ‘each individual is</p>
<p t="3597500" d="3880">responsible for his own actions'—because
that's how I constantly interact with everyone</p>
<p t="3601380" d="3630">in the world. And I get very irritated if
they violate that principle.”</p>
<p t="3605010" d="7270">Yes, right. So how you live with your skepticism
or your relativism in a way that doesn't</p>
<p t="3612280" d="4780">ensnarl you in tensions and contradictions—that's
a hard project itself.</p>
<p t="3617060" d="8190">Well, it does seem to me, I think it's reasonable
to point out that it's not possible to find</p>
<p t="3625250" d="6040">a person who acts as if he or anyone else
is “biologically or culturally determined.”</p>
<p t="3631290" d="4140">We just don't behave that way in the real
world. We act as if we're responsible for</p>
<p t="3635430" d="2590">our own actions, and the consequences of those
actions.</p>
<p t="3638020" d="3370">Right. So then we have a tension between what
our “intellectual theories” are telling</p>
<p t="3641390" d="7170">us, and what our kind of “empirical data”
is telling us—we don't have a way to put</p>
<p t="3648560" d="5130">those two together, and then what you as an
individual do in response to that tension</p>
<p t="3653690" d="5310">between theory and practice—that's a whole
other can of things to explore.</p>
<p t="3659000" d="1000">Right.</p>
<p t="3660000" d="7670">But to back up to our discussion about power—
It's interesting that the way our discussion,</p>
<p t="3667670" d="6640">up to that point, then integrates three things:
(1) We started talking about truth, and then</p>
<p t="3674310" d="8210">(2) we started talking about goals and normative
ends and ideals, and then (3) we talk about</p>
<p t="3682520" d="1000">power.</p>
<p t="3683520" d="6240">So there we've got already the big three:
Truth, Ideals, and Power.</p>
<p t="3689760" d="6740">Our discussion about Truth took us into epistemological
issues in philosophy; our discussion about</p>
<p t="3696500" d="6220">Ideals takes us into ethics and meta-ethics
issues and also into philosophy; and our discussion</p>
<p t="3702720" d="5980">of Power takes us into issues about human
nature, all of which traditionally comprise</p>
<p t="3708700" d="2720">a branch of philosophy and its sub-disciplines.</p>
<p t="3711420" d="5060">So we already have to have a theory of epistemology
[epistemology: the theory of knowledge, especially</p>
<p t="3716480" d="1000">with regard to its methods, validity and scope:
the investigation of what distinguishes justified</p>
<p t="3717480" d="2990">belief from opinion]; a theory of human nature;
a theory of ethics—and we can sometimes</p>
<p t="3720470" d="6250">try to integrate those—and postmodernism
is going to be an integration of certain views</p>
<p t="3726720" d="3590">that develop in philosophical traditions in
all three of those areas.</p>
<p t="3730310" d="8870">So maybe one way to put it is this: If you
contrast it to kind of a—again, taking the</p>
<p t="3739180" d="6159">Enlightenment as our touchstone—I think
we're both fans of the Enlightenment—we</p>
<p t="3745339" d="8181">say: All right, we're fine with power. Knowledge
is power, and we want to empower the individual.</p>
<p t="3753520" d="6079">We want to eliminate slavery and empower people.
We want to eliminate old-fashioned sexism</p>
<p t="3759599" d="3500">and empower women. So power is…</p>
<p t="3763099" d="5531">Yes, we actually want to remove arbitrary
and unnecessary impediments to the expression</p>
<p t="3768630" d="1000">of proper power.</p>
<p t="3769630" d="6680">That's right. So there are illegitimate
uses of power that are stopping and disempowering</p>
<p t="3776310" d="5790">people. So it's the double-edged sword.
And as long as power is properly directed</p>
<p t="3782100" d="6170">or properly located, then we are confident
that, by and large, people individually and</p>
<p t="3788270" d="7390">socially will use their power to put together
useful lives, build successful economies and</p>
<p t="3795660" d="1000">societies, and so forth.</p>
<p t="3796660" d="9270">So it's actually a very optimistic overall
assessment about power. But power is then</p>
<p t="3805930" d="6679">structured as a means to an end: we want to
empower people cognitively—teach them how</p>
<p t="3812609" d="7081">to read, teach them how to think, so that
they themselves can understand the truth and</p>
<p t="3819690" d="3990">discover new truths. So “power leads to
truth.”</p>
<p t="3823680" d="10490">But we also then want people to be free to
act on the basis of their power, because then</p>
<p t="3834170" d="4980">we think that if people are respected as individual
agents, they're going to be happier and</p>
<p t="3839150" d="7750">so they will achieve good goals, and they
will mutually work out together fair agreements</p>
<p t="3846900" d="5620">and deals— a kind of “justice,” right?
Society will get better and better, and so</p>
<p t="3852520" d="1000">forth.</p>
<p t="3853520" d="7770">So power is in the service of just social
relations, and power is in the service of</p>
<p t="3861290" d="1000">truth.</p>
<p t="3862290" d="6950">Yes, so now that's a great “justification,”
say, for the Enlightenment viewpoint, and</p>
<p t="3869240" d="5580">it seems—I don't want to stop you from
pursuing that—but it also seems to me that,</p>
<p t="3874820" d="6100">to the degree that that's true (a valid
description of the Enlightenment aims), and</p>
<p t="3880920" d="5460">to the degree that that has actually manifested
itself in reality in the current state of</p>
<p t="3886380" d="7670">human affairs, that it's perhaps unwise
of us to allow our Marxist or our Nietzschean</p>
<p t="3894050" d="6342">presuppositions to take too careless a swing
at that foundation, given that it's actually</p>
<p t="3900392" d="4078">…
Absolutely right, and that's why the Enlightenment</p>
<p t="3904470" d="5980">articulation “Power is good if it's in
the service of truth”— or “Power is</p>
<p t="3910450" d="5360">good if it's in the service of justice”—then
we're fine. And we're optimistic enough</p>
<p t="3915810" d="5220">about human beings, cognitively and morally,
that we think that “empowering” them—</p>
<p t="3921030" d="4670">giving them lots of freedoms— is going to
increase the net stock of truth, and it's</p>
<p t="3925700" d="4390">going to increase the net stock of justice.
So that entire “Enlightenment package”</p>
<p t="3930090" d="6800">is precisely what the Counter-Enlightenment
attacks. It attacked very fundamentally so</p>
<p t="3936890" d="5940">that by the time we get two to three generations
later— to the generations of Marx and Nietzsche—</p>
<p t="3942830" d="4550">it has been hollowed out.
So on the epistemological side we don't</p>
<p t="3947380" d="5850">believe that there is such a thing as “truth”
anymore. So it's not the case that “power”</p>
<p t="3953230" d="5480">is in the search of “truth,” because we
don't believe that human beings are capable</p>
<p t="3958710" d="4690">of getting to any sort of objective truth
anymore. So we're just left with “power.”</p>
<p t="3963400" d="4810">And also on the normative side, we don't
believe in “justice” anymore. We don't</p>
<p t="3968210" d="7930">believe that any sort of normative principles
or ethical ideals can be objectively grounded.</p>
<p t="3976140" d="4761">And so then, once again, maybe we're left
with subjective desires and so forth, but</p>
<p t="3980901" d="2029">we're just left again with “power.”</p>
<p t="3982930" d="4790">So power in the service of Truth; power in
the service of Justice: that goes away. All</p>
<p t="3987720" d="1000">that we are left with is Power.</p>
<p t="3988720" d="8440">Okay, so then we could mount a psycho-analytic
critique of that set of objections. Because</p>
<p t="3997160" d="11780">I could say, Okay, here's some reasons.
Let's assume you're doing something simple</p>
<p t="4008940" d="5030">and easy instead of complicated and difficult
with your objections. And so here's the</p>
<p t="4013970" d="2899">simple and easy explanation:</p>
<p t="4016869" d="4411">You want to dispense with the idea of “justice”
and “truth” because that lightens your</p>
<p t="4021280" d="4040">existential load because now there's nothing
difficult and noble that you have to strive</p>
<p t="4025320" d="4370">for, and you want to reduce everything to
“power” because that justifies your use</p>
<p t="4029690" d="7179">of power in your pursuit of those immediate
goals that you no longer even have to justify</p>
<p t="4036869" d="4591">because you don't have to make reference
to any higher standards of, say, “justice”</p>
<p t="4041460" d="8420">or “truth.” And so I would say: That's
a deep, impulsive and resentful nihilism that's</p>
<p t="4049880" d="2600">manifesting itself as a glorious intellectual
critique. [Nihilism: a viewpoint that traditional</p>
<p t="4052480" d="1060">values and beliefs are unfounded and that
existence is senseless and useless.]</p>
<p t="4053540" d="5870">Now, I understand as well that there is the
history of genuine intellectual critique that</p>
<p t="4059410" d="4540">you've been laying out, which is not trivial—
but those things have to be differentiated,</p>
<p t="4063950" d="4710">you know. It's certainly not reasonable
either for those who claim that “all there</p>
<p t="4068660" d="4990">is is power,” that they're not themselves
motivated equally by that power.</p>
<p t="4073650" d="5130">Sure. So in one way, all right, what you can
always say, in effect, is that philosophy</p>
<p t="4078780" d="5610">is autobiographical. In many cases philosophers
will put their pronouncements in third-person</p>
<p t="4084390" d="5510">form, or in generalized form, but if you always
put it down to third-person formulations,</p>
<p t="4089900" d="3480">it can be profoundly self-revelatory.</p>
<p t="4093380" d="5540">So if you say, for example, “Human beings
are scum”—there you have some sort of</p>
<p t="4098920" d="5350">a pessimistic assessment of the human condition.
Well, built into that then is the idea that</p>
<p t="4104270" d="4000">I, if I “first-personalize it,” that “I
am scum.” What you're really doing is</p>
<p t="4108270" d="6630">a first-person confession. And it's always
then an illegitimate move to exempt yourself</p>
<p t="4114900" d="2369">from the general principle.</p>
<p t="4117269" d="1000">Right.</p>
<p t="4118269" d="8800">Or: “Everything just is “power relations”
and “people imposing their agendas on other</p>
<p t="4127069" d="5000">people.” Then what you're saying is: “Well,
my fundamental commitment is power, and I</p>
<p t="4132069" d="3300">just want to impose my agenda on other people.”</p>
<p t="4135369" d="4611">So I do think you're right— that it can
go both ways: It can of course be that you</p>
<p t="4139980" d="7509">have people who, for whatever reason, have
a predisposition to nihilistic, amoral power</p>
<p t="4147489" d="9071">seeking, and when they become adults and “intellectual,”
they latch onto theories that indulge them,</p>
<p t="4156560" d="2519">that enable them to rationalize their predispositions.</p>
<p t="4159079" d="7211">And so in many cases, yes, a lot of Postmodernism,
in some of its manifestations, is disingenuous</p>
<p t="4166290" d="7380">in that form. People don't necessarily buy
into the postmodern philosophical framework,</p>
<p t="4173670" d="7609">but rather, in kind of pragmatic form, Postmodernism
as a set of “tools” is useful for them</p>
<p t="4181279" d="5380">to advance their own personal and social agendas,
whatever those happen to be.</p>
<p t="4186659" d="8431">Okay. So let's switch a little bit. Let's
switch over into that a little bit. I've</p>
<p t="4195090" d="4759">found our discussion extremely useful on the
philosophical end, but now I would like to</p>
<p t="4199849" d="2870">make it a bit more personal, if you don't
mind.</p>
<p t="4202719" d="2230">You're written this book Explaining Postmodernism:
Skepticism and Socialism from Rousseau to</p>
<p t="4204949" d="6290">Foucault. And it's a fairly “punchy,”
let's say, critique of Postmodernism and</p>
<p t="4211239" d="6261">its alliance with Neo-Marxism. And you've
done a careful job of laying out the historical</p>
<p t="4217500" d="5060">development of both of those movements and
their alliance.</p>
<p t="4222560" d="8520">(1) What was your motivation for doing that;
and what have you experienced as a consequence</p>
<p t="4231080" d="5240">(1) of writing the book, and (2) as a consequence
of being a professor who's in the midst</p>
<p t="4236320" d="5810">of an academic society that's basically
running on postmodern principles?</p>
<p t="4242130" d="6650">[laughs] Yes, that's a good trio of questions
there. Well, my motivations for writing the</p>
<p t="4248780" d="10370">book were: One, as an intellectual exercise:
here was a movement that was complex, many</p>
<p t="4259150" d="6829">philosophical and cultural strands coming
together, and I enjoy intellectual history</p>
<p t="4265979" d="5740">very much—so it was a pleasure for me to
read back into the histories and to tease</p>
<p t="4271719" d="4780">out all of the lines of developments, and
how things were packaged and repackaged—so</p>
<p t="4276499" d="7821">that the postmodern synthesis (as it came
together in the second third of the 20th century)</p>
<p t="4284320" d="10379">came into being. As a purely intellectual
historical enterprise, I found that fulfilling.</p>
<p t="4294699" d="7090">Partly also this was the 1990s, late 1990s,
it's end of the Cold War. One of the things</p>
<p t="4301789" d="5631">I had done—not professionally, but just
out of personal interest—was read a lot</p>
<p t="4307420" d="5989">of political philosophy, read a lot about
the Cold War and the intellectual developments—and</p>
<p t="4313409" d="4431">call it political developments—that had
gone on there. So I had a very good, I'd</p>
<p t="4317840" d="6330">say, amateur working knowledge, before I started
researching the book, about the history of</p>
<p t="4324170" d="3829">Marxism and the history of Cold War geo-politics.</p>
<p t="4327999" d="5271">And sort of one of the big questions on everyone's
mind of course in the late 1990s with the</p>
<p t="4333270" d="4679">fall of the Soviet Union and the end of the
Cold War is: What's going to happen next?</p>
<p t="4337949" d="4061">So what's the new geo-political alignment
going to be?</p>
<p t="4342010" d="8100">Then from my academic position, the big question
inside the intellectual word is: Since far-left</p>
<p t="4350110" d="8949">politics had been so prominent and that for
generations, intellectuals inside the academic</p>
<p t="4359059" d="6420">world had largely given the benefit of the
doubt to far-leftist experiments—even going</p>
<p t="4365479" d="6381">out of their way to be fellow travelers, and
so forth—that by the time you get to the</p>
<p t="4371860" d="7410">end of the Cold War, basically everybody,
except for a few true believers, is rethinking.</p>
<p t="4379270" d="5269">So what does this mean for—not necessarily
left politics more broadly, but certainly</p>
<p t="4384539" d="8270">for far-left politics? And so even the far-leftists
of the leftists are recognizing that they're</p>
<p t="4392809" d="5810">going to have to come up with some sort of
a new strategy in order to remain intellectually</p>
<p t="4398619" d="6790">respectable, and some sort of a new strategy
in order to become culturally and politically</p>
<p t="4405409" d="1290">feasible.</p>
<p t="4406699" d="7040">So I did have a kind of a cultural/political
interest in what the thinking was on the far</p>
<p t="4413739" d="5881">left about what they're going to do now
that the Soviet Union has collapsed and the</p>
<p t="4419620" d="6280">whole world is shifting more toward a market
liberalism or to some sort of “third way”</p>
<p t="4425900" d="1000">centrism.</p>
<p t="4426900" d="3750">Yeah, and now that all the corpses have floated
up on the beach, so to speak …</p>
<p t="4430650" d="5190">Right. Yes! So you have a huge then amount
of empirical data that you have to confront</p>
<p t="4435840" d="5890">and…Now, I think this is going to be part
of the postmodern package, but there's a</p>
<p t="4441730" d="6469">lot of denial of the relevance of empiricism;
there's a lot of denial of the relevance</p>
<p t="4448199" d="6341">of logic and social-scientific statistical
methods of aggregating that data and reaching</p>
<p t="4454540" d="4699">normative conclusions on the basis of that.
So we can understand the temptation on the</p>
<p t="4459239" d="6521">part of a lot of people to find psychological
devices that will enable them to deny the</p>
<p t="4465760" d="6489">Gulag and the various other horrible things.
By the time the 90s …</p>
<p t="4472249" d="6680">Right. When the facts, as even you [of the
left] would have construed them, are stacking</p>
<p t="4478929" d="5540">up viciously in contradiction to your theory,
it's time to mount an all-out assault on</p>
<p t="4484469" d="1621">what constitutes a “fact.”</p>
<p t="4486090" d="4279">Okay, that's one strategy, and that's
again one of the sub-strategies I think that</p>
<p t="4490369" d="7340">postmoderns will use. So, if you then have
philosophers and social scientists, and people</p>
<p t="4497709" d="4641">who are up to speed in their epistemology,
who are telling you, Well, you know, there</p>
<p t="4502350" d="4959">are just different narratives that are out
there, and there are no such things as objective</p>
<p t="4507309" d="6040">facts, and logic does not necessarily point
us in one direction: there are “poly-logics”</p>
<p t="4513349" d="4600">or “multiple frameworks”—then if you
have one “framework” that says, “No.</p>
<p t="4517949" d="7161">There are objective facts and the logic is
all going against your version of political</p>
<p t="4525110" d="3900">idealism,” then it's going to be very
tempting for you to say, “Well, I can just</p>
<p t="4529010" d="5129">dismiss that as just one narrative way of
constructing the historical facts: I can come</p>
<p t="4534139" d="3971">up with a different narrative that softens
or denies altogether …”</p>
<p t="4538110" d="5619">And certainly some of the bad-faith postmodernists
do go down that road very much.</p>
<p t="4543729" d="3600">So in part that was my motivation for writing
the book.</p>
<p t="4547329" d="7810">And in part I did feel that I was in a good
position intellectually to do so because my</p>
<p t="4555139" d="6261">Ph.D. work had been in logic, philosophy of
science and epistemology, so I was up to speed</p>
<p t="4561400" d="8259">on the entire history of epistemology from
the modern world on through the way things</p>
<p t="4569659" d="5790">were in the 80s and the early 1990s. So I
was reading the same people that Rorty had.</p>
<p t="4575449" d="6081">I have to say I learned an enormous amount
from reading Richard Rorty. He's first rate,</p>
<p t="4581530" d="5930">even though I end up disagreeing fundamentally
with him about everything … Foucault's</p>
<p t="4587460" d="5950">Ph.D. also was in philosophy; he also had
a Ph.D. in psychology. Derrida—another philosophy</p>
<p t="4593410" d="6870">Ph.D. Lyotard—another philosophy Ph.D. So,
not necessarily putting myself on the same</p>
<p t="4600280" d="7360">stature intellectually, but all of us, so
to speak, are first-rate educated in epistemology.</p>
<p t="4607640" d="4360">So I know where they're coming from and
where all of that is going.</p>
<p t="4612000" d="7079">At the same time, my undergraduate and master's
degree at Guelph (just down the road from</p>
<p t="4619079" d="7361">you) in history of philosophy—so I had a
long-standing passion for how arguments and</p>
<p t="4626440" d="7750">movements develop over time, so I thought
I was in a good position to see how postmodernism</p>
<p t="4634190" d="5460">had evolved out of various other earlier movements
that had developed over time—and I am enough</p>
<p t="4639650" d="6279">of a political animal to be interested in
political philosophy. And I believe that abstract</p>
<p t="4645929" d="4900">philosophical theory, when it gets put into
practice, makes life-and-death practical differences</p>
<p t="4650829" d="1000">…</p>
<p t="4651829" d="5690">So the stakes are high. So I was motivated
then to put it all together: How does the</p>
<p t="4657519" d="5561">history and the philosophy and the politics
all come together in Postmodernism? So I wrote</p>
<p t="4663080" d="1000">the book.</p>
<p t="4664080" d="8579">Now, yes. How it has affected me personally
in academic life. Well, let me see. In one</p>
<p t="4672659" d="6250">way I think I was fortunate that I had tenure
by the time the book was published, and my</p>
<p t="4678909" d="5840">university is by and large a tolerant place.
We have some issues here, but by and large</p>
<p t="4684749" d="9091">my colleagues are reasonable, decent people,
and at least I was able to get tenure on the</p>
<p t="4693840" d="7560">strength of my teaching abilities and my publication.
And so it wasn't that I was going to lose</p>
<p t="4701400" d="2529">my job over this.</p>
<p t="4703929" d="5071">But of course there is blowback. I did have
difficulty getting the book published in the</p>
<p t="4709000" d="6449">first place. Actually I finished writing the
book by the year 2000. I had taken a sabbatical</p>
<p t="4715449" d="5480">from 1999-2000 and wrote the book then, but
I was not able to get the book published until</p>
<p t="4720929" d="9300">2004, and the reason for that was a number
of “desk rejections”—you know, the editor</p>
<p t="4730229" d="5000">just sends a form letter back. I got a few
of those. But, more seriously, what happened</p>
<p t="4735229" d="5250">three times, possibly four times, I don't
remember exactly now, was it would get past</p>
<p t="4740479" d="6000">the editor at the press, and then it would
be sent out to two or three reviewers—and</p>
<p t="4746479" d="6200">in each case what happened was I would get
split and polarized-split reviews. One would</p>
<p t="4752679" d="5230">come back and say, “This is a really good
book; he's done his homework, it's a good</p>
<p t="4757909" d="4320">argument, it's a fresh argument … I don't
necessarily agree with all of it, but this</p>
<p t="4762229" d="5870">really ought to be out there as a book”;
and then the other review on the other side</p>
<p t="4768099" d="5491">would be equally savaging: “This is a terrible
book; he doesn't know his history of philosophy,</p>
<p t="4773590" d="4699">he's butchered this that and the other thing,
and I strongly recommend that you don't</p>
<p t="4778289" d="6450">publish this book.” And then almost always
in that situation, the editor just says, “No.”</p>
<p t="4784739" d="8292">So it wasn't until late 2003, early 2004,
that Scholargy Publishing, which was then</p>
<p t="4793031" d="6338">a small press working out of Arizona, took
the book on, and I'm happy to say that after</p>
<p t="4799369" d="3551">it was published, it's been in print consistently
since then.</p>
<p t="4802920" d="1670">Yes, that's remarkable. That's remarkable.</p>
<p t="4804590" d="2339">Yes, so I'm very happy about that …</p>
<p t="4806929" d="2670">For any book, let alone an academic book.</p>
<p t="4809599" d="5781">Yes, and then multiple translations, and those
continue, so I'm happy about that.</p>
<p t="4815380" d="8549">Now I'd say the scholarly responses have
been from moderate liberals: so kind of traditional</p>
<p t="4823929" d="6770">… don't necessarily want to use the word
“traditional,” but from rational, naturalistic,</p>
<p t="4830699" d="6650">liberal thinkers, conservatives and libertarians:
the reviews have all been strong, and strongly</p>
<p t="4837349" d="1000">positive.</p>
<p t="4838349" d="9400">But I have not received any formal reviews
from any of the postmodern or far-left journals,</p>
<p t="4847749" d="5080">so I'm not sure what that means, but there
is, at least at some level, an unwillingness</p>
<p t="4852829" d="1000">to engage ...</p>
<p t="4853829" d="3170">Well, it might be a sign of respect.</p>
<p t="4856999" d="3822">Well there is one sign of respect that comes
out, and that is that every… I'd say once</p>
<p t="4860821" d="5548">a year or so … probably a dozen times since
the book has been published, I've been asked</p>
<p t="4866369" d="7321">by the editor of a postmodern or close fellow-traveler,
critical-theory-type of journal, to be a second</p>
<p t="4873690" d="6279">reviewer on one of their articles. So I'm
“in their Rolodex,” so to speak—to use</p>
<p t="4879969" d="5550">the old-fashioned label—when they are actually
looking for someone who is likely to give</p>
<p t="4885519" d="6120">an objective but critical perspective on some
article that's been submitted to the journal—once</p>
<p t="4891639" d="3721">in a while my name floats up and they'll
send it out to me, so I'll just do the standard</p>
<p t="4895360" d="4719">thing of reading it and giving my professional
opinion of it.</p>
<p t="4900079" d="4131">So I think they are aware of me, but there
hasn't really been any direct intellectual</p>
<p t="4904210" d="2550">engagement, which is kind of sad.</p>
<p t="4906760" d="7009">Right. Yes. So now when you set yourself up
to write the book, were you thinking of writing</p>
<p t="4913769" d="6341">a critique of postmodernism, or were you thinking
of conducting an exploration of postmodernism?</p>
<p t="4920110" d="6759">Well, right now I'm working on the critique.
The first book ends—I don't want to say</p>
<p t="4926869" d="7891">abruptly—but it does end with the door open
to saying: How then do we respond to this</p>
<p t="4934760" d="6160">dead end of Counter-Enlightenment thought
in postmodernism? So we're at a point culturally</p>
<p t="4940920" d="6230">where the meaning of postmodernism has now
infected the academy and you see problems</p>
<p t="4947150" d="3909">there, but it's also left the academy, and
so thoughtful people outside the academy are</p>
<p t="4951059" d="4940">seeing the results. And so the big question
is: What do we do next?</p>
<p t="4955999" d="5700">So I am actively working on the sequel to
Explaining Postmodernism now. And I did go</p>
<p t="4961699" d="6020">back and forth in the writing of it. My first
purpose was to write a straight diagnosis</p>
<p t="4967719" d="7270">and intellectual history of postmodernism,
and that's where I ended up leaving it,</p>
<p t="4974989" d="6911">because in one sense this was a bit artificial,
but I really like 200-page books. It's long</p>
<p t="4981900" d="5630">enough for you to get into a subject deeply
enough and to make a good, pointed, integrated</p>
<p t="4987530" d="2379">argument and then stop.</p>
<p t="4989909" d="6641">And so I realized if I wrote the sequel then,
it would be a 400-page book, and I thought</p>
<p t="4996550" d="4199">it was more important to get this self-contained
intellectual history of postmodernism out</p>
<p t="5000749" d="13680">there. So I brought things to I think a logical
conclusion where I ended the book, and now</p>
<p t="5014429" d="1581">I'm working on the next.</p>
<p t="5016010" d="1069">What's the next one called?</p>
<p t="5017079" d="4210">The working title … it changes every few
months or so—sometimes I think about, The</p>
<p t="5021289" d="6560">Fate of the Enlightenment or something to
do with Neo-Enlightenment or—it won't</p>
<p t="5027849" d="7190">be this—but Post-Postmodernism or After
Postmodernism—something like that.</p>
<p t="5035039" d="4020">Okay. We've been struggling with terminology
as well with the people I'm been talking</p>
<p t="5039059" d="1261">with about such things.</p>
<p t="5040320" d="7351">It's a very hard thing to do, because as
we've seen philosophically, Postmodernism</p>
<p t="5047671" d="4999">is multi-dimensional: it's a metaphysical
critique, it's a normative critique, it's</p>
<p t="5052670" d="5139">a political critique, it's an epistemological
set of views. And so the alternative then</p>
<p t="5057809" d="6710">also has to be integrated philosophically.
There has to be an entire philosophical package—so</p>
<p t="5064519" d="7581">what label is going to capture all of that
and at the same time make a connection to</p>
<p t="5072100" d="5990">postmodernism—and also, I'm basically
an optimistic positive guy, so I want something</p>
<p t="5078090" d="2429">that has a positive …</p>
<p t="5080519" d="2020">Yes, illuminates the pathway forward.</p>
<p t="5082539" d="4680">Yes, that's right, yes. Making the world
a better place</p>
<p t="5087219" d="6300">Right. Exactly, exactly. So look—I think
an hour-and-a-half interview is approximately</p>
<p t="5093519" d="1980">the equivalent of a 200-page book.</p>
<p t="5095499" d="1620">So we're done.</p>
<p t="5097119" d="7420">Why don't we end with that, and what I would
like to propose is that we have another discussion</p>
<p t="5104539" d="5620">in a couple of months about what you're
thinking about with regards to what you're</p>
<p t="5110159" d="1000">writing now.</p>
<p t="5111159" d="4241">So, like, we've covered the intellectual
territory; we've covered the historical</p>
<p t="5115400" d="6389">territory; and done a reasonably good job
I think of both “justifying” postmodernism</p>
<p t="5121789" d="3920">in this discussion, and also pointing out
its pitfalls and dangers.</p>
<p t="5125709" d="1030">Sure, yes.</p>
<p t="5126739" d="7771">We haven't outlined much for an alternative
vision except making tangential reference</p>
<p t="5134510" d="7569">to the potency of individual capacity, but
that would seem to be reasonable grounds for</p>
<p t="5142079" d="1231">the next discussion. So …</p>
<p t="5143310" d="5429">What else would be worth, next time we chat,
talking about are the current culture war</p>
<p t="5148739" d="4820">issues. You know, one of the things I'm
very interested in is younger people in particular</p>
<p t="5153559" d="5980">who are in the front lines in universities,
so to speak, and they're surrounded and</p>
<p t="5159539" d="6500">bewildered and angry, and in some cases, intimidated
by all of this “micro-aggressions” and</p>
<p t="5166039" d="2910">so forth, and in some cases the indoctrination
they're getting …</p>
<p t="5168949" d="4670">But I'm actually kind of glad that we didn't
talk about the more political end of it today,</p>
<p t="5173619" d="3670">because it enabled us to have a conversation
that was almost entirely philosophical in</p>
<p t="5177289" d="5770">nature, and I really think that's the right
level of analysis, because the battle that's</p>
<p t="5183059" d="4071">occurring in our culture is actually occurring
at a philosophical level. I mean, there's</p>
<p t="5187130" d="5000">other levels as well, but that's even more
important than the political level as far</p>
<p t="5192130" d="1000">as I'm concerned.</p>
<p t="5193130" d="3900">Well said. I agree one-hundred percent. Nicely
put.</p>
<p t="5197030" d="2319">All right. Well, it was a pleasure speaking
with you—it was very much worthwhile.</p>
<p t="5199349" d="1080">For me too, thanks much.</p>
<p t="5200429" d="4881">You have a remarkable capacity for tracking
the content of conversations and keeping them</p>
<p t="5205310" d="4669">on point, so that's quite amazing to see,
because we did branch out in a lot of different</p>
<p t="5209979" d="5941">directions, more or less simultaneously, and
it was quite helpful in keeping the conversation</p>
<p t="5215920" d="4950">on track that you could so rapidly organize
the … You know, it was almost like you were</p>
<p t="5220870" d="3269">putting a paragraph structure in the conversation
as it occurred, so that was something that</p>
<p t="5224139" d="1590">was really interesting to see.</p>
<p t="5225729" d="3881">So, anyways, it was a pleasure meeting you,
and thanks very much for talking with me.</p>
<p t="5229610" d="3259">I'll obviously put a link … I've been
recommending your book like …</p>
<p t="5232869" d="4540">My pleasure. Much respect for the work you're
doing. Thanks for having me on your show,</p>
<p t="5237409" d="2090">and will be happy to talk again.</p>
<p t="5239499" d="1591">Great. Good. We'll set that up.</p>
<p t="5241090" d="1299">All right. Thanks Jordan. Bye.</p>
<p t="5242389" d="1290">See you. Yep. Bye bye.</p>
