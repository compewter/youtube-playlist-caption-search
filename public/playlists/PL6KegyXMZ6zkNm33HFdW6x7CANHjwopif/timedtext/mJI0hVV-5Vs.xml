<p t="5690" d="6130">So I think this part of the course is always
a part I have difficulty with, because the</p>
<p t="11820" d="3299">conceptual transformation is very, very large.</p>
<p t="15119" d="7011">Because so far we've been talking about,
I would say, biological and evolutionary realities,</p>
<p t="22130" d="2910">in a sense.</p>
<p t="25040" d="2580">And we've been doing that in a relatively
standard manner.</p>
<p t="27620" d="5680">I mean, there are elements of Piagetian theory
that run through it, there are elements of</p>
<p t="33300" d="6099">cybernetic theory, there are elements of neurobiology
and neuropsychology.</p>
<p t="39399" d="9631">And none of it, I would say in some sense,
is radically outside the way these sorts of</p>
<p t="49030" d="16449">problems might be discussed in a typical scientific
or social scientific manner.</p>
<p t="65479" d="6671">Except for maybe the fact that we've drawn
an explicit distinction between the world</p>
<p t="72150" d="6900">as a place of things and the world as a place
of action.</p>
<p t="79050" d="4410">Now there are consequences to the idea that
the world is a place of action that start</p>
<p t="83460" d="3750">to become more radical at this point.</p>
<p t="87210" d="5590">But drawing the relationship between what
I've already talked to you about and the</p>
<p t="92800" d="9230">narrative domains that we're going to explore
now, requires a… like a radical shift in</p>
<p t="102030" d="2070">conceptual focus.</p>
<p t="104100" d="5060">And so, the way I'm going to handle that
is by hitting it from ten or eleven different</p>
<p t="109160" d="6860">directions, and building up a pattern.</p>
<p t="116020" d="3400">You know, if you listen to a complex piece
of music, or at least this is my experience</p>
<p t="119420" d="4350">with complex music, is sometimes, the first
time I hear it, I don't really like it,</p>
<p t="123770" d="2639">and I think I also don't understand it.</p>
<p t="126409" d="1841">I actually can't hear it.</p>
<p t="128250" d="2830">You know, maybe a musical genius could hear
the whole thing instantly.</p>
<p t="131080" d="7330">You know, they say Franz Liszt could sight-read
anything on the piano first try.</p>
<p t="138410" d="5270">So, you know, some people are so intelligent
musically that it's incomprehensible, and</p>
<p t="143680" d="2400">I'm sure they hear things just fine the
first time they hear them.</p>
<p t="146080" d="4810">But then what happens for me is that if I
listen to it a couple more times or pieces</p>
<p t="150890" d="3820">or chunks of it, they start to fall into place
that I can follow, and, you know, I can see</p>
<p t="154710" d="2109">the beauty sort of shine through those.</p>
<p t="156819" d="5232">And then eventually, the whole thing links
together, and then I can listen to it, especially</p>
<p t="162051" d="4369">if it's a complex piece of music, many,
many, many times.</p>
<p t="166420" d="3870">And the more complex, and probably the better,
the piece of music, the more I can listen</p>
<p t="170290" d="1000">to it.</p>
<p t="171290" d="4810">But if I listen to it enough, at some point
then I've had enough of it, and it's all</p>
<p t="176100" d="2500">a very strange phenomenon.</p>
<p t="178600" d="3230">Because one of the things you might ask yourself
is, what exactly are you learning while you're</p>
<p t="181830" d="1000">doing that?</p>
<p t="182830" d="7190">You know, it seems like you want the music
to be just exactly the right amount of predictable</p>
<p t="190020" d="1000">and unpredictable.</p>
<p t="191020" d="3299">If it's too unpredictable then you can't
understand it and if it's too predictable</p>
<p t="194319" d="2411">it's boring, and so it's just like a conversation
that way.</p>
<p t="196730" d="2450">It's actually just like life as well!</p>
<p t="199180" d="4980">You know, because you want things to be predictable
and stable, and you want things to be unpredictable</p>
<p t="204160" d="5810">and interesting, and the degree to which you
want each of those is going to depend on the</p>
<p t="209970" d="5820">time and the context and also on your own
intelligence and temperament.</p>
<p t="215790" d="8530">Now, I'm going to tell you a bunch of stories
and give you a number of pieces of information,</p>
<p t="224320" d="3150">and hopefully they'll click together.</p>
<p t="227470" d="4560">Now I think the reason this information has
always been transmitted in story and image</p>
<p t="232030" d="5459">form is because it's very, very difficult
to transform it into articulated, like into</p>
<p t="237489" d="1360">fully articulated explanation.</p>
<p t="238849" d="1691">It isn't really how it works.</p>
<p t="240540" d="4020">You know, we're not really accustomed to
thinking about the idea that there are certain</p>
<p t="244560" d="6120">forms of information (that are valid forms
of information) that can't be transmitted</p>
<p t="250680" d="1000">verbally.</p>
<p t="251680" d="2320">But of course, if you think about it, we all
understand this deeply.</p>
<p t="254000" d="3049">Well, I can give you a bunch of examples.</p>
<p t="257049" d="5991">The first example is that when you speak,
not only do you speak in words and phrases</p>
<p t="263040" d="4260">and sentences and paragraphs, but you also
speak melodically.</p>
<p t="267300" d="4270">And in fact, part of the reason that you can
understand melodies and that they make sense</p>
<p t="271570" d="7569">to you is that what artists have done is separated
the melodic elements of speech from the semantic</p>
<p t="279139" d="2591">element, and then played with the melodic
element.</p>
<p t="281730" d="4300">And the melodic element tends to carry a lot
of emotion and intent.</p>
<p t="286030" d="5780">And so, if you're listening to someone speak,
you can tell when they're being ironic,</p>
<p t="291810" d="3510">you know, because they raise an eyebrow, and
their voice changes slightly, even though</p>
<p t="295320" d="3190">they might be using, in fact they are using,
exactly the same words.</p>
<p t="298510" d="5120">And in fact someone who's very good at being
witty or ironic will set the situation up</p>
<p t="303630" d="5050">so that you can barely tell that they're
joking, and the better they are at that, the</p>
<p t="308680" d="4470">tinier the hint they give you that you can
still catch on to, the funnier the situation</p>
<p t="313150" d="2070">is.</p>
<p t="315220" d="3920">So we know that information can be transmitted
through non-verbal channels.</p>
<p t="319140" d="2990">It even happens during speech.</p>
<p t="322130" d="8680">And then, of course, we understand that music
presents to us an intimation of meaning that's</p>
<p t="330810" d="2520">very difficult to fully grasp.</p>
<p t="333330" d="7200">And music for me has always been an ineffable
phenomenon in some sense because it carries</p>
<p t="340530" d="5160">the intimation of meaning in a manner that
can't be rationally dismissed, or that people</p>
<p t="345690" d="3220">aren't interested in rationally dismissing.</p>
<p t="348910" d="6710">Even punk rock nihilists listen to punk rock
nihilistic music, and they find that meaningful</p>
<p t="355620" d="2190">even though they don't believe in meaning!</p>
<p t="357810" d="4359">And you know, in some sense they're victims
of their own rationality, because they do</p>
<p t="362169" d="2571">believe in meaning (or else they wouldn't
be listening to the music), but they can't</p>
<p t="364740" d="4989">understand how they could possibly believe
in it, so their rational mind has dispensed</p>
<p t="369729" d="1000">with the idea.</p>
<p t="370729" d="4381">And sometimes people dispense with the idea
of meaning, for lots of reasons.</p>
<p t="375110" d="4910">Partly because it's inevitable, in some
sense, with sufficient rationality, but also</p>
<p t="380020" d="6660">because it's always useful to look for the
underbelly of things, because it also justifies</p>
<p t="386680" d="3150">not bearing any responsibility for your life.</p>
<p t="389830" d="6780">And that's fairly… that can be a very
desirable side-effect of the particular ideological</p>
<p t="396610" d="1220">rational belief.</p>
<p t="397830" d="5150">And then there's dance, of course, and dance
is even more ineffable than music, although</p>
<p t="402980" d="4830">it's often paired with music, you know,
and it grips people.</p>
<p t="407810" d="5290">If you see a remarkable dance performance,
well part of it is that you're sort of thrilled</p>
<p t="413100" d="3730">and excited about seeing just exactly what
the human form can do.</p>
<p t="416830" d="6900">Perhaps, partly, because you're human and
when you see someone extending a certain ability</p>
<p t="423730" d="5939">far beyond the norm then it expands your sense
of what a human being is capable of, so there's</p>
<p t="429669" d="2081">that, there's the pure skill element.</p>
<p t="431750" d="5650">And then there's the novelty element, because
often if you watch a particularly good dancer</p>
<p t="437400" d="3120">there's things they do that you haven't
seen before that you didn't know anyone</p>
<p t="440520" d="1930">could do and that's pretty fun.</p>
<p t="442450" d="5469">And then often the dance is joined with the
music and the body is expressing what the</p>
<p t="447919" d="3841">music means and even though you can't tell
what the music means you can tell that the</p>
<p t="451760" d="1770">dance is expressing it.</p>
<p t="453530" d="5850">See I think what happens there is that music
represents the patterns of being.</p>
<p t="459380" d="3759">It's actually because people think of music
as a non-representational art, but I think</p>
<p t="463139" d="3931">that's wrong, I think it might be the most
representational art.</p>
<p t="467070" d="7580">Being is made up of layers of patterns constantly
interacting, and hopefully in a relatively</p>
<p t="474650" d="6980">harmonious way, and music demonstrates that,
mimics it in some sense, abstractly.</p>
<p t="481630" d="3120">And then the dance is an abstract representation.</p>
<p t="484750" d="4280">People adapt to the patterns of being and
the dancer adapts to the pattern of music,</p>
<p t="489030" d="7380">and so it's symbolic, it's an embodied
display of the place of the person in the</p>
<p t="496410" d="1000">cosmos.</p>
<p t="497410" d="3970">And you could also make that case when you
see people dancing in pairs, because you could</p>
<p t="501380" d="7580">dance alone or you could dance in pairs, and
that's basically standard human adaptation.</p>
<p t="508960" d="3910">And music is interesting too because one of
the things you'll notice is that there's</p>
<p t="512870" d="2539">always music in a movie.</p>
<p t="515409" d="1000">Almost always.</p>
<p t="516409" d="3310">There's the odd movie that doesn't have
it but it's quite marked when it's absent,</p>
<p t="519719" d="1000">you know.</p>
<p t="520719" d="3491">The movie feels a lot more cold and clinical,
although it can work.</p>
<p t="524210" d="5150">But we accept the idea that music can be used
to fill in the missing context in a movie</p>
<p t="529360" d="2040">without even ever questioning it, right?</p>
<p t="531400" d="5620">Like, it's very strange if you think about
it, that you go to a movie that is doing…</p>
<p t="537020" d="5160">at least part of its function is to portray
reality in a realistic way, but there's</p>
<p t="542180" d="2080">a soundtrack playing in the background all
the time.</p>
<p t="544260" d="6940">You know it's so useful and so appropriate
that you don't notice how strange it is</p>
<p t="551200" d="2530">that that's okay.</p>
<p t="553730" d="6780">So, my point is that we well, and then of
course you can talk about novels and plays</p>
<p t="560510" d="5910">the same way, because there's a lot more
to a novel than the words themselves.</p>
<p t="566420" d="8190">There's you know, a novel is a deeply layered
thing, and part of your understanding of the</p>
<p t="574610" d="4000">novel is your understanding of the interrelationships
between the layers, especially if it's a</p>
<p t="578610" d="1289">profound novel.</p>
<p t="579899" d="5991">I mean I think that's why we have this sense
of depth in artistic and literary works.</p>
<p t="585890" d="5940">If the work is deep then it has many, many
layers, and the more layers it has interacting</p>
<p t="591830" d="5140">at the same time, the more it's a useful
representation of the essential elements of</p>
<p t="596970" d="2770">being, and so the more meaningful it is to
us.</p>
<p t="599740" d="7240">So, that's all to say that there are modes
of communication that provide us with information</p>
<p t="606980" d="6500">that we can't articulate but that we still
act as if that information is valid.</p>
<p t="613480" d="5460">And you might say, well, valid for what, what
exactly is it doing, what is it representing,</p>
<p t="618940" d="4230">what kind of information is it offering that's
so compelling?</p>
<p t="623170" d="3550">And what's so interesting about it is the
kind of information that we're talking,</p>
<p t="626720" d="6040">that information is so compelling, that you'll
pay to expose yourself to it.</p>
<p t="632760" d="3980">You know, it's a rare lecture that you go
to and have to pay for the lecture itself.</p>
<p t="636740" d="3800">I mean, you'll come to the university and
you'll get your degree, but if you had your</p>
<p t="640540" d="5530">option on a Saturday afternoon, or a Saturday
night, let's say, it's relatively unlikely</p>
<p t="646070" d="3220">that you would attend a lecture, and certainly
even more than unlikely that you would pay</p>
<p t="649290" d="4810">to attend one, but you'll certainly pay
to go somewhere to dance to music.</p>
<p t="654100" d="3650">And, you know, why that is, is not obvious.</p>
<p t="657750" d="1459">You say, well it's entertaining.</p>
<p t="659209" d="4310">It's like, yeah it's entertaining alright
but it's a lot more than that, and I think</p>
<p t="663519" d="4422">that dismissing things that are enjoyable
as entertainment, which means that they're</p>
<p t="667941" d="6749">sort of peripheral, they're unimportant
in some sense is a real, it's a real terrible</p>
<p t="674690" d="1620">habit of psychologists.</p>
<p t="676310" d="6899">So for example, when Steven Pinker wrote his
book… it's a book on language and unfortunately</p>
<p t="683209" d="4901">I can't remember its name at the moment…
he devoted one chapter at the end basically,</p>
<p t="688110" d="5849">to non-verbal cultural forms and he talked
about them as epiphenomenal, fundamentally.</p>
<p t="693959" d="4121">You know, they're just a by-product.</p>
<p t="698080" d="6160">And I think that's deeply wrong, I think
that our culture actually grew out of dance</p>
<p t="704240" d="10230">and drama and music, and science came way,
way later than that.</p>
<p t="714470" d="2270">I was watching an old video today.</p>
<p t="716740" d="6279">It was of The Animals playing House of the
Rising Sun in 1964.</p>
<p t="723019" d="2341">It's a pretty good video, and it's a great
old song.</p>
<p t="725360" d="4360">I mean, they didn't write it, it's an
old blues song, but it's a great old song</p>
<p t="729720" d="2200">and they do a pretty good job of it.</p>
<p t="731920" d="4099">And the audience was full of girls and they
were screaming madly away.</p>
<p t="736019" d="4260">Now it wasn't quite as bad as The Beatles,
which was completely unbelievable, but it</p>
<p t="740279" d="5641">was still, you know, a fairly continual din
of delighted shrieks.</p>
<p t="745920" d="4609">And, you know, I think that's extremely
interesting because you'd never see that</p>
<p t="750529" d="2151">at a scientific conference [students' laughter].</p>
<p t="752680" d="1830">Well, it's strange, eh?</p>
<p t="754510" d="6100">Like, there isn't anything else that elicits
that kind of response.</p>
<p t="760610" d="7570">Maybe sports to some minimal degree, but certainly
with nowhere near the same amount of enthusiasm.</p>
<p t="768180" d="3520">And you know, I mean, that's been happening
for a long time, it wasn't merely a phenomenon</p>
<p t="771700" d="1090">of the 60s.</p>
<p t="772790" d="4299">I mean, I suspect it's been happening ever
since there's been wandering minstrels,</p>
<p t="777089" d="1861">and that's a very, very long time.</p>
<p t="778950" d="5540">And I suspect that those wandering minstrels
left many offspring behind them [laughter].</p>
<p t="784490" d="4589">And well, what's interesting about that
is, obviously part of the reason that human</p>
<p t="789079" d="3211">beings can sing is because we've selected
each other for that ability, right?</p>
<p t="792290" d="5049">I mean there's something very attractive
about someone who's artistically gifted.</p>
<p t="797339" d="9961">And the idea that women will do backflips
for a singer is not necessarily any negative</p>
<p t="807300" d="7550">comment on their ability to evaluate what's
important, it might be quite the reverse.</p>
<p t="814850" d="3299">So anyways, the point is that there's lots
of different ways that we can communicate</p>
<p t="818149" d="1000">information.</p>
<p t="819149" d="3531">And you might say well it's only simple
information that can be conveyed that way,</p>
<p t="822680" d="5890">and you have to convey the complex information
in more formal forms, scientific and philosophical,</p>
<p t="828570" d="2400">but I think that's exactly backwards.</p>
<p t="830970" d="5650">I think we get to articulate the simple stuff
first, which is only what you expect, right?</p>
<p t="836620" d="5500">Because when you're mastering something
difficult, like the unfolding of being, the</p>
<p t="842120" d="3860">probability that you're going to get to
the simple things first and the complicated</p>
<p t="845980" d="1890">things later is pretty much 100%.</p>
<p t="847870" d="7620">And I mean, different fields advance at different
speeds, but the artists and musicians get</p>
<p t="855490" d="5770">to the complex matters far before the scientists
and the engineers.</p>
<p t="861260" d="1410">And it has to be that way.</p>
<p t="862670" d="7380">One of the deep things I learned from Jung
was that, as our knowledge expands out into</p>
<p t="870050" d="5110">the unknown, there are people operating at
the periphery, and so they really have one</p>
<p t="875160" d="3390">foot in the unknown and one foot on dry land,
so to speak.</p>
<p t="878550" d="2530">And some of them are more in the water than
the others.</p>
<p t="881080" d="4520">And the ones almost submerged up to their
neck, when they tell you what they're seeing,</p>
<p t="885600" d="5489">it has to be poetic and musical and artistic,
because it's so far beyond our capacity</p>
<p t="891089" d="3581">to articulate, that we can't represent it
in words.</p>
<p t="894670" d="5510">And so all that can happen is that the artist
can get hold of it, and maybe the people who</p>
<p t="900180" d="5959">are prone to religious-like sentiments, at
least experiences, which seems to be associated</p>
<p t="906139" d="1631">by the way with the trait openness.</p>
<p t="907770" d="4730">To have the actual religious experience, rather
than to be an adherent of the dogma, which</p>
<p t="912500" d="2370">is associated with low openness.</p>
<p t="914870" d="6790">So for Jung, it was the artists and the entrepreneurs,
because they're the same people, who were</p>
<p t="921660" d="3800">at the forefront of the expansion of what
we know into what is unknown.</p>
<p t="925460" d="5160">And I think you can see echoes of that in
the way in which cities are rejuvenated.</p>
<p t="930620" d="3769">Because what happens, you can certainly see
this in Toronto, is that a part of the city</p>
<p t="934389" d="6211">that has some architectural or contextual
interest but is badly run down, starts to</p>
<p t="940600" d="4910">get… at some point, you know, the artistic
people show up and they think “Hey!</p>
<p t="945510" d="1310">This is kind of cool.</p>
<p t="946820" d="3060">If we just did this to it there'd really
be something to it”.</p>
<p t="949880" d="4459">And it usually doesn't hurt that the rents
are low because of course artists never have</p>
<p t="954339" d="1321">any money.</p>
<p t="955660" d="2549">So then they go in there and civilise the
hell out of it.</p>
<p t="958209" d="3661">And of course, they're renting, and that
jacks up the property value, and then the</p>
<p t="961870" d="4120">people who are a little less open but kind
of interested in art start flowing in behind</p>
<p t="965990" d="1000">them.</p>
<p t="966990" d="4620">And then soon the whole place is rejuvenated
and expensive, and of course the artists have</p>
<p t="971610" d="1520">to go somewhere else.</p>
<p t="973130" d="4160">But that's a very interesting phenomenon,
because what's happening is that even in</p>
<p t="977290" d="7560">the cities they're taking chaos and turning
it into order, and that's what artists do.</p>
<p t="984850" d="6860">Now that's all to tell you that there are
different ways of transmitting and representing</p>
<p t="991710" d="6869">information, and that you can incorporate
the information without any articulated notion</p>
<p t="998579" d="1760">of what you're doing.</p>
<p t="1000339" d="4120">So of course that's the case, because otherwise
you'd have to claim that you understand</p>
<p t="1004459" d="6810">everything that you do and can articulate
it, and that's just wrong, you know.</p>
<p t="1011269" d="3751">You have a theory of yourself but it's not
a very accurate theory, which is why you're</p>
<p t="1015020" d="4090">always doing things that are strange as far
as you're concerned, which is also extremely</p>
<p t="1019110" d="1000">bizarre.</p>
<p t="1020110" d="5120">It's like, who the hell are you if you can't
even control your own behaviour?</p>
<p t="1025230" d="3250">And what does it mean to control it, and what
does it mean to not control it?</p>
<p t="1028480" d="4120">These are very, very complex and strange issues.</p>
<p t="1032600" d="8049">Alright, so I think the best way into this
is actually from an evolutionary perspective.</p>
<p t="1040649" d="6861">And I'm not convinced that this is correct
but I think there's something to it.</p>
<p t="1047510" d="10730">So when you think about the nature of experience,
then you think, well the nature of experience</p>
<p t="1058240" d="4049">is quite different for different sorts of
creatures.</p>
<p t="1062289" d="3490">And one of the primary differences between
creatures is the degree to which they're</p>
<p t="1065779" d="4551">capable of social interaction and then of
complex social interaction.</p>
<p t="1070330" d="4439">And primates generally speaking are very social
creatures.</p>
<p t="1074769" d="5270">They live in troops, or packs, like dogs.</p>
<p t="1080039" d="3070">Which is why we can get along with dogs, because
we understand each other.</p>
<p t="1083109" d="4341">Being hierarchical troop animals, we understand
dogs, and they understand us, and they can</p>
<p t="1087450" d="2740">fit right in, pretty much.</p>
<p t="1090190" d="6300">And we're very, very good at figuring out
where we are in the troop.</p>
<p t="1096490" d="2909">And by ‘we' I mean primates.</p>
<p t="1099399" d="2740">I mean that's going back a very, very long
period of time.</p>
<p t="1102139" d="5150">You know, monkeys and chimpanzees have very
sophisticated knowledge of the social structures</p>
<p t="1107289" d="1191">surrounding them.</p>
<p t="1108480" d="3610">They know who's who, and they know what
status they are, they know what rank they</p>
<p t="1112090" d="2000">are, essentially.</p>
<p t="1114090" d="3000">And that's also the case with people.</p>
<p t="1117090" d="5839">And so one of the things you might say about
people is that our reality isn't nature,</p>
<p t="1122929" d="1000">exactly.</p>
<p t="1123929" d="1850">It's culture.</p>
<p t="1125779" d="5181">Now, you can make the argument that you can't
really distinguish nature from culture, and</p>
<p t="1130960" d="5319">I believe that that's true and untrue, in
a sense.</p>
<p t="1136279" d="5311">I think you can talk about the human and non-human
elements of reality.</p>
<p t="1141590" d="4939">And you can identify the human elements of
reality as culture, even though culture is</p>
<p t="1146529" d="5460">so old that you can also think about it as
an inevitable part of nature.</p>
<p t="1151989" d="7241">So anyway, so most of our experience in our
evolutionary past, at least let's say for</p>
<p t="1159230" d="5759">the last several million years, we might as
well go back to when the ancestors of humans</p>
<p t="1164989" d="6451">hypothetically split off from the ancestors
of chimpanzees.</p>
<p t="1171440" d="4770">And people know very accurately when these
sorts of splits occur, by the way, because</p>
<p t="1176210" d="4179">what they do is they have some sense of the
rate of transformation of DNA.</p>
<p t="1180389" d="4411">You know it transforms and the rate is fairly
constant across time.</p>
<p t="1184800" d="5830">And so if you take two creatures and you determine
how much genetic similarity there is between</p>
<p t="1190630" d="5590">them, and how much difference, you could calculate
how far back they diverged.</p>
<p t="1196220" d="3699">And so, the fossil record helps with that,
although it's very sparse.</p>
<p t="1199919" d="4970">But the DNA record is not very sparse at all,
in some sense, so you can be very accurate</p>
<p t="1204889" d="1000">about it.</p>
<p t="1205889" d="5460">We can even tell when people evolved or learned
to wear clothing, and the reason we can tell</p>
<p t="1211349" d="4630">that is because there's certain kinds of
lice that can only live on clothing, and they</p>
<p t="1215979" d="4700">seem to have diverged from the lice that live
in hair about 50,000 years ago, something</p>
<p t="1220679" d="1090">like that.</p>
<p t="1221769" d="3431">And so the hypothesis is that, well, we must
have been figuring out how to wear clothes</p>
<p t="1225200" d="2669">at that point because the lice figured out
how to live in them.</p>
<p t="1227869" d="3831">So, you know, it probably took them a little
while, but I doubt if it took them very long.</p>
<p t="1231700" d="5219">You know those little creatures that breed
fast, man those things can evolve quickly,</p>
<p t="1236919" d="1980">much to our dismay.</p>
<p t="1238899" d="7510">So okay, so a big part of the experiential
field of advanced primates is the social world.</p>
<p t="1246409" d="2010">And so we could call that the primate world.</p>
<p t="1248419" d="4720">And we could also say that another big part
of their experience is the non-primate world,</p>
<p t="1253139" d="3201">which would be, roughly speaking, the natural
world.</p>
<p t="1256340" d="5949">And then we could also say that the other
elements of their experience that are very</p>
<p t="1262289" d="4720">constant are their subjective being.</p>
<p t="1267009" d="6230">And we don't know much about the subjective
being of creatures like chimpanzees, although</p>
<p t="1273239" d="4991">you can understand, I think, the subjective
being of a dog well enough to befriend the</p>
<p t="1278230" d="1029">dog.</p>
<p t="1279259" d="2170">And so you have some insight.</p>
<p t="1281429" d="3781">And I think it's also reasonable to assume
that…</p>
<p t="1285210" d="4099">I mean for a long time people were unwilling
to admit that animals had a soul, that was</p>
<p t="1289309" d="1000">the first problem.</p>
<p t="1290309" d="2480">But after that, that they were conscious.</p>
<p t="1292789" d="1990">And even the behaviourists fought that notion.</p>
<p t="1294779" d="5230">But I think the simplest thing to do is to
assume that animals and human beings are the</p>
<p t="1300009" d="2461">same, except when you can prove that they're
different.</p>
<p t="1302470" d="4379">Because we share so much of our evolutionary
past then the logical inference is that if</p>
<p t="1306849" d="4320">you think a dog is doing something sort of
like you would do in that situation, and feeling</p>
<p t="1311169" d="4411">that way, it probably is, with certain exceptions
for species difference.</p>
<p t="1315580" d="3909">And if that wasn't the case I don't think
that you could have a relationship with the</p>
<p t="1319489" d="1591">dog, or cat.</p>
<p t="1321080" d="5510">You can't have much of a relationship with
a lizard, although there are lizards, bearded</p>
<p t="1326590" d="1819">dragons in particular, that are social.</p>
<p t="1328409" d="2840">They like to lay on top of each other and
they hang around together.</p>
<p t="1331249" d="2660">And you can actually have more of a relationship
with them.</p>
<p t="1333909" d="2531">And apparently the same is true for iguanas.</p>
<p t="1336440" d="8390">So you can go quite a ways backwards in evolutionary
time, and still have enough similarity between</p>
<p t="1344830" d="3750">you and the creature that you're interacting
with, so you can get a pretty good sense of</p>
<p t="1348580" d="2969">at least some element of their being.</p>
<p t="1351549" d="7031">And so, the idea that subjective, or subjectivity,
is a very ancient part of our experience,</p>
<p t="1358580" d="2839">seems to me to be a perfectly reasonable supposition.</p>
<p t="1361419" d="4771">We certainly know that it's been around,
in all likelihood, for at least 150,000 years</p>
<p t="1366190" d="5030">(on the conservative side), because there
have been human beings that are essentially</p>
<p t="1371220" d="5480">identical to us, from a genetic perspective,
going back 150,000 years.</p>
<p t="1376700" d="5120">But I think you'd have to be a pretty harsh
judge to assume that higher-order primates</p>
<p t="1381820" d="3079">like chimps don't have some consciousness.</p>
<p t="1384899" d="5061">And you know, and some limited self-consciousness.</p>
<p t="1389960" d="5299">You know, if you mark a chimp's nose with
lipstick and then show it a mirror, it will,</p>
<p t="1395259" d="2941">at least sometimes, take the lipstick off
its nose.</p>
<p t="1398200" d="3689">Although I've seen a gorilla try to fight
with a mirror.</p>
<p t="1401889" d="4831">Well no, I haven't personally seen that,
but I've seen a very good video of that</p>
<p t="1406720" d="1000">happening.</p>
<p t="1407720" d="6169">But I think the gorilla in it would eventually
figure out that it was him in the mirror.</p>
<p t="1413889" d="5431">Dogs will recognise a dog in the mirror, but
they seem to ignore their reflection very,</p>
<p t="1419320" d="1000">very rapidly.</p>
<p t="1420320" d="3739">And I don't know if that means that they
have a very rudimentary self-consciousness,</p>
<p t="1424059" d="5230">and that they figure out that that dog is
them, or if the dog just doesn't smell like</p>
<p t="1429289" d="3940">a dog, and then the dog thinks “well it
can't be a dog because it doesn't smell</p>
<p t="1433229" d="1000">like a dog”.</p>
<p t="1434229" d="3990">And dogs probably think that something is
a dog because of how it smells, and not because</p>
<p t="1438219" d="2911">of how it looks.</p>
<p t="1441130" d="4269">I think that's why dogs don't seem to
have any sense of relative size.</p>
<p t="1445399" d="6160">Because you can get a little Chihuahua barking
like mad at a Great Dane and you think, really?</p>
<p t="1451559" d="1761">That's going to work, is it?</p>
<p t="1453320" d="4219">But the dog doesn't seem to have a clue
about that, like he's perfectly happy.</p>
<p t="1457539" d="4451">And the Great Dane, weirdly enough, will often
back off.</p>
<p t="1461990" d="9059">Anyway, okay, so we've been in a social
world, a deeply social world for a long time,</p>
<p t="1471049" d="3960">and I'm also going to make the presupposition
that we've been in the stratified social</p>
<p t="1475009" d="1770">world for a very long period of time.</p>
<p t="1476779" d="4870">And I think you could call that, if you wanted
to, and I would never want to, by the way,</p>
<p t="1481649" d="3460">you could call that the patriarchy.</p>
<p t="1485109" d="5160">I think that I wouldn't call it that because
that's not what it is.</p>
<p t="1490269" d="8080">But I think that the fact that it's called
that, and that that's accepted as a reasonable</p>
<p t="1498349" d="4290">representation is actually a consequence of
the action of an archetype.</p>
<p t="1502639" d="5580">And the archetype is that, it's the archetype
of the terrible Great Father, actually.</p>
<p t="1508219" d="3910">Because you think, well there's a social
structure with striations in it, and that</p>
<p t="1512129" d="1370">has advantages and disadvantages.</p>
<p t="1513499" d="2850">And the advantages are that you can live in
it.</p>
<p t="1516349" d="3710">And the disadvantages are that you have to
follow the damn rules, and they might not</p>
<p t="1520059" d="2580">necessarily be to your individual benefit.</p>
<p t="1522639" d="8020">So, within a social dominance hierarchy, there's
always a bifurcated, it also always has bifurcated</p>
<p t="1530659" d="1000">significance.</p>
<p t="1531659" d="6701">It can be good, and is good, insofar as it
protects you from, say, from threat from without,</p>
<p t="1538360" d="3749">maybe from other primates invading your territory,
for example.</p>
<p t="1542109" d="7081">But it can also be a very dismal structure
if you happen to be at the bottom of the hierarchy.</p>
<p t="1549190" d="9849">So anyways, as far as I can tell, that dominance
structure is typically represented as masculine.</p>
<p t="1559039" d="5720">And I think the reason for that, although
I'm not absolutely certain of this, I think</p>
<p t="1564759" d="4470">the reason for that is that our social hierarchies
are probably more like chimp social hierarchies</p>
<p t="1569229" d="2160">than they are like bonobo social hierarchies.</p>
<p t="1571389" d="3010">So, the bonobos are kind of a strange breed
of chimps.</p>
<p t="1574399" d="1970">I don't know how many of you know about
them.</p>
<p t="1576369" d="7780">But the bonobos are extraordinarily sexual
and they use sex, pretty much as a standard</p>
<p t="1584149" d="2860">means of communication and tension reduction.</p>
<p t="1587009" d="7311">And there's a lot of sex between the females
and the bonobo troops, and the use of sex</p>
<p t="1594320" d="3850">seems to bond them together in a way that
keeps male aggression under control, which</p>
<p t="1598170" d="1509">is quite interesting.</p>
<p t="1599679" d="6201">But in the chimps the fundamental dominance
hierarchy is male, although there's a female</p>
<p t="1605880" d="5120">dominance hierarchy as well, and some females
can certainly be more dominant than some males.</p>
<p t="1611000" d="2710">But the fundamental structure seems to be
male.</p>
<p t="1613710" d="6439">And then I would also say, well, it's probably
dependent to some degree in the primate community,</p>
<p t="1620149" d="3140">and in other social animals, on other factors.</p>
<p t="1623289" d="7041">So we know, for example, that the gender that
has the highest level of testosterone tends</p>
<p t="1630330" d="1829">to be the dominant gender.</p>
<p t="1632159" d="4100">And so in hyenas the females actually have
a higher level of testosterone.</p>
<p t="1636259" d="3220">They're actually bigger and more aggressive
than the males, and the price they pay for</p>
<p t="1639479" d="4221">that is that they have to give birth through
a structure that's very much like a penis,</p>
<p t="1643700" d="5839">which is not the world's most pleasant experience,
and might account for the hyenas' temper.</p>
<p t="1649539" d="4701">But, in human beings, you know, you see sexual
dimorphism.</p>
<p t="1654240" d="6009">Men are slightly bigger than women, and that's
also generally characteristic of creatures</p>
<p t="1660249" d="4270">that have a dominance hierarchy that's tilted
towards masculine.</p>
<p t="1664519" d="8000">And then the other factor seems to be that
human beings have… our infants have very,</p>
<p t="1672519" d="7760">very, very, very long periods of dependence,
and it's very difficult to manoeuver your</p>
<p t="1680279" d="6690">way, doing anything, really, especially anything
that has to do with competition and power,</p>
<p t="1686969" d="5820">if you're taking care of one infant, let
alone three.</p>
<p t="1692789" d="9490">And so, it seems to me that those are all
valid reasons why the primary power structures</p>
<p t="1702279" d="5240">among human beings have typically been male,
and why they're represented as masculine.</p>
<p t="1707519" d="4000">Now there are other reasons too, because this
is a multi-faceted phenomenon.</p>
<p t="1711519" d="6020">I mean, one of the things that's interesting
about human females is that they're selective</p>
<p t="1717539" d="1450">maters.</p>
<p t="1718989" d="4410">Now chimp females are not selective maters,
and what that means is that the dominant males</p>
<p t="1723399" d="3561">still have most of the offspring, but the
reason for that, apparently, is because they</p>
<p t="1726960" d="4890">chase the subordinate males away from sexually
receptive females.</p>
<p t="1731850" d="4120">Although the sexually receptive females will
sneak off behind the rocks somewhere and mate</p>
<p t="1735970" d="2839">with the subordinate male.</p>
<p t="1738809" d="4740">But as long as the dominant male is around
the probability of that is quite low.</p>
<p t="1743549" d="5210">So the female chimps aren't sexually selective,
whereas human females have concealed ovulation,</p>
<p t="1748759" d="5181">so that no one knows when they're at their
most fertile, and they're selective maters.</p>
<p t="1753940" d="4299">And women in every society virtually, that's
ever been studies, have a typical pattern</p>
<p t="1758239" d="4481">of behaviour, which is that if you look at
the female dominance hierarchy and you look</p>
<p t="1762720" d="5199">at the male dominance hierarchy, the females
will mate across and up dominance hierarchies,</p>
<p t="1767919" d="2421">and the males will mate across and down.</p>
<p t="1770340" d="4949">Which works fine for both genders, because
their interests align.</p>
<p t="1775289" d="7130">But it also means that in all likelihood women
have exerted tremendous sexual selection pressure</p>
<p t="1782419" d="5130">on men, and that might be part of the reason,
of the many reasons, that we actually… you</p>
<p t="1787549" d="4151">know the theory is that the common ancestor
between chimps and humans was probably a lot</p>
<p t="1791700" d="3380">more like a chimp, a modern chimp, than like
a modern human.</p>
<p t="1795080" d="4630">So for whatever reason, we've undergone
a lot more transformation in the last 7 million</p>
<p t="1799710" d="1650">years than chimps have.</p>
<p t="1801360" d="5199">And one possible reason for that, and I think
it's a highly probable reason, is that sexual</p>
<p t="1806559" d="4541">selection operated a lot more viciously, so
to speak, among humans.</p>
<p t="1811100" d="5850">It's operated to the point where you have
twice as many female ancestors as male.</p>
<p t="1816950" d="3809">And you might think, well that can't be
possible, but here's how it's possible.</p>
<p t="1820759" d="5760">It's like, only every second man has children,
had a child, while all women had one.</p>
<p t="1826519" d="3520">Now of course, that isn't what happened,
but on average that's what happened.</p>
<p t="1830039" d="6531">So the proportion of men who are completely
childless in any given generation is far higher</p>
<p t="1836570" d="2469">than the proportion of women who are.</p>
<p t="1839039" d="6421">So you see an element of expendability in
males, and that's typical across the biological</p>
<p t="1845460" d="3380">community, because you don't need as many
males as you need females in order to keep</p>
<p t="1848840" d="3240">the population moving forward.</p>
<p t="1852080" d="3870">And one of the things that happens as a consequence
of that, at least in principle, is that males</p>
<p t="1855950" d="5630">are more behaviourally variable and variable
across a lot of dimensions, than females are.</p>
<p t="1861580" d="4319">And that's a plus, because they're more
variable on the upside, but it's also negative</p>
<p t="1865899" d="3211">because they're more prevalent on the downside.</p>
<p t="1869110" d="4629">Now there's some substantial argument about
that in relationship to people, what the actual</p>
<p t="1873739" d="4280">implications of that are for human beings.</p>
<p t="1878019" d="6720">One potential implication is that although
women and men have equivalent IQs, the standard</p>
<p t="1884739" d="1510">deviation is slightly different.</p>
<p t="1886249" d="4410">Which means that there are more males who
are intellectually impaired, but there are</p>
<p t="1890659" d="4490">also more males who are four and five standard
deviations above the population mean.</p>
<p t="1895149" d="5551">You don't need much of a difference in standard
deviation in order to produce radical differences</p>
<p t="1900700" d="1380">at the extreme.</p>
<p t="1902080" d="3459">So I'll give you an example.</p>
<p t="1905539" d="5401">Males are more aggressive than females among
humans, but the effect is only about half</p>
<p t="1910940" d="1209">a standard deviation.</p>
<p t="1912149" d="7620">And so what that means is that, if you take
a female and a male randomly from a population</p>
<p t="1919769" d="5071">and you were trying to guess who was the more
aggressive of the two, most of the time, you</p>
<p t="1924840" d="5350">know about 60% of the time, the male would
be more aggressive than the female, but 40%</p>
<p t="1930190" d="1260">of the time it would be reversed.</p>
<p t="1931450" d="2400">So you know, that's a lot of overlap.</p>
<p t="1933850" d="3539">But then here's the rub.</p>
<p t="1937389" d="5240">So let's say just for example, that among
the population of men and women combined,</p>
<p t="1942629" d="5620">only the most aggressive person out of a hundred
ends up in jail.</p>
<p t="1948249" d="1490">Those are all men.</p>
<p t="1949739" d="5890">Because that tilt towards aggression is enough,
so that when you go way out on the distribution,</p>
<p t="1955629" d="4191">the only people who are that extreme are men,
even though the population difference isn't</p>
<p t="1959820" d="1149">that great.</p>
<p t="1960969" d="6380">So anyways, there's a massive debate in
the relevant literature about the potential</p>
<p t="1967349" d="4120">consequences of that for things like cognitive
function, because there's some indication</p>
<p t="1971469" d="4930">as well that men are more cognitively specialised
but women are more cognitively robust.</p>
<p t="1976399" d="3840">Anyways, it doesn't really matter.</p>
<p t="1980239" d="4600">But what does matter is the fact of this permanent
dominance hierarchy.</p>
<p t="1984839" d="5800">Now, the dominance hierarchy, the male dominance
hierarchy, also has another feature.</p>
<p t="1990639" d="5210">So we already said that, you know, on average,
men are half as likely to leave offspring</p>
<p t="1995849" d="1440">as women are.</p>
<p t="1997289" d="6210">And so what that means is that all things
considered… this isn't…</p>
<p t="2003499" d="4680">I'm not trying to make this into a circular
argument.</p>
<p t="2008179" d="3191">Because I could say it's the more successful
males that leave more offspring.</p>
<p t="2011370" d="3589">But then you'd say, well that's the definition,
Darwinian definition, of success.</p>
<p t="2014959" d="4540">But I don't mean Darwinian success, because
that's self-evident.</p>
<p t="2019499" d="5180">What I mean is, if you look in the modern
world for example, and you try to predict</p>
<p t="2024679" d="6320">number of available sexual partners for a
given male, your best predictive measure of</p>
<p t="2030999" d="2351">that is income.</p>
<p t="2033350" d="4379">And the best predictive measure of that is
intelligence and conscientiousness.</p>
<p t="2037729" d="6980">And so, what happens is that males orient
themselves in groups, and then they compete.</p>
<p t="2044709" d="2340">And then women peel off the top.</p>
<p t="2047049" d="6880">And so the women are in a position of judgment
on men, and the judgment is the judgment of</p>
<p t="2053929" d="1000">nature.</p>
<p t="2054929" d="5650">Now, from a Darwinian perspective… you know,
when we think of nature we think of, well</p>
<p t="2060579" d="3711">it depends on who you are, but if you're
an environmentalist you think of a French</p>
<p t="2064290" d="5410">impressionist landscape, you know, forgetting
that nature is also malarial mosquitoes and</p>
<p t="2069700" d="5979">cancer, and rats infected with bubonic plague
and all those other lovely things.</p>
<p t="2075679" d="5900">But, from a Darwinian perspective, you can
define nature much more straight-forwardly,</p>
<p t="2081579" d="3251">and more accurately, as that which selects.</p>
<p t="2084830" d="5630">Now, you know, you hear a lot about natural
selection, and natural selection basically</p>
<p t="2090460" d="5720">assumes that there is a random distribution
of alteration in genetic structure, in any</p>
<p t="2096180" d="4240">population, in any generation.</p>
<p t="2100420" d="5020">And some of those random alterations will
be more suited to that particular environment,</p>
<p t="2105440" d="4300">suited being they'll live and they'll
reproduce.</p>
<p t="2109740" d="7210">And genetic transformation takes place across
the millennia as the organism chases the landscape,</p>
<p t="2116950" d="1000">roughly speaking.</p>
<p t="2117950" d="7720">But Darwin, you know, Darwin, who was an unbelievably
intelligent person, was also very, very interested</p>
<p t="2125670" d="4800">in sexual selection, and as far as Darwin
was concerned, sexual selection was just as</p>
<p t="2130470" d="8349">powerful in modifying genetic structure, in
driving evolution, as natural selection.</p>
<p t="2138819" d="2721">And that's been very underplayed by biologists.</p>
<p t="2141540" d="2730">That's only started to switch in the last…</p>
<p t="2144270" d="5060">I would say it hasn't switched that much
yet, but it started to switch probably in</p>
<p t="2149330" d="2090">about the last 25 years.</p>
<p t="2151420" d="7490">And that's because the idea of sexual selection
makes things a hell of a lot more complicated.</p>
<p t="2158910" d="5550">Because, well first of all, in a standard
Darwinian account of evolution, there's</p>
<p t="2164460" d="4290">no place for mind, there's no place for
a creator, there's no place for teleology.</p>
<p t="2168750" d="5329">And teleology is something moving towards
an end, a goal, right?</p>
<p t="2174079" d="8480">But the thing is, if sexual selection is operative,
and if consciousness is ancient, then mind</p>
<p t="2182559" d="4991">has been operating through sexual selection
as long as there's been sexual selection.</p>
<p t="2187550" d="6670">So you think, do you have any choice, do you
make any choice in who your sexual partner</p>
<p t="2194220" d="1000">will be?</p>
<p t="2195220" d="6160">And the answer to that is, well it's hardly
random, you make a choice!</p>
<p t="2201380" d="4660">And what's interesting is that, you know,
if you take 60 people, let's say if you</p>
<p t="2206040" d="3180">took 60 women, and you showed them a bunch
of men, and you asked them to rank them in</p>
<p t="2209220" d="4050">terms of their attractiveness, there's going
to be very consistent rankings.</p>
<p t="2213270" d="5220">You know, I mean, we know what makes up attractive
facial features, for women and for men, it's</p>
<p t="2218490" d="1039">easy to determine that.</p>
<p t="2219529" d="5481">What you do is you take 60 faces and you average
the features.</p>
<p t="2225010" d="4380">So you don't get the average person, because
the average person is more like a median,</p>
<p t="2229390" d="2040">you get the averaged person.</p>
<p t="2231430" d="5240">And the averaged person has perfectly symmetrical
features that are nicely shaped, and fairly</p>
<p t="2236670" d="5810">big eyes, and they're very nice-looking,
they're very attractive.</p>
<p t="2242480" d="6849">And so, that means that there's like a central
human form, in a sense, that we find attractive.</p>
<p t="2249329" d="4101">And we see this in other species, for example
there are butterflies who won't mate with</p>
<p t="2253430" d="5860">another butterfly if it's like a sixteenth
of an inch out of symmetry, because it's</p>
<p t="2259290" d="2370">not a butterfly of that type, you know.</p>
<p t="2261660" d="5899">And that's how people think too, if you
deviate from the averaged person, the less</p>
<p t="2267559" d="4081">canonically human you appear, and the less
attractive you appear.</p>
<p t="2271640" d="4110">And, you know, we're chasing this ideal
in some sense that's an emergent property</p>
<p t="2275750" d="2190">of the nature of our species.</p>
<p t="2277940" d="6680">And then, you know, there's certain physical
characteristics, wide shoulders in men, and</p>
<p t="2284620" d="1000">narrow waists.</p>
<p t="2285620" d="4399">In women, it's waist-to-hip ratio, a very
common marker of beauty, across cultures,</p>
<p t="2290019" d="3090">and across body types, interestingly enough.</p>
<p t="2293109" d="5781">So, if you take thin women and heavier women,
and you get men to rate the attractiveness</p>
<p t="2298890" d="4540">of the women within that category, the heavy
women and the light women who have a waist-to-hip</p>
<p t="2303430" d="4320">ratio of about 0.68 are the ones that are
judged most attractive physically.</p>
<p t="2307750" d="5309">And so, that actually correlates, by the way,
with fertility, because the abdominal fat</p>
<p t="2313059" d="5731">in a young woman is a sign of ill health and
also a marker of decreased likelihood of conception.</p>
<p t="2318790" d="4940">Now none of this is operating consciously,
obviously, it's deeply wired into us, it's</p>
<p t="2323730" d="3049">part of our mediate perception.</p>
<p t="2326779" d="5441">But it still does indicate that there's
an ideal, like a platonic ideal, lurking at</p>
<p t="2332220" d="4290">the back of our minds, against whom we compare
everyone that we meet.</p>
<p t="2336510" d="4240">And then you might say, well what's the
nature of that platonic ideal, and that's</p>
<p t="2340750" d="2670">a very, very complicated question.</p>
<p t="2343420" d="10149">You know, I would say that you could almost
literally claim that the… well you can certainly</p>
<p t="2353569" d="8841">claim that the ideal male is represented in
mythology as a hero.</p>
<p t="2362410" d="3540">And that's actually what mythology is about,
it's about representing ideal patterns of</p>
<p t="2365950" d="2500">behaviour, so it's hardly surprising.</p>
<p t="2368450" d="4940">And so, you know, if you go to a movie, and
it's a romance, and there's the main lead</p>
<p t="2373390" d="4310">character that you're supposed to fall in
love with (if you happen to be the kind of</p>
<p t="2377700" d="6300">person that would fall in love with that kind
of person), then he's going to act out a</p>
<p t="2384000" d="1700">particular pattern of behaviour.</p>
<p t="2385700" d="2580">And the pattern of behaviour is quite identifiable.</p>
<p t="2388280" d="5110">So for example he's going to move forward
and explore, and not hide and cower.</p>
<p t="2393390" d="3260">And the probability that he's going to be
creative is very high, and the probability</p>
<p t="2396650" d="3350">that he's going to be good-looking and strong
is very high.</p>
<p t="2400000" d="3420">And so, those are archetypal features.</p>
<p t="2403420" d="6030">And those aren't all the archetypal features,
because those are, in some sense, those are</p>
<p t="2409450" d="2080">the self-evident ones.</p>
<p t="2411530" d="5009">But you know, people are also evaluating each
other for things like intelligence, and personality,</p>
<p t="2416539" d="1780">and character.</p>
<p t="2418319" d="6561">And you could say in some sense that men are
competing to be the best man, and women are</p>
<p t="2424880" d="4909">watching the competition to take the man who
wins on the presupposition that he wouldn't</p>
<p t="2429789" d="1240">win if he wasn't the best man.</p>
<p t="2431029" d="3171">It's a very, very intelligent strategy.</p>
<p t="2434200" d="2500">Because why not outsource the problem.</p>
<p t="2436700" d="5609">Let the men sort it out, well as I say, it's
too cognitively complex to compute.</p>
<p t="2442309" d="3550">You could say that the male dominance hierarchy
is equivalent to the stock market.</p>
<p t="2445859" d="2750">It's exactly equivalent to the stock market.</p>
<p t="2448609" d="6200">The stocks are always competing with one another,
and with every other commodity, for primacy</p>
<p t="2454809" d="4851">of price and value, and that's exactly what
happens with male competition.</p>
<p t="2459660" d="4470">So one of the things that we've just discovered
in my lab, this is Caitlyn Burton's work,</p>
<p t="2464130" d="5290">it's very cool, is that we took… we were
trying to understand the fundamental sub-structure</p>
<p t="2469420" d="3980">of conservatism vs. liberalism.</p>
<p t="2473400" d="5040">And I'm going to speak in terms of conservatism,
because that's how we construed the data,</p>
<p t="2478440" d="2599">although we could've done the reverse if
we were going to construe liberalism.</p>
<p t="2481039" d="4742">And what we did was we took, we got a bunch
of people to sit down and write down a bunch</p>
<p t="2485781" d="4449">of statements that they though conservatives
vs. liberals would disagree with.</p>
<p t="2490230" d="3539">You know, I think we had, I don't remember
how many statements, 300 statements, something</p>
<p t="2493769" d="1000">like that.</p>
<p t="2494769" d="3391">We had a lot of people generate them and take
them from news items and so forth, because</p>
<p t="2498160" d="4770">we didn't want any bias in the initial question
set.</p>
<p t="2502930" d="5360">Or we didn't want a bias that wasn't there
in the actual world.</p>
<p t="2508290" d="4819">So we had many people do this, and then we
gave these questions to many, many people</p>
<p t="2513109" d="3440">online, in a variety of stages.</p>
<p t="2516549" d="6901">And we extracted those out that seemed to
best fit the data, and then assessed them</p>
<p t="2523450" d="4240">for the utility in predicting things like
party membership or voting behaviour.</p>
<p t="2527690" d="3460">And so we got a good structure, it makes a
lot of sense, and what we found with regards</p>
<p t="2531150" d="7330">to conservatism was that there was an ethnocentrism
factor, it was the third and weakest factor,</p>
<p t="2538480" d="4650">and that would be associated with in-group
preference vs. out-group derogation.</p>
<p t="2543130" d="6570">So those are anti-immigrant people, fundamentally,
you know, and they're, well they're ethnocentric.</p>
<p t="2549700" d="6720">That's the simplest way to explain it.</p>
<p t="2556420" d="6220">And then the second smallest factor was religious
traditionalism.</p>
<p t="2562640" d="4000">And most of this was done with Americans,
for a variety of reasons.</p>
<p t="2566640" d="2969">And that was really where the fundamentalist
Christians nested.</p>
<p t="2569609" d="7781">And not everyone… that was not only a factor
made up of fundamentalist Christian beliefs,</p>
<p t="2577390" d="2310">but they loaded heavily.</p>
<p t="2579700" d="4309">Those were people who weren't for stem cell
research, they were anti-abortion, they were</p>
<p t="2584009" d="2100">anti-gay marriage.</p>
<p t="2586109" d="4460">Or they were pro-traditional, which is how
they see themselves.</p>
<p t="2590569" d="8450">And then, the largest factor was a factor
that we called ‘masculine independence'.</p>
<p t="2599019" d="6070">And it was more characteristic of men, and
what it basically consisted of was an attitude</p>
<p t="2605089" d="3701">that winners win and losers lose, and that's
just how it should be.</p>
<p t="2608790" d="7739">So it was the men who… the personality predictors,
one of them was extroverted assertiveness…</p>
<p t="2616529" d="7810">hunting and the right to own firearms also
loaded on this factor, but it was masculine</p>
<p t="2624339" d="4431">competitiveness, I think, is the best way
of thinking about it.</p>
<p t="2628770" d="7240">And I think it's a good illustration of
the kind of individual attitude that makes</p>
<p t="2636010" d="4839">you more likely to attempt to climb up dominance
hierarchies and dominate them from the top</p>
<p t="2640849" d="1000">down.</p>
<p t="2641849" d="3551">And that's not necessarily something that
would be associated with factors like compassion.</p>
<p t="2645400" d="4350">Well, I'll leave it at that.</p>
<p t="2649750" d="1869">It's just that you can see…</p>
<p t="2651619" d="4571">I'm telling you that because you can see
how these proclivities manifest themselves</p>
<p t="2656190" d="2530">in all sorts of areas of behaviour.</p>
<p t="2658720" d="6580">I can tell you something else that's very
interesting about men and violence.</p>
<p t="2665300" d="14630">I don't know if I can get this story straight
because it's been a while since I told it.</p>
<p t="2679930" d="6909">So there's this interesting phenomenon,
that's very characteristic of societies,</p>
<p t="2686839" d="4151">I believe pretty much everywhere it's been
studied.</p>
<p t="2690990" d="3579">Now, you can calculate an index called the
Gini coefficient.</p>
<p t="2694569" d="6210">And the Gini coefficient is a number that
represents how much inequality of income distribution</p>
<p t="2700779" d="2310">there is in a given geographical area.</p>
<p t="2703089" d="6691">So you could calculate a Gini coefficient
for a street or an area in a city, or a city,</p>
<p t="2709780" d="3270">or a state, or a country, you can do it at
all those levels.</p>
<p t="2713050" d="5640">And what you find is that, you know you always
hear this idea that poverty causes crime.</p>
<p t="2718690" d="2110">That's a classic left-wing idea.</p>
<p t="2720800" d="3410">But it's wrong, it's seriously wrong.</p>
<p t="2724210" d="1570">And it's importantly wrong.</p>
<p t="2725780" d="3670">And it's definitively wrong, not only that.</p>
<p t="2729450" d="3559">So there's no argument about this, it's
already been established.</p>
<p t="2733009" d="5000">What causes crime, especially aggressive crime,
is relative poverty, and relative poverty</p>
<p t="2738009" d="2090">is not the same thing as poverty at all.</p>
<p t="2740099" d="2260">It's seriously not the same thing.</p>
<p t="2742359" d="2051">Poverty is when you don't have enough to
eat.</p>
<p t="2744410" d="5109">Relative poverty is when the guy next door
has a much better car than you.</p>
<p t="2749519" d="3461">And there's lots of relative poverty in
the United States, and there's some absolute</p>
<p t="2752980" d="4200">poverty, but even the absolute poverty in
the United States is nothing like the absolute</p>
<p t="2757180" d="5300">poverty say in places like India or sub-Saharan
Africa, where absolute poverty means you have</p>
<p t="2762480" d="1000">nothing.</p>
<p t="2763480" d="5950">Now, what's really interesting about the
Gini coefficient is that if you go to places</p>
<p t="2769430" d="6220">where everyone, roughly speaking, is poor,
say by national standards…</p>
<p t="2775650" d="5690">I think South Dakota was often used as an
example, or maybe one of the Maritime Provinces…</p>
<p t="2781340" d="5090">like Newfoundland, where there's low average
income but it's pretty flat distribution,</p>
<p t="2786430" d="2600">there's almost no crime.</p>
<p t="2789030" d="5610">And if you go to places where everyone's
rich then there's almost no crime.</p>
<p t="2794640" d="5560">But if you go places where there's poor
people and moderately well-off people, and</p>
<p t="2800200" d="5680">rich people, and the distribution is really
steep, then the rate of aggressive behaviour</p>
<p t="2805880" d="4590">among young men, and it's usually within
their own ethnic group, starts to sky-rocket</p>
<p t="2810470" d="1950">out of control.</p>
<p t="2812420" d="4780">And the reason for that seems to be that,
if the dominance hierarchy is too steep, then</p>
<p t="2817200" d="6190">the young men have no likelihood of climbing
to a dominant position while playing the standard</p>
<p t="2823390" d="1399">social game.</p>
<p t="2824789" d="4970">And so what they do is turn to aggression,
to make their mark on the world.</p>
<p t="2829759" d="2280">And it works, too, that's the other thing.</p>
<p t="2832039" d="5211">Make no mistake about it, if you're looking
for status where status is hard to achieve,</p>
<p t="2837250" d="5500">and you're the meanest, toughest guy around,
and, you know, around a bunch of people who,</p>
<p t="2842750" d="4069">like you, don't have much money, then you're
going to benefit from that status.</p>
<p t="2846819" d="1000">It works.</p>
<p t="2847819" d="1000">Yeah?</p>
<p t="2848819" d="4691">Would that be part of the reason why… because
I know that, I think that violent crime rate</p>
<p t="2853510" d="5430">in the US is higher than it is in Canada,
would that be part of the reason why?</p>
<p t="2858940" d="5480">Sure, yeah, I mean you can make a real conservative
argument for making sure that, you know that</p>
<p t="2864420" d="4030">conservatives are very anti-income distribution,
and we figure that's because of the guys</p>
<p t="2868450" d="4889">that have this male independence, you know
they have this male independence factor, they</p>
<p t="2873339" d="3731">don't want to be distributing resources
to people who are down the dominance hierarchy</p>
<p t="2877070" d="2620">because they want them down the dominance
hierarchy!</p>
<p t="2879690" d="4159">They want there to be a difference between
the people on top and the people on the bottom,</p>
<p t="2883849" d="4211">so that they can be the people on top, so
that it increases their relative attractiveness.</p>
<p t="2888060" d="3110">Like it's a perfectly logical game.</p>
<p t="2891170" d="4510">And they presume that, well the rules are
set up, and like every man can go for it,</p>
<p t="2895680" d="4300">do his best, and the winner wins and the loser
loses, and that's just how it is, and “don't</p>
<p t="2899980" d="2400">ask me to fix it because I don't want to.</p>
<p t="2902380" d="6189">And besides that I find it distasteful to
attempt to fix it”, more than that, right,</p>
<p t="2908569" d="5671">because it's a moral issue, it's not just
an intellectual issue.</p>
<p t="2914240" d="5309">So you can make a case, however, from the
conservative point of view, especially with</p>
<p t="2919549" d="6050">regards to, say, beliefs in religious traditionalism,
and the desire to maintain social stability,</p>
<p t="2925599" d="3881">that you shouldn't let income distribution
become too unequal.</p>
<p t="2929480" d="4279">Like one of the big things your society has
to do is to make sure that doesn't get out</p>
<p t="2933759" d="4500">of hand, because it tends to get out of hand,
it tends towards a few people having everything</p>
<p t="2938259" d="3360">and almost everyone else having nothing.</p>
<p t="2941619" d="4920">In a sense, it's a natural consequence of
economic progression, which is actually something</p>
<p t="2946539" d="1391">that Marx pointed out.</p>
<p t="2947930" d="3970">Although an Italian named Pareto had figured
it out at approximately the same time, and</p>
<p t="2951900" d="3540">I think with a lot more conceptual clarity.</p>
<p t="2955440" d="5919">But, the more unequal you let your society
get, the higher the probability of death,</p>
<p t="2961359" d="2650">roughly speaking, through violent causes.</p>
<p t="2964009" d="8021">But I'm telling you why it is that, you
know, men want to climb the dominance hierarchy,</p>
<p t="2972030" d="1910">and the reason they want to climb the dominance
hierarchy is that they get access to women.</p>
<p t="2973940" d="3099">I was going to, actually ask earlier in the
discussion, when you were talking about the</p>
<p t="2977039" d="10000">familiar and the unfamiliar and the structure.</p>
<p t="2987039" d="5885">So it seems like we all want to live within
a structure, but we don't want the rules</p>
<p t="2992924" d="1000">to apply to ourselves.</p>
<p t="2993924" d="2516">Well, we have this contradictory problem,
we want to be protected by the structure but</p>
<p t="2996440" d="2569">we want to advance our position within it.</p>
<p t="2999009" d="5631">And so that means, what that should mean,
and this is I think the definition of civilised</p>
<p t="3004640" d="4429">behaviour, is that you're allowed to advance
your position within the structure as long</p>
<p t="3009069" d="3461">as you don't disrupt it negatively.</p>
<p t="3012530" d="1600">And I think that most people do do that.</p>
<p t="3014130" d="6949">In fact I think people in civilised countries
do that so effectively that it's an absolute,</p>
<p t="3021079" d="2161">incomprehensible miracle.</p>
<p t="3023240" d="3690">I can't understand how or why it ever got
established.</p>
<p t="3026930" d="4410">But like a psychopath will climb the ladder
and cut the rungs off underneath him, fundamentally.</p>
<p t="3031340" d="4370">He doesn't even care if the damn thing maintains
itself.</p>
<p t="3035710" d="4899">You know, he's perfectly willing to have
it destroyed after he's exhausted it.</p>
<p t="3040609" d="4831">But if everyone acted like that or even if
a substantial number of people acted like</p>
<p t="3045440" d="5720">that, the whole thing would come to a halt,
virtually in no time flat.</p>
<p t="3051160" d="11260">So I mean, why… see, you might… here's
a reason… you know, because one of the things</p>
<p t="3062420" d="2560">we were talking about is masculine violence.</p>
<p t="3064980" d="3809">Now the thing about masculine violence is
that it only tends to emerge in situations</p>
<p t="3068789" d="8191">where there don't seem to be any other reasonably
viable means of advancing status.</p>
<p t="3076980" d="3319">So it's not reasonable to say that men are
aggressive.</p>
<p t="3080299" d="3641">You can say that on average men are more aggressive
than women.</p>
<p t="3083940" d="6100">And you can also say that if you put men in
a situation where they have no, where they</p>
<p t="3090040" d="6351">can see status differences but they have no
means of moving forward, that they're likely</p>
<p t="3096391" d="4569">to turn to aggression as a way of establishing
dominance.</p>
<p t="3100960" d="4829">And then you can say that, the reason for
that is that it makes them more attractive,</p>
<p t="3105789" d="1820">the fundamental reason.</p>
<p t="3107609" d="1260">Yeah?</p>
<p t="3108869" d="12704">Yeah, I'd just like to add on, I read this
article once that talks about how polygamous</p>
<p t="3121573" d="1000">societies are more violent than monogamous
ones.</p>
<p t="3122573" d="1000">Yeah, absolutely.</p>
<p t="3123573" d="1000">I was going to say maybe it's because when
one guy has two wives that means that 50%</p>
<p t="3124573" d="1000">of the population has no wives, no access
to sex.</p>
<p t="3125573" d="2977">Yeah that's exactly right, the evolutionary
psychology explanation for the pathology of</p>
<p t="3128550" d="4330">polygamy is that once you let it establish
itself then then men get ultra-violent.</p>
<p t="3132880" d="5250">So would you say that monogamy would almost
be a basis for civilised society?</p>
<p t="3138130" d="4130">Many people have said that, and yes I think
you can make a strong case for that.</p>
<p t="3142260" d="3400">And I think the fundamental reason is the
one you just pointed out.</p>
<p t="3145660" d="8419">You know the idea is, well, would you rather
have one woman, or die, you know?</p>
<p t="3154079" d="4701">Sorry no, that's not quite right.</p>
<p t="3158780" d="5479">It's more like, would you be willing to
limit yourself to one partner or have a shot</p>
<p t="3164259" d="3691">at many partners but a much higher probability
of dying.</p>
<p t="3167950" d="3049">Right, and you know, some guys will take that.</p>
<p t="3170999" d="3571">They'll take the high-risk approach.</p>
<p t="3174570" d="5880">So now, this doesn't eliminate the difference
in individual differences in determining who's</p>
<p t="3180450" d="4790">going to be aggressive, because what will
happen is that as the Gini coefficient pressure</p>
<p t="3185240" d="5170">rises, the more aggressive men, the men who
are more aggressive by nature, will get more</p>
<p t="3190410" d="1260">aggressive first.</p>
<p t="3191670" d="3389">So you can imagine, it's a threshold phenomenon,
in some sense.</p>
<p t="3195059" d="4661">And what I should tell you as well is that
the relationship between the Gini coefficient</p>
<p t="3199720" d="6770">and male-on-male homicide isn't 0.2 or 0.3,
which is the correlation that you'd get</p>
<p t="3206490" d="2950">if you were predicting something like that
using personality.</p>
<p t="3209440" d="2159">It's like 0.8 or 0.9.</p>
<p t="3211599" d="4141">It's like it eats up all of it, it's the
explanation.</p>
<p t="3215740" d="4829">So it's a huge effect, it's so big an
effect that you can basically say that oh</p>
<p t="3220569" d="1220">well, we figured that out.</p>
<p t="3221789" d="4210">Although psychologists never know when they've
figured anything out, and they keep endlessly</p>
<p t="3225999" d="3641">retesting it over and over and over, because
you know, we don't know how to bring our</p>
<p t="3229640" d="1260">science to a stop.</p>
<p t="3230900" d="4209">But if you don't accept the Gini coefficient-aggression
data, that's like, you might as well throw</p>
<p t="3235109" d="6000">the rest of social sciences out the window,
because the effect is unbelievably powerful.</p>
<p t="3241109" d="2841">What geographical area does this take place
in?</p>
<p t="3243950" d="4020">It depends… you can do it on any level of
analysis.</p>
<p t="3247970" d="4460">You can do it by county, you can do it by
city, you can do it by state, and you can</p>
<p t="3252430" d="2510">do it by country, and it works on all of those
levels</p>
<p t="3254940" d="3220">Student: Like, it predicts aggression, almost?</p>
<p t="3258160" d="1080">You bet.</p>
<p t="3259240" d="1000">Yeah.</p>
<p t="3260240" d="1000">And that's a great question.</p>
<p t="3261240" d="6430">I mean, the methodologically sophisticated
studies have done exactly that, to ensure</p>
<p t="3267670" d="3639">that it's actually this phenomenon rather
than other factors that might be operative</p>
<p t="3271309" d="2571">in that particular geographical area.</p>
<p t="3273880" d="4989">So countries with a higher Gini coefficient
are more violent, and cities within that country</p>
<p t="3278869" d="3940">that have a higher than average Gini coefficient
for that country are more violent on average.</p>
<p t="3282809" d="3441">It's a very, very robust finding.</p>
<p t="3286250" d="9849">Alright, so we're going to say, for the
sake of argument, that you've got the male</p>
<p t="3296099" d="3770">dominance hierarchy, and it's represented
as masculine.</p>
<p t="3299869" d="5631">Now, one of the things Jung said, now he thought
that women carried an image of men in their</p>
<p t="3305500" d="1049">unconscious.</p>
<p t="3306549" d="6000">And he thought that the image that women carried
of men in their unconscious was a group of</p>
<p t="3312549" d="1911">men, not an individual man.</p>
<p t="3314460" d="2760">He called that the animus.</p>
<p t="3317220" d="6000">Whereas he believed that the image of women
that men carried in their collective unconscious</p>
<p t="3323220" d="3470">was of a single woman, and he called that
the anima.</p>
<p t="3326690" d="5000">Now I'm just telling you that, I'm not
going to justify it, or even discuss it, but</p>
<p t="3331690" d="4500">I just want you to keep that in the back of
your mind.</p>
<p t="3336190" d="5760">So I guess part of the reason I'm telling
you that, come to think of it, is that I think</p>
<p t="3341950" d="6409">it may provide some insight into why the idea
of the patriarchy has become such a well-accepted</p>
<p t="3348359" d="2450">notion.</p>
<p t="3350809" d="3151">Because it is an archetypal notion, but it's
a one-sided archetypal notion.</p>
<p t="3353960" d="4210">Okay, so back to sexual selection.</p>
<p t="3358170" d="6649">Now, we already talked about the fact that
biologists perhaps were uncomfortable with</p>
<p t="3364819" d="5311">the idea of sexual selection, because it brings
a non-random factor into evolution.</p>
<p t="3370130" d="7369">A seriously non-random factor, because you
have to go back as far as you can in history</p>
<p t="3377499" d="5520">to where there was no choice, on the part
of the organism, to attribute evolution to</p>
<p t="3383019" d="1970">natural selection alone.</p>
<p t="3384989" d="3691">And you have to go back a long ways back,
as I said, even butterflies are perfectly</p>
<p t="3388680" d="4369">capable of distinguishing between a high-quality
butterfly partner, in butterfly terms, and</p>
<p t="3393049" d="1931">a low-quality butterfly partner.</p>
<p t="3394980" d="5150">And you know, insects have been around for
a very, very long time.</p>
<p t="3400130" d="5689">So we have no idea, what that actually means
is that we have no idea what role choice has</p>
<p t="3405819" d="3000">made in the evolutionary process.</p>
<p t="3408819" d="3980">But one thing that you can infer is that the
reason human beings are the way they are now,</p>
<p t="3412799" d="7961">and not like chimps or human ancestors, is
because the sexual selection process got started,</p>
<p t="3420760" d="2059">and it was intense.</p>
<p t="3422819" d="2851">And so, as a consequence of that, here we
are.</p>
<p t="3425670" d="1909">And so, you know, maybe it was a good thing.</p>
<p t="3427579" d="3391">Although it's very hard, in some sense,
on all those people who failed.</p>
<p t="3430970" d="6760">And that's, you know, roughly speaking,
twice as many men as women.</p>
<p t="3437730" d="5490">So then that all raises the question, like
who exactly is responsible for the male dominance</p>
<p t="3443220" d="1000">hierarchy?</p>
<p t="3444220" d="3260">Because you could say it's male competitiveness,
but you could also say, yeah well it's an</p>
<p t="3447480" d="3330">inevitable function of female selection.</p>
<p t="3450810" d="2940">Which is not an argument that you hear very
often.</p>
<p t="3453750" d="2369">But I think it's a very difficult argument
to escape from.</p>
<p t="3456119" d="1611">And that leads us to our next hypothesis.</p>
<p t="3457730" d="5510">So we're going to say that the masculine
dominance hierarchy is represented as masculine.</p>
<p t="3463240" d="2549">I'm going to call that The Great Father
for the time being.</p>
<p t="3465789" d="5361">And that's the permanent dominance hierarchy
of men, and it's always there, it moves</p>
<p t="3471150" d="1000">through history.</p>
<p t="3472150" d="4730">It's different men all the time, but the
men slot in and out as they are born and die,</p>
<p t="3476880" d="4229">but the structure itself stays intact across…
forever.</p>
<p t="3481109" d="1470">It's always there.</p>
<p t="3482579" d="4231">It's been there at least for millions of
years, so for our purposes we'll just call</p>
<p t="3486810" d="1000">it permanent.</p>
<p t="3487810" d="3870">It's a permanent part of experience, and
it's a big part of it.</p>
<p t="3491680" d="7010">And you know, as culture gets more and more…
covers larger and larger expanses of territory,</p>
<p t="3498690" d="4200">gets more and more sophisticated, it's an
ever larger part of reality.</p>
<p t="3502890" d="7929">I mean, most of us spend almost all our time
coping with the dominance hierarchy, and almost</p>
<p t="3510819" d="2071">none of our time combatting nature.</p>
<p t="3512890" d="5419">You know, you get wet for a little while and
that's it, you know, but most of the problems</p>
<p t="3518309" d="5720">that you would face in a purely natural environment,
you're so distant from them that you could</p>
<p t="3524029" d="3851">hardly imagine, you can't even imagine what
it would be like, in some sense, to be in</p>
<p t="3527880" d="1000">an environment like that.</p>
<p t="3528880" d="1000">Yeah?</p>
<p t="3529880" d="1000">I have a question.</p>
<p t="3530880" d="1000">Like your explanation of what drives men to
become competitive and vindictive of the hierarchy…</p>
<p t="3531880" d="1000">what drives women?</p>
<p t="3532880" d="1000">Like for example there's an aggressive nature
of women and there's some sort of competitiveness</p>
<p t="3533880" d="1000">in women, let's say at the University of
Toronto.</p>
<p t="3534880" d="10310">So </p>
<p t="3545190" d="4200">what is driving women to try to elevate their
level in the hierarchy?</p>
<p t="3549390" d="1000">Well, that's a good question.</p>
<p t="3550390" d="3330">So the way I would answer that question is
two-fold.</p>
<p t="3553720" d="5799">So the question was what drives women to move
to the top of the hierarchy?</p>
<p t="3559519" d="4570">It's something that's worth discussing.</p>
<p t="3564089" d="3861">So if anybody objects to what I'm going
to say, then please do, because I'm not,</p>
<p t="3567950" d="3149">you know, dishing this out as received truth,
it's…</p>
<p t="3571099" d="3311">I've been trying to figure this out and
this is what it looks like to me.</p>
<p t="3574410" d="3570">The first thing is that I think there are…
male and female dominance hierarchies both</p>
<p t="3577980" d="2299">exist but they're different.</p>
<p t="3580279" d="5241">And that females compete with each other intensely,
but they don't compete for the same things,</p>
<p t="3585520" d="2680">and they don't compete the same way.</p>
<p t="3588200" d="6580">So let me tell you a little story, this is
a bit of a divergence, but it's an interesting</p>
<p t="3594780" d="1000">point.</p>
<p t="3595780" d="3110">And one of the questions I've always been
asked in this class… because I'm going</p>
<p t="3598890" d="5580">to lay out a hero story, and the fundamental
hero archetype, and the hero is masculine</p>
<p t="3604470" d="3930">in mythology… and so the women always ask,
well what about the role of the woman?</p>
<p t="3608400" d="3689">And it's like, it's very, very complex,
which of course, all you women already know,</p>
<p t="3612089" d="1750">because it is very, very complex.</p>
<p t="3613839" d="4200">But it isn't something that… first of
all I don't think it's a question that</p>
<p t="3618039" d="4751">would've been asked before the invention
of the birth control pill.</p>
<p t="3622790" d="4470">Because we know what the archetypal female
is, prior to that.</p>
<p t="3627260" d="3450">It's the Virgin Mary with child, it's
a virgin with child.</p>
<p t="3630710" d="4869">Which means that the unit for woman is ‘woman
with child'.</p>
<p t="3635579" d="2520">It's not woman, it's woman with child.</p>
<p t="3638099" d="6760">And, well, it's obvious why that is, because
as soon as you become a woman, in most societies,</p>
<p t="3644859" d="1401">you have a child.</p>
<p t="3646260" d="6349">Before that, you're a girl, and that's,
you know, that's in some sense irrelevant,</p>
<p t="3652609" d="1781">in terms of your destiny.</p>
<p t="3654390" d="6200">Now you might say, well what's your archetypal
pattern if you're not a mother?</p>
<p t="3660590" d="7590">Well, the way it looks to me is that there's
two archetypes for personal development, for</p>
<p t="3668180" d="1990">the personal path, roughly speaking.</p>
<p t="3670170" d="5800">There's the hero, and that would be the
person that explores the unknown and discovers</p>
<p t="3675970" d="3460">something of value and brings it back and
distributes it to the community.</p>
<p t="3679430" d="7780">So it's like a hunting… it's probably
predicated on a hunting platform, because</p>
<p t="3687210" d="4240">our bodies are hunting platforms, basically.</p>
<p t="3691450" d="4720">And one theory about what men did, which is
a very probable theory, is that they went</p>
<p t="3696170" d="1169">out and hunted for meat.</p>
<p t="3697339" d="2891">And chimps like meat, they'll eat it whenever
they can, although they're not very good</p>
<p t="3700230" d="1000">hunters.</p>
<p t="3701230" d="1000">But they will definitely eat meat.</p>
<p t="3702230" d="4289">And human beings are so good at hunting that
we probably… well, for example, we probably</p>
<p t="3706519" d="1570">wiped out the mammoths.</p>
<p t="3708089" d="4581">And when human beings came into North America,
there were as many different kinds of large</p>
<p t="3712670" d="4689">animal in North America as there were in Africa,
and human beings killed all of them.</p>
<p t="3717359" d="5851">And that was just with… you know, like they
didn't have our notion of technologically</p>
<p t="3723210" d="4010">sophisticated weapons, it was bows and arrows
and clubs and spears.</p>
<p t="3727220" d="4960">Nonetheless, they got rid of everything, you
know.</p>
<p t="3732180" d="8090">Large cats, giant beavers, mammoths… we're
very, very, very, very dangerous.</p>
<p t="3740270" d="8779">Anyways, there's another archetype, I would
say it's a maternal archetype in a sense,</p>
<p t="3749049" d="3081">and one of the things that's very interesting
about human males is that they're quite</p>
<p t="3752130" d="3639">maternal, by comparison to other animals.</p>
<p t="3755769" d="7381">So for example, the mother bear doesn't
have the male bear, the boar… is it boars</p>
<p t="3763150" d="1300">and sows with bears?</p>
<p t="3764450" d="1290">I think it is.</p>
<p t="3765740" d="2859">Anyways, you keep the cub away from the male,
because he'll kill them.</p>
<p t="3768599" d="8760">Now, not all males will do that but many will,
they don't have any filial attachment.</p>
<p t="3777359" d="5081">And that's the case for many but not all
complex mammals.</p>
<p t="3782440" d="10720">Pair bonding on a permanent basis is relatively
rare, but joint provision of children, that's</p>
<p t="3793160" d="1540">exceedingly rare.</p>
<p t="3794700" d="2379">And men are pretty good at taking care of
children.</p>
<p t="3797079" d="2921">I would say they're not as good at taking
care of infants as women are, because they</p>
<p t="3800000" d="3740">don't have the full range of resources at
hand.</p>
<p t="3803740" d="7379">And they're not, I don't think they have
the same kind of immediate intuitive understanding</p>
<p t="3811119" d="3870">of, or attraction to, babies that women have.</p>
<p t="3814989" d="5221">I think that switch is around the age of two
or two and a half, when the kids can engage</p>
<p t="3820210" d="1980">in rough-and-tumble play.</p>
<p t="3822190" d="4690">Because men are much more likely to engage
in rough-and-tumble play than women are, and</p>
<p t="3826880" d="4479">rough-and-tumble play seems to be one of the
things that civilises children.</p>
<p t="3831359" d="3510">And it's partly because, you know one of
the things you have to learn when you're</p>
<p t="3834869" d="5470">a child is what actually hurts you and what
can be ignored, and what actually hurts someone</p>
<p t="3840339" d="1791">else and what can be ignored.</p>
<p t="3842130" d="2340">And the best way to learn that is in rough-and-tumble
play.</p>
<p t="3844470" d="4129">Because what happens is that if you're playing
with a kid, they get more and more excited</p>
<p t="3848599" d="4000">and they do more and more crazy things, until
they do something that either hurts them or</p>
<p t="3852599" d="3861">hurts you, and then you have to say, look,
you can't do that.</p>
<p t="3856460" d="4309">And it's like a dance in a sense, you know,
when you're playing with a kid.</p>
<p t="3860769" d="4480">And you have to let them win fairly frequently,
because otherwise they don't continue the</p>
<p t="3865249" d="1000">game.</p>
<p t="3866249" d="3451">And you can tell that because if the game
is going well then they're laughing with</p>
<p t="3869700" d="4599">insane life, because kids just love rough-and-tumble
play.</p>
<p t="3874299" d="4961">And they love crazy things and catch them
and they think that's just great.</p>
<p t="3879260" d="3660">But partly what you're doing is you're
extending their body in all sorts of ways</p>
<p t="3882920" d="5919">and getting them to learn, in an embodied
sense, where their limits are and where the</p>
<p t="3888839" d="1160">limits of other people are.</p>
<p t="3889999" d="1000">And that's embodied.</p>
<p t="3890999" d="4401">And children who haven't had that, man they're
just so awkward, it's unbelievable.</p>
<p t="3895400" d="4020">You know, they might have some hypothetical
sense of how to interact with another person,</p>
<p t="3899420" d="3810">but they don't have an embodied sense of
it, and they can't tell the difference between</p>
<p t="3903230" d="1520">what hurts them and what doesn't.</p>
<p t="3904750" d="4660">Because often a young child, if they're
startled, they'll start to cry.</p>
<p t="3909410" d="3830">And then you can say, well that didn't hurt,
and then they'll notice, well yeah it didn't</p>
<p t="3913240" d="1390">hurt, and they'll stop crying.</p>
<p t="3914630" d="5689">But if they haven't had their limits tested,
they'll cry at anything unexpected, even</p>
<p t="3920319" d="1000">if it doesn't hurt.</p>
<p t="3921319" d="4690">And that's not good, because if you cry
under all conditions the probability that</p>
<p t="3926009" d="2411">you'll make friends when you're three
is zero.</p>
<p t="3928420" d="3530">Because another kid will start playing with
you and maybe playing rough, and if you burst</p>
<p t="3931950" d="4799">into tears, you know, several times, the kid's
just going to go somewhere else and find a</p>
<p t="3936749" d="1000">different playmate.</p>
<p t="3937749" d="1770">You know, they'll say you're just a baby.</p>
<p t="3939519" d="7881">Which is roughly, exactly accurate… roughly
exactly [laughter]… roughly accurate!</p>
<p t="3947400" d="5020">Anyways, back to the archetypal representation.</p>
<p t="3952420" d="5740">I think really the way to think about it is
that for men, the hero archetype is the archetype</p>
<p t="3958160" d="5270">that's dominant and in the forefront, and
the maternal archetype is subordinate and</p>
<p t="3963430" d="2879">in the background, I mean inside their own
psyches.</p>
<p t="3966309" d="2391">Whereas with women it's reversed.</p>
<p t="3968700" d="4720">So each of the genders can play the role of
the other gender but there's a tilt in each</p>
<p t="3973420" d="4389">of them towards the… what would you say?</p>
<p t="3977809" d="6831">Well I would say towards typical gender-normative
behaviour.</p>
<p t="3984640" d="3860">Now the social constructivists believe that
no such thing exists, but those people are</p>
<p t="3988500" d="4150">so pathological that even considering what
they have to say is a mistake.</p>
<p t="3992650" d="6939">So, you know they act as if there is no biology
and everything's cultural, and it's like,</p>
<p t="3999589" d="2500">well no, that's just not right.</p>
<p t="4002089" d="4842">Now what biology means in practice and what
you should do about it, that's a whole different</p>
<p t="4006931" d="4368">question, but to think of all these differences
as socially… height differences between</p>
<p t="4011299" d="4070">men and women are not socially constructed,
and they're relevant.</p>
<p t="4015369" d="4140">And the upper-body strength differences between
men and women are not socially constructed,</p>
<p t="4019509" d="2760">and they're relevant too!</p>
<p t="4022269" d="3871">So one of the things I was wondering about,
maybe you guys can help me clarify this or</p>
<p t="4026140" d="4439">tell me where I'm not thinking about this
properly, and if you think there's any…</p>
<p t="4030579" d="3720">if I'm missing something let me know.</p>
<p t="4034299" d="5820">One of the things my daughter said, she watched
my son one day have a fight with his best</p>
<p t="4040119" d="1000">friend.</p>
<p t="4041119" d="2011">It was a physical fight, you know.</p>
<p t="4043130" d="3180">His best friend did something that my best
friend didn't regard as appropriate and</p>
<p t="4046310" d="2779">so he hit him, and then there was a fight.</p>
<p t="4049089" d="3160">And then three days later they were friends
again.</p>
<p t="4052249" d="5320">And my daughter said to me that she was very
annoyed by that, which wasn't the fight</p>
<p t="4057569" d="3470">exactly, but the fact that they could have
a fight and then they were friends again three</p>
<p t="4061039" d="5341">days later, because she said that that option
wasn't available to women, right?</p>
<p t="4066380" d="4020">And the option is, the option that the men
have is, “well if you get out of hand I'll</p>
<p t="4070400" d="6129">just sock you one”, and then we'll have
established where the boundaries of behaviour</p>
<p t="4076529" d="1000">begin and end.</p>
<p t="4077529" d="6300">And I would say that in my experience, if
I'm talking to someone who's self-confident</p>
<p t="4083829" d="5030">and masculine and accomplished, there's
always an undercurrent of potential violence.</p>
<p t="4088859" d="2010">It's an undercurrent.</p>
<p t="4090869" d="3261">And that's actually an undercurrent of respect,
which means that there's things that we</p>
<p t="4094130" d="4390">can do to each other in a civilised way, but
there are rules that if you break, all hell's</p>
<p t="4098520" d="1210">going to break loose.</p>
<p t="4099730" d="4440">And one of the consequences of that is that
it doesn't.</p>
<p t="4104170" d="6060">Now the typical bullying pattern for women
in high school and junior high is reputation</p>
<p t="4110230" d="1740">destruction.</p>
<p t="4111970" d="8309">And I'm wondering, what are the implications
for the conduct of behaviour if there is no</p>
<p t="4120279" d="3121">recourse to aggression to solve disputes?</p>
<p t="4123400" d="3200">Because they don't get solved.</p>
<p t="4126600" d="5230">You know, I've tried to analyse what it
means to say ‘no' to someone, because</p>
<p t="4131830" d="1000">‘no' means something.</p>
<p t="4132830" d="5290">‘No' means… well if you tell a child
‘no', what you're basically telling</p>
<p t="4138120" d="3849">the child, as far as I can tell, is if you
continue doing that something you won't</p>
<p t="4141969" d="2051">like will happen to you.</p>
<p t="4144020" d="5110">And if you're civilised and say no what
happens is you say no a couple of times and</p>
<p t="4149130" d="4779">then instead of devaluing the word, which
is what you do if you just said it over and</p>
<p t="4153909" d="5281">over a hundred times with no consequences,
you take action that's non-verbal.</p>
<p t="4159190" d="4129">And so one of the things you might do is remove
the child from the situation, or you might</p>
<p t="4163319" d="1000">put them on the steps.</p>
<p t="4164319" d="3250">Or maybe you put them on the steps and they
run away, so you have to hold them on the</p>
<p t="4167569" d="1000">steps.</p>
<p t="4168569" d="5290">But the point is, the point to the child is,
there are limits, and if you exceed them,</p>
<p t="4173859" d="2900">you will be physically controlled.</p>
<p t="4176759" d="3790">What if there's no option for physical control?</p>
<p t="4180549" d="1000">What happens?</p>
<p t="4181549" d="4500">Well I don't know the answer to that, I
don't know what women do about that but</p>
<p t="4186049" d="3670">I also don't know what men do about that
in relationship to women.</p>
<p t="4189719" d="3091">So I was watching something the other day,
it was this…</p>
<p t="4192810" d="7090">I posted it on my Twitter account as an example
of animus possession.</p>
<p t="4199900" d="3500">So a woman and a man were having a dispute
on the street.</p>
<p t="4203400" d="1000">It was a political dispute.</p>
<p t="4204400" d="5710">And this particular woman, the way she was
behaving towards this particular man, was</p>
<p t="4210110" d="5350">such that had she been a man, and had he been
a man, he would have definitely hit her.</p>
<p t="4215460" d="4279">Because she was right in his face, and she
was cursing at him and swearing and calling</p>
<p t="4219739" d="1000">him an idiot.</p>
<p t="4220739" d="1000">And really being hyper-aggressive.</p>
<p t="4221739" d="2661">And of course, he couldn't do anything about
it.</p>
<p t="4224400" d="3710">So then I was watching that and I was thinking,
just exactly what are you supposed to do in</p>
<p t="4228110" d="1239">a situation like that?</p>
<p t="4229349" d="2151">Because you're screwed no matter what you
do.</p>
<p t="4231500" d="4760">If you're on the male side, it's like,
you certainly can't intervene physically.</p>
<p t="4236260" d="4979">It's like you're dead in the water instantly,
instantly, in your eyes, the eyes of society,</p>
<p t="4241239" d="3411">and in the woman's eyes, instantly, if you
move past the boundary.</p>
<p t="4244650" d="5719">If you leave, well, there's no glory in
running away, that's for sure.</p>
<p t="4250369" d="3401">So what exactly is supposed to happen?</p>
<p t="4253770" d="4000">I have no idea what's supposed to happen
in a situation like that.</p>
<p t="4257770" d="3719">I think what happens, what will happen over
time, is that men just won't put themselves</p>
<p t="4261489" d="1000">in those situations.</p>
<p t="4262489" d="6541">I think what the male would have to do in
that situation is behave like a woman would,</p>
<p t="4269030" d="6569">in a female dominance hierarchy.</p>
<p t="4275599" d="4401">So he stands there and takes it and afterwards
goes off and bad-mouths her to her social</p>
<p t="4280000" d="1000">circle.</p>
<p t="4281000" d="1000">That's a form of aggression.</p>
<p t="4282000" d="6020">Right, right, but you know that's definitely
not seen as an admirable form of behaviour</p>
<p t="4288020" d="1750">among men.</p>
<p t="4289770" d="2630">I mean, I don't think it's an admirable
form of behaviour, period.</p>
<p t="4292400" d="2864">But I mean, you know, aggression is often
not admirable, so that's fine.</p>
<p t="4295264" d="1000">Yeah?</p>
<p t="4296264" d="1000">I think that when you take away emotion, like
when someone's acting really aggressively</p>
<p t="4297264" d="4395">towards you and you reserve your emotion,
it gives them a lot less to feed off of, and</p>
<p t="4301659" d="13341">that ends up taking power away in a similar
way that aggression does.</p>
<p t="4315000" d="4280">Because people react aggressively and they
want feedback that gives them more excitement…</p>
<p t="4319280" d="1000">Oh definitely.</p>
<p t="4320280" d="2390">Oh yeah it would've been a real victory
for her if she would've gotten slapped.</p>
<p t="4322670" d="4130">Absolutely, because it would prove everything
she said instantly.</p>
<p t="4326800" d="5040">Yeah, but when you dismiss, power's gone.</p>
<p t="4331840" d="1580">So then you have all the power.</p>
<p t="4333420" d="1000">Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p t="4334420" d="5080">Well I think that that would be a reasonably
effective strategy for a street confrontation</p>
<p t="4339500" d="1000">like that.</p>
<p t="4340500" d="5320">I'm not so sure how well it would work in
a prolonged competition inside a company,</p>
<p t="4345820" d="1100">for example.</p>
<p t="4346920" d="7340">In a hierarchy, yeah, because you know the
truth of the matter is that men have no idea</p>
<p t="4354260" d="2189">how to treat women if they're in male power
hierarchies.</p>
<p t="4356449" d="2770">They have no idea how to treat them.</p>
<p t="4359219" d="1960">And that's because we have no idea how to
do that.</p>
<p t="4361179" d="1571">No one has any idea how to do that.</p>
<p t="4362750" d="10110">It's only been happening, in any pronounced
sense, for about, well, on a societal level,</p>
<p t="4372860" d="1540">really probably since the mid-70s.</p>
<p t="4374400" d="1900">You know, it's three generations.</p>
<p t="4376300" d="2279">It's a drop in the bucket.</p>
<p t="4378579" d="2931">And it's a very, very difficult thing to
sort out.</p>
<p t="4381510" d="3851">So, I mean part of the reason I've been
thinking about these sorts of things is because</p>
<p t="4385361" d="5059">I've been very interested in the fact that
men have been doing very badly in junior high</p>
<p t="4390420" d="3199">and high school, and they're bailing out
of universities like mad.</p>
<p t="4393619" d="4281">At the rate it's going there'll be almost
no men in most disciplines within ten years.</p>
<p t="4397900" d="3089">I mean you can tell that even in this class.</p>
<p t="4400989" d="5690">It's funny because on my YouTube videos
I look at the gender distribution for viewing</p>
<p t="4406679" d="3931">and it's 80% male, which is interesting
to me.</p>
<p t="4410610" d="2310">I'm not sure exactly why that is.</p>
<p t="4412920" d="6900">But in lots of fields it's 80:20 women already,
and I can't see why that won't…</p>
<p t="4419820" d="4660">I think that'll accelerate as we move forward,
rather than slowing down.</p>
<p t="4424480" d="8300">Alright, so anyways, back to sexual selection
and the power hierarchy.</p>
<p t="4432780" d="8580">Now from a Darwinian perspective, one of the
things you might do is call whatever selects</p>
<p t="4441360" d="2839">‘nature'.</p>
<p t="4444199" d="4821">And so when we think of nature and we think
about nature from a scientific perspective,</p>
<p t="4449020" d="4699">we don't even think about humans as agents
of nature, right?</p>
<p t="4453719" d="3471">We tend to think of the human being as something
that stands against nature.</p>
<p t="4457190" d="1199">That's in mythology.</p>
<p t="4458389" d="5761">It's like, the human being against the natural
world, it's a very common plot in movies</p>
<p t="4464150" d="1569">and stories.</p>
<p t="4465719" d="3071">So it's man against nature, roughly speaking.</p>
<p t="4468790" d="4449">So we tend to think of those as separate categories.</p>
<p t="4473239" d="9391">But if women do the selection among human
beings, at least they do the intense selection,</p>
<p t="4482630" d="3739">then women are nature, for men.</p>
<p t="4486369" d="2161">And that's exactly what the archetype is.</p>
<p t="4488530" d="1880">It's Mother Nature.</p>
<p t="4490410" d="5749">And Mother Nature has a very vicious element,
and the vicious element of Mother Nature is</p>
<p t="4496159" d="1351">rejection.</p>
<p t="4497510" d="3890">And that can be maternal rejection, which
is, you know, certainly something that causes</p>
<p t="4501400" d="1940">a tremendous amount of trauma.</p>
<p t="4503340" d="8210">But it can also be the most fundamental form
of rejection, and the most fundamental form</p>
<p t="4511550" d="2740">of rejection is sexual rejection.</p>
<p t="4514290" d="8950">Because it means that you are judged as biologically
unworthy, roughly speaking.</p>
<p t="4523240" d="3950">And there's other reasons why… so the
reason I'm telling you this is because I've</p>
<p t="4527190" d="5710">been trying to puzzle out… what you see
in mythology quite clearly is that the dominance</p>
<p t="4532900" d="3860">hierarchy is represented as male, so culture
is male, and nature is female.</p>
<p t="4536760" d="1890">Well, why the hell would nature be female?</p>
<p t="4538650" d="3610">It's like, okay, well I've given you one
reason, and I think it's the primary reason.</p>
<p t="4542260" d="5950">There's other reasons, because nature is
also seen as that which produces natural forms,</p>
<p t="4548210" d="5820">and of course, women produce natural forms,
so that's a logical association.</p>
<p t="4554030" d="5040">And then, what's the other one?</p>
<p t="4559070" d="9180">Well, we can leave it at that for the time
being.</p>
<p t="4568250" d="14929">So, now let me show you how </p>
<p t="4583179" d="1741">I think that that's represented.</p>
<p t="4584920" d="4940">I think this is the way the world is structured
when you consider it as a place of action.</p>
<p t="4589860" d="5560">So the world as a place of action has characters,
like the elements are characters, and the</p>
<p t="4595420" d="6259">characters are engaged in dramatic behaviour.</p>
<p t="4601679" d="6040">And there are classes of characters, and as
far as I can tell, this is a reasonably comprehensive</p>
<p t="4607719" d="2071">classification of dramatic characters.</p>
<p t="4609790" d="4630">We'll start from the inside and go out.</p>
<p t="4614420" d="3730">And you can think of any of these as primary,
by the way, and you'll see that reflected</p>
<p t="4618150" d="1410">in different kinds of mythology.</p>
<p t="4619560" d="5470">So sometimes the maternal is primary, and
sometimes the culture is primary, and sometimes</p>
<p t="4625030" d="2060">the hero, the individual is primary.</p>
<p t="4627090" d="5460">And I think that's because these three things
are irreducibly primary.</p>
<p t="4632550" d="5310">In that, from the perspective of consciousness,
in that, to be conscious, there has to be</p>
<p t="4637860" d="5200">you, but if you're conscious you have to
have evolved within a culture and that's</p>
<p t="4643060" d="5460">culture is necessarily nested in the natural
world, and so wherever there's one there's</p>
<p t="4648520" d="1380">all three.</p>
<p t="4649900" d="4390">And the individual's also the thing… without
the individual there wouldn't be any separation</p>
<p t="4654290" d="1420">between nature and culture.</p>
<p t="4655710" d="4270">So you can see the individual consciousness
is the generator of the entire structure,</p>
<p t="4659980" d="2330">but you can say that about any of the characters.</p>
<p t="4662310" d="6500">So there's the archetypal son, because the
hero tends to be masculine, and then, it has</p>
<p t="4668810" d="4639">a… that character has a positive element
and a negative element.</p>
<p t="4673449" d="6221">And the positive element is the good person,
and the negative element is the bad person.</p>
<p t="4679670" d="6900">And I would say the archetypal representations
of those are, like, the saviour, and Satan.</p>
<p t="4686570" d="5859">And that's basically… there are portrayals
like that in virtually every system of mythology</p>
<p t="4692429" d="1000">and religion.</p>
<p t="4693429" d="4521">Now it seems to me that in some sense Christianity,
and this was probably under the influence</p>
<p t="4697950" d="9410">of the Zoroastrians, developed the most articulated
representation of good vs. evil at the individual</p>
<p t="4707360" d="2460">level.</p>
<p t="4709820" d="5899">And that's why you can identify two fundamental
characters in the Christian story, so to speak,</p>
<p t="4715719" d="1041">that play out these roles.</p>
<p t="4716760" d="4890">And they're seen as eternal adversaries
locked in battle across time.</p>
<p t="4721650" d="3630">And that would be, the battle takes place
in the natural world, the battle takes place</p>
<p t="4725280" d="5280">in the cultural world, and the battle takes
place within, as well.</p>
<p t="4730560" d="3531">And you can see that reflected in stories
all the time, because, you know, it's so</p>
<p t="4734091" d="6209">frequently the case that the hero, the super-hero
has his nemesis.</p>
<p t="4740300" d="5439">And it's the guy that he's extraordinarily
well-matched with who continuously tests his</p>
<p t="4745739" d="3701">wits and whose motivation is essentially destructive.</p>
<p t="4749440" d="3900">So you see that with Batman and the Joker,
for example, or you see that with Sherlock</p>
<p t="4753340" d="2629">Holmes and Moriarty.</p>
<p t="4755969" d="7241">There's always this pairing and that's
partly because I think the archetypal realms</p>
<p t="4763210" d="4510">of human decision-making are something like,
are you working to make things better or are</p>
<p t="4767720" d="1600">you working to make things worse?</p>
<p t="4769320" d="4299">Are you possessed by resentment and hatred,
so that you want things to degenerate and</p>
<p t="4773619" d="6971">burn, or are you hopeful and capable of manifesting
faith in the future so that you're working</p>
<p t="4780590" d="1540">to make things better?</p>
<p t="4782130" d="4670">And then there's a battle in everyone, in
their own psyches, and then there's a battle</p>
<p t="4786800" d="1000">in culture.</p>
<p t="4787800" d="3720">There's a battle everywhere between those
two fundamental perspectives.</p>
<p t="4791520" d="5909">And then the archetypal son is the son of
the Great Father, and the Great Father represents</p>
<p t="4797429" d="2750">two things, order and tyranny.</p>
<p t="4800179" d="5810">So there's the hero and the adversary, at
the individual level, and at the social level</p>
<p t="4805989" d="1601">there's order and tyranny.</p>
<p t="4807590" d="5560">And so, roughly speaking, that's either
the wise king or the despot.</p>
<p t="4813150" d="3870">And the despot is someone who tries to eat
his own sons, which is actually a fairly common</p>
<p t="4817020" d="1770">mythological trope.</p>
<p t="4818790" d="4750">And you know, you're under the thumb of
the despot when you're not allowed, really,</p>
<p t="4823540" d="2520">either to be hero or adversary.</p>
<p t="4826060" d="6730">You're just a cog in the structure of the
social world.</p>
<p t="4832790" d="1490">So that's despotism.</p>
<p t="4834280" d="6089">On the orderly side, well, culture is what
we're sitting in right now.</p>
<p t="4840369" d="3310">I mean, this is social order that encapsulates
us.</p>
<p t="4843679" d="1081">Everything about it is social order.</p>
<p t="4844760" d="5959">I mean, there are rows, they're roughly
linear, you know everyone's in their place,</p>
<p t="4850719" d="5541">everyone knows what to do, we're unbelievably
protected from virtually anything you could</p>
<p t="4856260" d="1939">possibly imagine.</p>
<p t="4858199" d="5591">And so you know, we're in our father's
living room, so to speak.</p>
<p t="4863790" d="7340">And in that living room, it's a safe space…
oh God I should never have said that… [laughter]</p>
<p t="4871130" d="6150">anyways, it's a well-protected space in
which people are able to play and explore.</p>
<p t="4877280" d="7220">And it seems to me that one of the functions
that fathers play in a family, if they're</p>
<p t="4884500" d="3720">fulfilling their function properly, is that
what they do is they put a perimeter around</p>
<p t="4888220" d="5330">the territory, so that inside the walls, so
to speak, it's safe, and inside the safe</p>
<p t="4893550" d="1980">walls the children can play and explore.</p>
<p t="4895530" d="3370">And in their playing and exploring they develop
their own individuality.</p>
<p t="4898900" d="4190">And so, you know, you keep the darkness at
bay, and you can certainly see that that's</p>
<p t="4903090" d="3720">what the children want, because as soon as
you put them in a dark room, the first thing</p>
<p t="4906810" d="5680">they say is, you know, come chase the monsters
away out from underneath the bed.</p>
<p t="4912490" d="4370">And you know they wouldn't be thinking that
if they hadn't had an extraordinarily long</p>
<p t="4916860" d="4779">evolutionary history of being chased by monsters
in the dark.</p>
<p t="4921639" d="3991">And there are monsters in the dark, and everyone
knows that.</p>
<p t="4925630" d="6140">Which is why you tell your children not to
go play at night after it's dark, even now.</p>
<p t="4931770" d="5420">So order and tyranny are the representations
of culture.</p>
<p t="4937190" d="4190">And the thing is that there's a constant
interplay between those two because you can</p>
<p t="4941380" d="5210">never tell exactly when order has gone too
far and become tyranny.</p>
<p t="4946590" d="6089">Andy you can never tell really when there's
so little order that, well the next thing</p>
<p t="4952679" d="3031">happens which is the emergence of chaos.</p>
<p t="4955710" d="2160">And chaos is the Great Mother.</p>
<p t="4957870" d="1990">And it's creative and destructive.</p>
<p t="4959860" d="5080">And that's nature itself.</p>
<p t="4964940" d="3239">And then on the outside, the very outside,
and this is the most complicated category</p>
<p t="4968179" d="5261">of all, is that, it's the dragon of chaos,
and it represents something that's very</p>
<p t="4973440" d="1000">difficult to conceptualise.</p>
<p t="4974440" d="8739">But it's the un-configured substructure
of being that gives rise to these other categories.</p>
<p t="4983179" d="6210">So Donald Rumsfeld at one point made a very
famous comment, it became famous because it</p>
<p t="4989389" d="1221">fits an archetypal structure.</p>
<p t="4990610" d="3830">He said that there are known unknowns and
unknown unknowns.</p>
<p t="4994440" d="4279">Okay, the dragon of chaos is the unknown unknown.</p>
<p t="4998719" d="4591">It's so unknown that you don't even know
it's there, but it can raise its head at</p>
<p t="5003310" d="1020">any given point.</p>
<p t="5004330" d="3530">It's the thing that leaps out of you in
the darkness.</p>
<p t="5007860" d="3000">It's like, is it Zika, is that the new virus?</p>
<p t="5010860" d="1850">It's like the Zika virus.</p>
<p t="5012710" d="1710">It's like, no one saw it coming.</p>
<p t="5014420" d="3650">It's a completely new manifestation of being.</p>
<p t="5018070" d="6740">And so, known unknowns you can make plans
to circumvent, unknown unknowns, they're</p>
<p t="5024810" d="1000">completely unpredictable.</p>
<p t="5025810" d="4380">And what's so interesting, this is where
it's so bloody complicated, because you</p>
<p t="5030190" d="9460">really have to think about things differently
to grasp what this means.</p>
<p t="5039650" d="3670">This is part of the reason why I had trouble
with this section of the course on alchemy,</p>
<p t="5043320" d="5980">because it's so complicated that it's…
okay, so here, think of it this way.</p>
<p t="5049300" d="2230">What is the unknown made of?</p>
<p t="5051530" d="3770">That's a pretty weird question.</p>
<p t="5055300" d="3150">So I'll try to walk you through it, and
we won't get very far with this, because</p>
<p t="5058450" d="5140">we'll have to do it 15 or 20 times I think
before it starts to become something that</p>
<p t="5063590" d="1629">you can grapple with.</p>
<p t="5065219" d="5621">Alright, so it's September 11, 2011 and
the Twin Towers have just fallen.</p>
<p t="5070840" d="4040">Sorry, 2001, yes, 9/11.</p>
<p t="5074880" d="3029">Alright, what's emerged?</p>
<p t="5077909" d="2020">What's happened?</p>
<p t="5079929" d="6911">Well, one answer to that is that the towers
fell, but it's a very, very poor answer.</p>
<p t="5086840" d="6029">Because that was an unknown unknown, I would
say, and it traumatised people.</p>
<p t="5092869" d="3771">I mean everyone, even in Toronto, walked around
in shock for about two days after that.</p>
<p t="5096640" d="3770">And the reason for that was that we didn't
know what fell.</p>
<p t="5100410" d="4419">The buildings fell, but the thing is the buildings
aren't isolated.</p>
<p t="5104829" d="4312">Like, they're not some abandoned buildings
standing out there in the middle of a field</p>
<p t="5109141" d="4169">in a barren wasteland in the middle of an
abandoned country.</p>
<p t="5113310" d="1780">They weren't buildings, exactly.</p>
<p t="5115090" d="2730">They were only buildings at a superficial
level.</p>
<p t="5117820" d="5620">First of all they had 5000 people in them,
or 5000 people died, if I remember correctly.</p>
<p t="5123440" d="5310">And then all those people were networked out
with all sorts of other people.</p>
<p t="5128750" d="1590">And they were networked at multiple levels.</p>
<p t="5130340" d="5560">So they were family members but they were
also elements of the financial and economic</p>
<p t="5135900" d="1000">machine.</p>
<p t="5136900" d="3400">And in the political machine.</p>
<p t="5140300" d="5830">And then what was hit was of course, not just
the buildings, but the economic and political</p>
<p t="5146130" d="2390">system, whatever that means.</p>
<p t="5148520" d="5809">And of course the people who took the towers
down weren't trying to knock buildings down,</p>
<p t="5154329" d="5310">which is what you saw happen, they were trying
to knock down the things the buildings invisibly</p>
<p t="5159639" d="1540">related to.</p>
<p t="5161179" d="3681">And then you might ask well, what were those
buildings invisibly related to?</p>
<p t="5164860" d="3790">And it's a simpler question to actually
reverse the question and ask, well what weren't</p>
<p t="5168650" d="1660">they related to?</p>
<p t="5170310" d="4309">And the reason that people were traumatised
in the aftermath was because when we, when</p>
<p t="5174619" d="7191">our bodies, in some sense, answered that question,
the answer was, uh oh, those buildings were</p>
<p t="5181810" d="3869">probably attached to everything in every possible
way.</p>
<p t="5185679" d="4131">And so God only knows what's going to come
leaping out of that.</p>
<p t="5189810" d="7230">So what happens when you see the buildings
fall, the facts that you see the buildings</p>
<p t="5197040" d="2730">fall actually blinds you to what's happening.</p>
<p t="5199770" d="3920">It's a very peripheral representation of
the actual event.</p>
<p t="5203690" d="4340">Because you could also say, well it was a
psychological event, you know, it echoed inside</p>
<p t="5208030" d="1000">of you.</p>
<p t="5209030" d="3200">Well, you don't see that, you feel it, and
you don't really know what it means.</p>
<p t="5212230" d="6010">But it puts a wave of uncertainty, a radical
wave of uncertainty, into everything.</p>
<p t="5218240" d="3030">And not only the present, but also the future
for sure.</p>
<p t="5221270" d="3860">Because things took a vicious turn after that,
and almost immediately, right?</p>
<p t="5225130" d="4830">The whole political system readjusted itself,
it became much more authoritarian.</p>
<p t="5229960" d="2560">You know, airports became little fascist enclaves.</p>
<p t="5232520" d="4040">You know for me, for many people, I could
hardly go into an airport.</p>
<p t="5236560" d="7290">It just drove me crazy to be lined up like
that and then subject to search, you know,</p>
<p t="5243850" d="6150">by faceless representations of the paranoid
state.</p>
<p t="5250000" d="3050">God, that's a horrible thing to have to
encounter.</p>
<p t="5253050" d="3500">It's a bloody horrible thing to train people
to get accustomed to.</p>
<p t="5256550" d="2779">It's really dangerous to train people to
accept that sort of thing.</p>
<p t="5259329" d="5350">It was a way worse consequence I think, than
the buildings falling down themselves.</p>
<p t="5264679" d="2201">But that was one thing that happened.</p>
<p t="5266880" d="1000">What else happened?</p>
<p t="5267880" d="7640">Well the one trillion dollar surplus that
was projected by the Clintons at the end of</p>
<p t="5275520" d="4990">Bill Clinton's presidency, which was the
prediction for the next ten years, that the</p>
<p t="5280510" d="7270">economy was doing so well that the US government
was going to have a one trillion surplus over</p>
<p t="5287780" d="4890">the next ten years, turned into a four trillion
dollar deficit.</p>
<p t="5292670" d="2230">So that happened.</p>
<p t="5294900" d="5521">Well and then we got tangled up even worse
in the Middle East, and of course that, I</p>
<p t="5300421" d="3028">think that's probably got worse as time's
gone on rather than better.</p>
<p t="5303449" d="2671">And we have no idea where that's going to
end.</p>
<p t="5306120" d="4059">You know, I mean Russia's involved now,
and Russia rattled nuclear weapons at Turkey</p>
<p t="5310179" d="1000">the other day.</p>
<p t="5311179" d="4911">You know, even though Turkey's their largest
trading partner and a member of NATO.</p>
<p t="5316090" d="4320">And then you know, a million refugees flooded
into Europe, and God only knows what's going</p>
<p t="5320410" d="3120">to happen as a consequence of that.</p>
<p t="5323530" d="3379">And it's not like the people who planned
the bomb didn't know that, like here's</p>
<p t="5326909" d="1171">what they thought.</p>
<p t="5328080" d="5409">They thought “oh, the Soviet Union, that
was the second greatest power on Earth, and</p>
<p t="5333489" d="2391">then they waded into Afghanistan.</p>
<p t="5335880" d="2350">And they got tangled up in a terrorist war
and oh, poof!</p>
<p t="5338230" d="2540">Ten years later they didn't exist.</p>
<p t="5340770" d="2270">Maybe we could do the same thing to the United
States”.</p>
<p t="5343040" d="3400">It's like, well, who knows?</p>
<p t="5346440" d="1449">Maybe you could.</p>
<p t="5347889" d="7301">I mean they certainly… the response to the
9/11 disaster, in my opinion, was much more</p>
<p t="5355190" d="2080">expensive than the disaster itself.</p>
<p t="5357270" d="7490">I mean, one of the things that's quite horrifying
is that here's one statistic: nobody flew</p>
<p t="5364760" d="2670">in the aftermath of 9/11 for a while.</p>
<p t="5367430" d="4420">Like airplane flight bookings were way down.</p>
<p t="5371850" d="4850">More people died in car accidents (because
of not flying) than were killed in the bombings.</p>
<p t="5376700" d="3790">And no one ever noticed that, because people
are being killed on the highway all the time,</p>
<p t="5380490" d="1000">right?</p>
<p t="5381490" d="1689">I mean it's background noise as far as we're
concerned.</p>
<p t="5383179" d="6161">But you know, it's a really good example
of how not only do you not know what the event</p>
<p t="5389340" d="3960">is, you can't even tell who the event killed.</p>
<p t="5393300" d="5299">And so it's your apprehension of that, when
it occurs, that paralyses you.</p>
<p t="5398599" d="2681">And so that's the dragon of chaos, roughly
speaking.</p>
<p t="5401280" d="1299">That's an unknown unknown.</p>
<p t="5402579" d="6140">It's like all of reality, all of the multiple
levels of reality that exist around you are</p>
<p t="5408719" d="4451">all of a sudden altered in an incomprehensible
manner.</p>
<p t="5413170" d="5220">And then you could say that well, what happened
was the alteration of that reality.</p>
<p t="5418390" d="1579">This is what happened.</p>
<p t="5419969" d="5860">It's that you can only perceive it, essentially,
as the explosion in the building and the consequent</p>
<p t="5425829" d="1000">collapse.</p>
<p t="5426829" d="3910">And so you might say that the Twin Towers
were brought down.</p>
<p t="5430739" d="5411">It's like that's such a low-resolution
representation of what happened that it barely</p>
<p t="5436150" d="4750">begins to describe that event.</p>
<p t="5440900" d="5900">And so it's that invisible background of
complex interrelationships, like a very, very</p>
<p t="5446800" d="2760">complex melody, that's always going on around
you.</p>
<p t="5449560" d="2100">And as long as it works you don't even notice
it.</p>
<p t="5451660" d="6260">What happens is that it manifests itself as
predictable and desirable order.</p>
<p t="5457920" d="4590">Which you can understand, and which is the
reason we have predictable and desirable order.</p>
<p t="5462510" d="4300">This room is configured so that you can walk
into it without being afraid.</p>
<p t="5466810" d="3710">And what that means is that it's a radically
simplified version of reality.</p>
<p t="5470520" d="5230">You know, and you can see that, I mean, it's
even got padded walls, and that's to stop</p>
<p t="5475750" d="2560">the sound bouncing so that it won't annoy
you.</p>
<p t="5478310" d="5240">You know I mean it's warm, it's comfortable,
it's sort of neutral so it fades into the</p>
<p t="5483550" d="1100">background.</p>
<p t="5484650" d="3100">Everyone here is civilised beyond belief.</p>
<p t="5487750" d="2969">You hear about the radical individualism of
the West…</p>
<p t="5490719" d="3801">I think of all the nonsense I've ever heard
that's got to be the most nonsensical, we're</p>
<p t="5494520" d="3460">so bloody obedient that it's insane.</p>
<p t="5497980" d="5239">If you go to Edmonton at 3 o'clock in the
morning and watch pedestrians, they will stop</p>
<p t="5503219" d="4511">at the ‘don't walk' light and wait until
it turns green [laughter].</p>
<p t="5507730" d="4580">Now the roads are wide and so they… but
it's still the case.</p>
<p t="5512310" d="1750">It's like, really??</p>
<p t="5514060" d="1820">You think you're an individual, really?</p>
<p t="5515880" d="3510">And I'm not complaining about it, I think
it's an amazing thing because you know we</p>
<p t="5519390" d="3720">can really zip cars through our cities because
people don't run out into the middle of</p>
<p t="5523110" d="4100">the streets and get killed, they stay where
they're supposed to so it's incredibly</p>
<p t="5527210" d="1070">efficient.</p>
<p t="5528280" d="6250">But we're so obedient and well-behaved that
it's beyond… if you think about us as</p>
<p t="5534530" d="4189">chimpanzees with clothes, you know, we're
doing pretty damn well.</p>
<p t="5538719" d="4190">And we set up our environments so that they're
so simplified that we never have to encounter</p>
<p t="5542909" d="9111">this multi-dimensional layered reality of
patterns that's just moving around us all</p>
<p t="5552020" d="2110">the time and that actually makes up reality.</p>
<p t="5554130" d="3819">That's reality, that's what the world
is made out of.</p>
<p t="5557949" d="3951">That's a way different way of thinking about
it than to think of the world as made up of,</p>
<p t="5561900" d="1020">say, of atoms.</p>
<p t="5562920" d="6179">Because you think, that way you just think,
well it's marbles in space, you know.</p>
<p t="5569099" d="4261">And of course atoms aren't marbles, and
everyone knows that, like God only knows what</p>
<p t="5573360" d="1000">they are.</p>
<p t="5574360" d="2780">But that's still the image, that's still
the metaphor, of reality.</p>
<p t="5577140" d="1840">But that's not what reality is.</p>
<p t="5578980" d="8449">It's an insanely patterned orchestra of
phenomena and that's really what it is and</p>
<p t="5587429" d="5121">then what happens is that you're in this
little orderly sub-compartment in the middle.</p>
<p t="5592550" d="2419">It's like, you're in a box and the box
is in a box.</p>
<p t="5594969" d="1051">Well, let's think about it.</p>
<p t="5596020" d="4320">You're in a box, okay, this box is in a
building, that's a box.</p>
<p t="5600340" d="2299">The building is in the university, that's
a box.</p>
<p t="5602639" d="2201">The university is in the city, that's a
box.</p>
<p t="5604840" d="2950">The city is in the province, that's a box.</p>
<p t="5607790" d="4619">Then it's in Canada, then it's covered
by the American nuclear umbrella, you know,</p>
<p t="5612409" d="4801">and then it's embedded in this immense history
of individual rights and freedoms that have</p>
<p t="5617210" d="3989">manifested themselves as part of the political
and economic order.</p>
<p t="5621199" d="5020">And all of that's going on around you and
people are working like mad, crazily, to keep</p>
<p t="5626219" d="5831">all of those boxes intact, and here you are
sitting and thinking, well, what you see around</p>
<p t="5632050" d="1000">you is reality.</p>
<p t="5633050" d="5640">It's like it is, yeah, but man, there's
a lot of people making this reality so simple</p>
<p t="5638690" d="2199">that you don't have to think about it.</p>
<p t="5640889" d="5951">You can come in here and think about ideas,
you know for like hours at a time, and you</p>
<p t="5646840" d="2200">don't get eaten by a crocodile.</p>
<p t="5649040" d="4440">It's really… and you know no one comes
running through here pillaging, which is of</p>
<p t="5653480" d="5010">course… the crocodile eating and the pillaging
were very, very common occurrences in our</p>
<p t="5658490" d="2180">evolutionary history.</p>
<p t="5660670" d="4380">For lots of our ancestors going down to get
water from the local river was a life or death</p>
<p t="5665050" d="1000">mission.</p>
<p t="5666050" d="5230">I mean I can't imagine having to get water
from a crocodile infested stream.</p>
<p t="5671280" d="4549">Especially when that's where the lions are
hanging out too, you know.</p>
<p t="5675829" d="1781">So, that's order.</p>
<p t="5677610" d="1779">That's the positive element of order.</p>
<p t="5679389" d="4111">Now you can say, students say this a lot:
“oh my God, I'm so constrained within</p>
<p t="5683500" d="3610">these boxes, it's destroying my individuality”
you know.</p>
<p t="5687110" d="1080">And that's the tyrannical…</p>
<p t="5688190" d="6799">I mean it's pathetic in some sense, because
God, you're so privileged it's beyond</p>
<p t="5694989" d="1101">comprehension.</p>
<p t="5696090" d="6379">But having said that, it is also the case,
and the case has to be made, that you do have</p>
<p t="5702469" d="4221">to sacrifice your potential to cultural norms.</p>
<p t="5706690" d="3920">And that is… you can argue that that's
destructive.</p>
<p t="5710610" d="1489">And sometimes it is destructive.</p>
<p t="5712099" d="3001">Like creative people don't fit very well
into nested boxes.</p>
<p t="5715100" d="4369">And in order for them to fit they have to
do damage in some sense to their psyches,</p>
<p t="5719469" d="8750">because they're not naturally made to…
that isn't their natural environment, boxes</p>
<p t="5728219" d="1361">within boxes.</p>
<p t="5729580" d="1740">And so they might say, well I'm being oppressed.</p>
<p t="5731320" d="2760">It's like, well of course you're being
oppressed.</p>
<p t="5734080" d="4539">If you're in fifty boxes that's constrain
your freedom of movement, but maybe you should</p>
<p t="5738619" d="3171">be somewhat grateful for the fact that the
boxes exist.</p>
<p t="5741790" d="1840">You think, well you don't even notice them.</p>
<p t="5743630" d="3790">The boxes are so effective that you don't
even notice them.</p>
<p t="5747420" d="4870">You can even criticise them, and you should,
you know, maybe they could be better and not</p>
<p t="5752290" d="2139">quite as rigid, and so forth.</p>
<p t="5754429" d="9351">And the criticism is justified but you have
to keep both of the representations in mind</p>
<p t="5763780" d="1820">at the same time, you know.</p>
<p t="5765600" d="2999">Your culture is the wise king and the despot
at the same time.</p>
<p t="5768599" d="7791">And people hate that sort of thing because…
and you know our rational minds and our history</p>
<p t="5776390" d="5789">of logical intellectual thinking has forced
us to assume that a thing can't be itself</p>
<p t="5782179" d="2440">and its opposite at the same time.</p>
<p t="5784619" d="5690">But unfortunately when you're talking about
very large-scale categories, things are what</p>
<p t="5790309" d="2491">they are and their opposite at the same time.</p>
<p t="5792800" d="5649">Because culture is the wise king and the tyrant,
and that means it's very difficult to adjust</p>
<p t="5798449" d="3701">your behaviour in relationship to it, because
you never know if you're talking to the</p>
<p t="5802150" d="1170">wise king or the tyrant.</p>
<p t="5803320" d="2610">You know, and you feel that.</p>
<p t="5805930" d="3330">If you have to do your taxes or if you have
to deal with the university bureaucracy in</p>
<p t="5809260" d="4569">some way, it's like, you're a number,
you know, and you're just annoying, like</p>
<p t="5813829" d="3671">patients in the hospital, because hospitals
would run a lot better if they didn't have</p>
<p t="5817500" d="1449">any patients in them, obviously.</p>
<p t="5818949" d="3651">And you know, you feel that, of course, whenever
you're in a very complex bureaucracy.</p>
<p t="5822600" d="3800">It's like, you're exchangeable, and that's
very annoying.</p>
<p t="5826400" d="2260">But by the same token, here you are.</p>
<p t="5828660" d="4939">So you have to criticise… this is also a
very complex form of moral behaviour.</p>
<p t="5833599" d="3330">You have to criticise with gratitude.</p>
<p t="5836929" d="5301">And that's something that students should
really be taught in university, because the</p>
<p t="5842230" d="5219">opposite of gratitude is resentment, and there
is nothing that's more pathological than</p>
<p t="5847449" d="1000">resentment.</p>
<p t="5848449" d="5421">The only thing that comes close to resentment,
in terms of its capacity to produce misery,</p>
<p t="5853870" d="5070">is arrogance, and those things are often…
arrogance, resentment, and deceit… it's</p>
<p t="5858940" d="1230">like that's the evil triad.</p>
<p t="5860170" d="4130">You get all those three things going in your
life and boy, you're going to be in rough</p>
<p t="5864300" d="3220">shape very, very rapidly.</p>
<p t="5867520" d="6199">So then, let's take a break, for fifteen
minutes, okay?</p>
