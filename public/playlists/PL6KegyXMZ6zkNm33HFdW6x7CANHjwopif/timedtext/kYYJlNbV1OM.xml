<p t="15140" d="5520">Well, you might as well start by writing down that URL.</p>
<p t="22000" d="2800">I'll show it to you again at the end of class.</p>
<p t="24820" d="1920">That's where the syllabus is.</p>
<p t="27680" d="4400">The syllabus will tell you pretty much everything you need to know about the class.</p>
<p t="33160" d="2420">The... there's a text.</p>
<p t="38240" d="1020">This is it.</p>
<p t="40020" d="2800">It consists of readings from a larger text.</p>
<p t="44120" d="8320">I use it because it's old, but a lot of the theorists that we are going to talk about are also old...</p>
<p t="52440" d="5200">....and so I found this particular text accurate.</p>
<p t="58380" d="5840">And many of the people that we're going to talk about are very...</p>
<p t="64220" d="4620">...have very sophisticated views of personality.</p>
<p t="69780" d="8600">And I think that it does you a disservice unless you read something that's sufficiently sophisticated.</p>
<p t="78900" d="7840">So that you actually understand, at least to some degree, what the people that we're going to study were talking about.</p>
<p t="89520" d="5040">We might as well start, I suppose, with a definition of personality.</p>
<p t="95660" d="4040">It's hard to define something that's that general because...</p>
<p t="101920" d="7800">When you're speaking about human beings, it's not that simple to figure out what constitutes personality and what constitutes something else.</p>
<p t="110560" d="9900">But... So I'm going to hit at it from a couple of different perspectives and while I'm doing so...</p>
<p t="120460" d="6940">...I would like you also to consider the nature of what you're going to learn.</p>
<p t="129760" d="3700">Human personality is, essentially, unfathomable.</p>
<p t="134780" d="5760">Human beings are unbelievable complicated and we're nested in systems that are also unbelievably complicated.</p>
<p t="141380" d="6520">There are more patterns of connections between neurons in your brain than there are subatomic particles in the universe.</p>
<p t="147900" d="2120">By a substantial margin.</p>
<p t="150060" d="4420">You can look up Gerald Edelman if you want to find out about that.</p>
<p t="154860" d="7380">And so it's not unreasonable to point out that you're the most complicated thing we know of by many orders of magnitude.</p>
<p t="162240" d="8860">And the probability that you can understand yourself and anything approaching totality is extraordinarily low.</p>
<p t="177280" d="10320">So this makes the study of personality something very daring and hopeless and complicated.</p>
<p t="189280" d="3600">Now, we're going to cycle through a very large number of theorists...</p>
<p t="193120" d="6000">...and what you'll find is that although there is commonalities between them, there are marked differences.</p>
<p t="200220" d="1940">And so then you might ask yourself...</p>
<p t="203080" d="660">Well...</p>
<p t="205580" d="1820">What's the point of studying...</p>
<p t="207900" d="2960">...this sequence of theorists and ideas if...</p>
<p t="210860" d="3000">...there's no point of agreement between them?</p>
<p t="215080" d="1600">And I would say first:</p>
<p t="216680" d="2560">There are points of agreement between them.</p>
<p t="219860" d="880">Although...</p>
<p t="221520" d="4040">Personality hasn't advanced to the point, where I would say that we have a...</p>
<p t="225560" d="3980">...homogeneous theory that's free of internal contradictions.</p>
<p t="231260" d="1800">But I would also say that...</p>
<p t="235400" d="2960">...personality is a hybrid discipline.</p>
<p t="240100" d="1680">It's partly science...</p>
<p t="242560" d="2240">...but it's partly engineering.</p>
<p t="246280" d="5860">The clinical element of it, I would say, is more like engineering, and what engineers do is try to do things.</p>
<p t="252140" d="4240">They try to make something happen. And they are informed by theory.</p>
<p t="256460" d="3340">But the point is still to build something.</p>
<p t="260780" d="5780">And when you're working as a clinical psychologist, and most of the initial theorists that we'll discuss, for the first...</p>
<p t="266560" d="3540">...little more than a third to a half of the course, are clinical theorists.</p>
<p t="271620" d="2100">They're trying to build something.</p>
<p t="273720" d="3640">And they're dealing with very very difficult...</p>
<p t="277360" d="2940">...conceptual problems, because...</p>
<p t="281560" d="5280">...they're either trying to cure mental disorders or maybe even unhappiness...</p>
<p t="286840" d="2160">...and trying to bring about health...</p>
<p t="289940" d="2400">And the problem with that is that...</p>
<p t="292740" d="4160">It's not a straightforward thing to define a mental disorder...</p>
<p t="296900" d="2100">...from a scientific perspective...</p>
<p t="299780" d="3860">...because what's healthy, mentally, and what's not...</p>
<p t="303640" d="3080">...is partly social judgment.</p>
<p t="307620" d="2720">...and it's partly socially constructed.</p>
<p t="310440" d="3000">And it partly has to do with norms...</p>
<p t="313440" d="4820">...and it partly has to do with ideals, because you might also say that...</p>
<p t="318260" d="2320">...to be healthy is to be normal.</p>
<p t="320640" d="3240">But you could also say that to be healthy is to be ideal.</p>
<p t="324100" d="5520">And then, of course, you run into the problem of having to conceptualize an ideal.</p>
<p t="330140" d="7720">And it isn't self-evident that science is capable of conceptualizing an ideal...</p>
<p t="337860" d="10780">...because ideals tend to fall into the domain of moral judgments, say, or philosophical judgments rather than scientific judgments per se.</p>
<p t="351100" d="2320">So what I would say to you is that...</p>
<p t="355100" d="7360">It would be worthwhile to approach this course as if you were an engineer of the human spirit.</p>
<p t="363780" d="3320">An engineer of your own spirit, to begin with...</p>
<p t="367100" d="4800">...but also an engineer of the spirits of other people...</p>
<p t="371900" d="3820">...because, as you interact with other people...</p>
<p t="375720" d="5180">...you inevitably tell them what you want and what you don't want.</p>
<p t="381580" d="4340">When they give you what you want and what you admire...</p>
<p t="385920" d="5900">...you respond positively to them, you pay attention to them, you smile at them, you focus...</p>
<p t="391820" d="3560">You focus your thoughts on them, you interact with them.</p>
<p t="395580" d="1840">And you reward them...</p>
<p t="397420" d="7540">...for acting in a particular manner, and when they don't respond the way that you want, then you punish them...</p>
<p t="404960" d="8220">...with a look or by turning away or by rejecting their friendship or, when you're a child, by refusing to play for them—play with them.</p>
<p t="413700" d="1080">And so...</p>
<p t="416000" d="5880">We're engaged in the co-creation of personalities, our own and others...</p>
<p t="421880" d="5280">...and that also brings up the same question:</p>
<p t="427160" d="7940">What is it that we are all collectively trying to be and trying to create?</p>
<p t="437380" d="5640">I suspect that you all have the experience of falling short of the ideal,</p>
<p t="443020" d="4980">...an ideal that you hold for yourself or an ideal that other people hold for you.</p>
<p t="448360" d="6320">I suspect that you all feel the negative consequences of falling short of that ideal.</p>
<p t="456600" d="8880">Freud would conceptualize that as the super-ego imposing its judgment on ego, you being the ego,</p>
<p t="465480" d="6360">...the super-ego being... a hybrid, I suppose, of...</p>
<p t="471840" d="9800">...external forces and also your internalization of those judgments and forces.</p>
<p t="484060" d="6600">Now, personality per se, I would say...</p>
<p t="490660" d="3820">...has these elements of ideal...</p>
<p t="494480" d="6240">...and has structural elements as well, and we're going to talk about those more in the second half of the class.</p>
<p t="501980" d="4840">The structural elements can be lined up and outlined more scientifically.</p>
<p t="507560" d="11240">The second half of the class concentrates more on physiology—brain physiology—and on statistical approaches to the description of personality.</p>
<p t="519120" d="4240">Um... I suppose you might say that that outlines the territory.</p>
<p t="525460" d="3900">The course is called Personality and Its Transformations, because...</p>
<p t="530740" d="8240">We have personalities—that's who you are now—but our personalities are also capable of transformation, of change.</p>
<p t="539100" d="3860">I mean, obviously we think about that as learning.</p>
<p t="543200" d="5600">Um... some of that might be regarded as factual learning...</p>
<p t="548800" d="6240">...and some of it might be regarded as learning how to perceive and behave.</p>
<p t="555500" d="8120">And I would say that the clinical psychologists that we'll cover, to begin with,</p>
<p t="563620" d="8320">...are much more concerned with the nature of the implicit structures that shape your perceptions,</p>
<p t="571940" d="6940">...and also the implicit structures that shape your behaviors and how they're...</p>
<p t="578880" d="6760">...integrated in relationship to your negative emotion health and well-being,</p>
<p t="585640" d="5540">...whereas the thinkers in the second half are more concerned about...</p>
<p t="591180" d="8360">...laying out the structural elements of those features and relating them to underlying, say, mechanistic phenomena,</p>
<p t="599540" d="9320">...making the assumption, which seems warranted, that there's some relationship between your personality and the manner in which your brain functions.</p>
<p t="609860" d="8900">I'm going to try to provide you with a meta-narrative that will help you to unite these different theories.</p>
<p t="619360" d="6340">I've often found it useful when I'm trying to remember something to have a story to hang the facts on,</p>
<p t="625700" d="4320">...otherwise you're faced with the necessity of doing nothing but memorization, and...</p>
<p t="630020" d="4040">...it isn't obvious to me that memorization actually constitutes knowledge.</p>
<p t="634420" d="620">Um...</p>
<p t="635440" d="7060">What constitutes knowledge is that generation of a cognitive structure that enables you to...</p>
<p t="642500" d="3860">...conduct yourself more appropriately in life.</p>
<p t="646720" d="3680">And so I suppose you might say that a course in psychology—</p>
<p t="650740" d="4000">You could argue that a course in psychology, especially in personality,</p>
<p t="654740" d="2800">...is a course in applied wisdom as well,</p>
<p t="657540" d="7220">...assuming that wisdom is, in part, your capacity to understand yourselves, so that you don't—</p>
<p t="664760" d="5060">—so that you don't present too much of an intolerable mystery to yourself,</p>
<p t="669820" d="4220">...and also to understand others so that you can...</p>
<p t="674040" d="2480">...predict their behavior,</p>
<p t="676520" d="2460">...understand their motivations,</p>
<p t="678980" d="1840">...negotiate with them,</p>
<p t="680820" d="2000">...listen to them,</p>
<p t="682820" d="3560">...and formulate joint games with them,</p>
<p t="686380" d="9660">...so that you can integrate yourself reasonably well with another person and with a family and in society.</p>
<p t="699140" d="8900">Well, the structural elements of personality might be regarded as the implicit structures that govern your perception,</p>
<p t="708040" d="3420">...and that tilt you towards certain kinds of behaviors.</p>
<p t="711460" d="5360">I can give you some examples—we can talk about the big five model just briefly.</p>
<p t="718260" d="5820">The big five personality model is a statistical model, which we'll cover in detail, trait by trait,</p>
<p t="725220" d="2540">...partly during the second half of the course.</p>
<p t="728480" d="3860">The way that the big five was generated was that...</p>
<p t="732340" d="3360">...its trait been generated over about fifty years...</p>
<p t="735700" d="10020">...that personality psychologists gathered together adjectives within the English language first that were used to describe human beings,</p>
<p t="745720" d="3480">...as many adjectives that they could collect,</p>
<p t="749200" d="3220">...and then subjected them to a process called factor analysis,</p>
<p t="752420" d="4660">...and what factor analysis does is enable you statistically to determine...</p>
<p t="757080" d="2840">...in some sense how similar adjectives are to one another.</p>
<p t="759920" d="1620">So, for example,</p>
<p t="761540" d="7880">...if you gave a thousand people a list of adjectives to describe themselves with,</p>
<p t="769420" d="4780">...and one of the adjectives was happy and another of the adjectives was social,</p>
<p t="774200" d="7240">...you'd find that those who rated themselves high on happy would also rate themselves high on social,</p>
<p t="781440" d="4940">...and those who rated themselves low on happy would also rate themselves low on social.</p>
<p t="786560" d="4260">And by looking at those patterns of co-variation, you can determine...</p>
<p t="790820" d="3960">...what the essential dimensions are of human personality.</p>
<p t="795100" d="5320">One of the dimensions is roughly happiness. That's extraversion.</p>
<p t="800880" d="5020">Another dimension is neuroticism. It's a negative emotion dimension.</p>
<p t="806180" d="6900">So,  if you ask someone if they're anxious, and they score high, say, on a scale of one to seven,</p>
<p t="813080" d="5020">...they're also likely to score high on another item that says that they're sad.</p>
<p t="818480" d="3360">And it turns out that negative emotions clump together.</p>
<p t="822020" d="6820">And so that people who experience more of one negative emotion have a propensity to experience more of all of them.</p>
<p t="829420" d="2900">There's another dimension called agreeableness.</p>
<p t="832920" d="5960">And agreeable people are self-sacrificing, compassionate, and polite.</p>
<p t="839420" d="5840">If you're dealing with an agreeable person—they don't like conflict, they care for other people.</p>
<p t="845800" d="6500">Um, if you're dealing with an agreeable person, they're likely to put your concerns ahead of theirs,</p>
<p t="852300" d="2820">...they're non-competitive and cooperative.</p>
<p t="855460" d="6960">Uh, it's a dimension where women are—women score more highly than men on agreeableness across cultures,</p>
<p t="862420" d="7560">...including those cultures where the largest steps have been taken towards producing an egalitarian social circumstance,</p>
<p t="869980" d="1500">...like Scandinavia actually.</p>
<p t="871720" d="3940">The gender differences in personality there are larger there than they are anywhere else.</p>
<p t="876260" d="680">Um...</p>
<p t="877480" d="2600">Another trait is conscientiousness.</p>
<p t="880560" d="3280">Conscientiousness is an excellent trait if you want to do well in...</p>
<p t="883840" d="4460">...in school, and in work, especially if you're a manager or an administrator.</p>
<p t="889320" d="3620">I can't say we understand a lot about conscientiousness, although it...</p>
<p t="892940" d="5040">...it reliably emerges from factor analytic studies of adjective groups across different countries.</p>
<p t="898340" d="3760">Conscientious people are diligent, industrious, and orderly.</p>
<p t="902380" d="3480">Their orderliness tilts them towards political conservatism, by the way,</p>
<p t="905860" d="4280">...because it turns out that your in-built temperament, your in-built personality,</p>
<p t="910140" d="4480">...which constitutes a set of filters through which you view the world...</p>
<p t="914620" d="4400">...also alters the manner in which you process information,</p>
<p t="919020" d="2760">...and influences the way that you vote.</p>
<p t="921780" d="3040">And so you might say, and I do believe that this is true,</p>
<p t="924820" d="2960">...our—we've been doing a lot of research on this as of late:</p>
<p t="930600" d="7160">The more accurate a measure you take of someone's political beliefs, the more you find that personality is what's predicting them.</p>
<p t="937760" d="4460">And I think that's a reasonable thing to think about, because, you know,</p>
<p t="942220" d="5360">You have to—you have to figure out ways of simplifying the world, right, because you just can't do everything.</p>
<p t="947980" d="1900">And so, people are specialized.</p>
<p t="949880" d="2420">They have specialized niches that they occupy.</p>
<p t="952300" d="1820">You could think about them as social niches.</p>
<p t="954120" d="4640">A niche is a place where your particular skills would serve to maintain you.</p>
<p t="958760" d="4360">And so if you're extraverted, you're going to look for a social niche,</p>
<p t="963120" d="1460">...because you like to be around people.</p>
<p t="964580" d="3000">And if you're introverted, you're going to spend much more time on your own.</p>
<p t="967580" d="2300">And so, if you're an introverted person, for example,</p>
<p t="969880" d="3900">...you're gonna want a job where you're not selling,</p>
<p t="973780" d="3640">...and where you're not surrounded by groups of people who are making social demands on you all the time,</p>
<p t="977420" d="1500">...because it will wear you out.</p>
<p t="979060" d="3200">Whereas if you're extraverted, that's just exactly what you want.</p>
<p t="982700" d="3980">And so the extravert sees the world as a place of social opportunity.</p>
<p t="987120" d="4740">And the introvert sees the world as a place to retreat from and spend time alone.</p>
<p t="992300" d="4940">And it turns out that both of those modes of being are valid,</p>
<p t="997240" d="4220">...that the issue, at least to some degree is whether or not you're fortunate enough...</p>
<p t="1001460" d="3520">...to match your temperament with the demands of the environment.</p>
<p t="1004980" d="8580">And I suppose also whether you're fortunough—fortunate enough—so that you're born in an era where there actually is a niche for your particular temperament.</p>
<p t="1013560" d="3380">Because it isn't necessarily the case that that will be the case.</p>
<p t="1017160" d="6740">Imagine that all of these temperamental dimensions vary because of evolutionary pressure, right?</p>
<p t="1023900" d="3240">So there's a distribution of extraversion, a normal distribution.</p>
<p t="1027140" d="5440">Most people are somewhere in the middle and then as you go out towards the extremes there are fewer and fewer people.</p>
<p t="1033080" d="5480">And what that means is that, on average across large spans of time,</p>
<p t="1038560" d="4980">...there have been environments that match every single position on that distribution,</p>
<p t="1043540" d="5320">...with most of the environments matching the center, because otherwise we wouldn't have evolved that way.</p>
<p t="1048860" d="6380">And so sometimes being really extraverted is going to work well for you in a minority of environments—a minority of niches,</p>
<p t="1055240" d="2340">...and sometimes it's just going to be a catastrophe.</p>
<p t="1057800" d="6900">I suspect, for example, that if you live in a tyrannical society, where any sign of...</p>
<p t="1064700" d="3000">...of... of... of...</p>
<p t="1067700" d="3280">...personally oriented activities likely to get you in trouble,</p>
<p t="1070980" d="5020">...that being extraverted and low in neuroticism wouldn't be a very good idea, because...</p>
<p t="1076000" d="5000">...you're going to be mouthy and happy and saying a lot of things, unable to keep your thoughts to yourself,</p>
<p t="1081000" d="1740">...and you're going to be relatively fearless.</p>
<p t="1082940" d="7440">Now, I don't know that for sure, because we haven't done the studies that precisely match temperamental proclivity to environmental demand,</p>
<p t="1090380" d="1620">...but you get what I mean.</p>
<p t="1092660" d="820">So...</p>
<p t="1094520" d="5760">Conscientious people, anyways—conscientious people are industrious and orderly.</p>
<p t="1100280" d="1980">We know a little bit about orderliness.</p>
<p t="1102480" d="4000">It seems to be associated, strangely enough, with disgust sensitivity,</p>
<p t="1106480" d="2520">...which I suppose isn't that surprising, you know.</p>
<p t="1109000" d="3680">You take an orderly person, and you put them in a messy kitchen,</p>
<p t="1112680" d="6500">...they respond with disgust and want nothing more than to straighten it all out and organize it and clean it</p>
<p t="1119180" d="2820">And there's tremendous variability in orderliness.</p>
<p t="1122240" d="600">Um...</p>
<p t="1123800" d="2640">And as I said, orderliness predicts political conservatism.</p>
<p t="1126440" d="2640">It's not the only thing, but it's certainly one of the things.</p>
<p t="1129740" d="620">Um...</p>
<p t="1133320" d="4740">The correlation between conscientiousness and grades is about 0.4.</p>
<p t="1138420" d="2260">That's about sixteen percent of the variance.</p>
<p t="1140860" d="4280">It's—it's the second best predictor of university grades after intelligence,</p>
<p t="1145140" d="2440">...and we'll talk about intelligence during this course, too.</p>
<p t="1148200" d="2860">Intelligence is actually a relatively straightforward concept.</p>
<p t="1151680" d="1840">I don't think I'll get into it today, but...</p>
<p t="1154000" d="5100">Conscientious people—they're industriousness and their orderliness makes them schedule their time,</p>
<p t="1159100" d="1880">...so they make efficient use of their time.</p>
<p t="1160980" d="1760">They use schedules and that sort of thing.</p>
<p t="1163000" d="5740">We haven't been able te figure out anything about the underlying biology or psychology of industriousness.</p>
<p t="1169040" d="4100">We've tried, really, dozens and dozens of tests,</p>
<p t="1173140" d="6700">...attempting to find a laboratory measure on which industrious people do better, and we failed completely.</p>
<p t="1180000" d="2460">And there's no animal models of industriousness, either.</p>
<p t="1182640" d="4480">And so, I would say it's a great mystery that remains at the heart of trait psychology.</p>
<p t="1187420" d="560">Um...</p>
<p t="1188260" d="3100">And maybe it's a human-specific category, you know, I mean,</p>
<p t="1191360" d="3240">...you could think of sled dogs maybe of being industrious, and maybe—</p>
<p t="1194600" d="5280">...and maybe sheep dogs and animals that work like that, but of course they've been trained by human beings, so...</p>
<p t="1199880" d="4860">...but, it isn't obvious that animals are industrious the same way we are.</p>
<p t="1204940" d="5920">I mean, industriousness involves sacrificing the present for the future. Something like that.</p>
<p t="1210860" d="6020">And it seems like you have to be able to conceptualize time in order to sacrifice the present for the future.</p>
<p t="1217600" d="6220">One of the things that I would  recommend that you do as students, um, in this course,</p>
<p t="1223820" d="3060">...and maybe in every course, speaking of industriousness, is:</p>
<p t="1227240" d="4200">Come up with a plan of attack for the course, and use a scheduler, you know.</p>
<p t="1231740" d="6740">If you treat your university career like a full-time job, you're much more likely to succeed, and,</p>
<p t="1238480" d="5400">...if you keep up on the readings, and you keep up on the—on the essays and all of that,</p>
<p t="1243880" d="6120">...then you're much less likely as well to fall into despair when you get too far behind...</p>
<p t="1250000" d="5780">...using a Google Calendar or something like that to organize a schedule for the entire semester...</p>
<p t="1255780" d="6640">...at the beginning of the semester can be invaluable, especially if you're not very industriousness—very industrious,</p>
<p t="1262420" d="1700">...because it can keep you on track,</p>
<p t="1264120" d="4560">...and one of the things we know about industrious people is that they are very good at using schedules,</p>
<p t="1268680" d="3000">...and at planning the use of their time,</p>
<p t="1271680" d="5320">...and so, I would like to say that you should all be smarter, but I don't know how you could be smarter.</p>
<p t="1277000" d="3080">We don't know anything about how to improve intelligence,</p>
<p t="1280080" d="4180">...and, I suppose we don't really know anything about how to improve industriousness, either,</p>
<p t="1284260" d="5080">...but I can tell you that people who are industrious come up with a strategy...</p>
<p t="1289340" d="5040">...for solving the problem that's ahead of them, and then they do whatever they can to stick to the strategy,</p>
<p t="1294380" d="5560">...and so, for example, if you sat down, today or tomorrow, for a couple of hours—</p>
<p t="1299940" d="4400">...three hours—and you filled in a Google Calendar—whatever you happen to use—</p>
<p t="1304340" d="6080">...with a strategy for studying, and a list of when all your assignments are due and all of that,</p>
<p t="1310420" d="2920">...and when you're going to sit down and study</p>
<p t="1313340" d="6300">then you won't be in the position where you have to crammed for ten hours a day, hopelessly, right before</p>
<p t="1319640" d="1380">...you know, important exam</p>
<p t="1321020" d="3180">...it's also very ineffective way of studying by the way</p>
<p t="1324200" d="6300">I mean, first of all people who cram for ten hours say they're studying for ten hours, but they rarely are because, well...</p>
<p t="1332260" d="1760">I can't study for ten hours</p>
<p t="1334020" d="4860">I don't have the power of concentration that would enable me to do that for that prolonged period of time</p>
<p t="1338880" d="5260">I can manage about three hours of intense intellectual activity before I'm pretty done</p>
<p t="1344740" d="6560">and it's also the case that if you study and than sleep and than study and then sleep, you space it out</p>
<p t="1351300" d="1520">then you much more likely to remember</p>
<p t="1353320" d="5220">It's also much more likely that you're much more likely to remember if you try to recall the material.</p>
<p t="1358540" d="3740">and so highlighting and that sort of thing isn't very useful</p>
<p t="1362280" d="7120">but reading, closing the book, summarising what you've read without opening the damn book, that's useful.</p>
<p t="1369440" d="3480">and the reason for that is that you're practising remembering.</p>
<p t="1373520" d="1320">and that's what you have to practise.</p>
<p t="1375120" d="3460">If you're practising memorisation, you have to practise remembering.</p>
<p t="1378700" d="7560">You don't just go over the thing over and over; that'll help you with recognition memory, some, but it won't help you with recall memory.</p>
<p t="1386500" d="2460">Anyways, the last trait is openness.</p>
<p t="1389400" d="5060">Openness is a creativity trait. It's also associated with intelligence, in that intelligent people</p>
<p t="1394580" d="2220">(and I'm speaking technically of IQ),</p>
<p t="1396880" d="5300">tend to be higher, tend to be more creative, which is hardly surprising,</p>
<p t="1402580" d="4220">Creative people are more likely to be liberal politically, by the way.</p>
<p t="1407620" d="4220">They like novelty, they like aesthetics, they like fiction,</p>
<p t="1411840" d="2880">they like movies, they like art, they like poetry.</p>
<p t="1414720" d="4780">There's something about them that grants them an aesthetic sensitivity.</p>
<p t="1420840" d="2320">And that's an inbuilt trait.</p>
<p t="1423980" d="4380">It's not the case, by the way, that everyone's creative. In fact, far from it.</p>
<p t="1428500" d="2560">We've used the Creative Achievement Questionnaire to--</p>
<p t="1431940" d="3240">--to measure people's creativity, and I'll talk to you about that later in the class.</p>
<p t="1435600" d="2000">And the Creative Achievement Questionnaire</p>
<p t="1437980" d="2000">takes thirteen dimensions of creativity --</p>
<p t="1440380" d="4600">so, you know, writing, dancing, acting, scientific investigation,</p>
<p t="1444980" d="3440">entrepreneurial activity, architectural activity,</p>
<p t="1449080" d="1380">cooking...</p>
<p t="1451020" d="2520">there's a handful of others... singing, etc...</p>
<p t="1454240" d="3480">you know, the sorts of things that you would assume that people could be creative about --</p>
<p t="1457720" d="4620">and then it asks people to rate themselves on a scale from 1 to 10</p>
<p t="1462820" d="4560">on their level of achievement with regards to all those creative domains</p>
<p t="1467380" d="4300">with zero being ";I have no training or proficiency in this area,";</p>
<p t="1471680" d="5140">and 70% of people score zero across the entire Creative Achievement Questionnaire.</p>
<p t="1477360" d="6160">A tiny proportion of people are outliers, way out, and they're creative in many dimensions simultaneously.</p>
<p t="1483740" d="1600">Exceptionally creative.</p>
<p t="1485340" d="4300">It turns out, as you'll find out, that that pattern, which is called a Pareto distribution,</p>
<p t="1489680" d="5300">where most people stack up at zero and a few people are way out on the creative end</p>
<p t="1495780" d="4240">characterizes all sorts of distributions, like the distribution of money, for example.</p>
<p t="1500020" d="6180">Which is why 1% of the people have the overwhelming majority of the money.</p>
<p t="1506540" d="2640">It's a different 1% across time.</p>
<p t="1509540" d="1180">It churns.</p>
<p t="1511180" d="4800">And you're much more likely to be in the 1% if you're older, logically enough,</p>
<p t="1515980" d="4800">because one of the things you do as you age is you trade youth for money.</p>
<p t="1520780" d="1540">If you're fortunate.</p>
<p t="1522320" d="3620">I don't think the trade is really worth it, but that's the best you've got.</p>
<p t="1526700" d="1260">So, anyways...</p>
<p t="1528400" d="5260">Those particular traits, you can think of those as ways that you simplify the world, right?</p>
<p t="1533840" d="4060">There's lots of different places that you can act in the world,</p>
<p t="1537900" d="2740">and there's lots of different ways you can look at it and survive.</p>
<p t="1540640" d="5500">That's why you can be a plumber, and a lawyer, and an engineer, and those all work, right,</p>
<p t="1546360" d="2000">even though they're very different modes of being.</p>
<p t="1548620" d="5080">And you can have different personalities, and survive, as long as you're capable of</p>
<p t="1554400" d="5400">finding the place where your particular filters and behavioral proclivities</p>
<p t="1559800" d="2140">match the demand of the environment.</p>
<p t="1561980" d="4800">And a huge part, I would say, of successful adaptation is precisely that.</p>
<p t="1567880" d="1880">Now there are other elements of personality too.</p>
<p t="1570520" d="1700">One of the elements I've been struck by;</p>
<p t="1572220" d="5240">and this is actually one of the criticisms I have about the psychoanalysts and the clinicians in general,</p>
<p t="1577500" d="5800">(even though I have great admiration for them and would say that, what they have to say is very much worth listening to),</p>
<p t="1584680" d="3900">is that, it's not obvious that your personality is inside you.</p>
<p t="1589800" d="720">You know, you think,</p>
<p t="1591500" d="3120">you know, a human being is a strange multilevel thing.</p>
<p t="1595240" d="2060">And you might ask yourself, well for example,</p>
<p t="1598540" d="3240">";is your mother a more part of you than your arm?";,</p>
<p t="1602540" d="4820">or maybe even more precisely, ";is your child more a part of you than your arm?";.</p>
<p t="1607820" d="6540">Certainly, people will do drastically self-sacrificing things to maintain the lives of their children.</p>
<p t="1614800" d="7880">And so you're - you're a person and you're made up all sub - sort of subcomponents of a person, none of which you can seen when you look at a person.</p>
<p t="1622920" d="3560">All the complicated machinery inside you that makes you who you are, and then</p>
<p t="1626960" d="1380">outside of that of course,</p>
<p t="1629120" d="2480">you're nested in all sorts of complex system</p>
<p t="1631600" d="6500">so you're part of the family, and - and you're part of a community, and that's part of a province, and that's part of state, and that's part of...</p>
<p t="1638100" d="7700">an international consortium of states, and that's part of an ecosystem, and how you make a distinction</p>
<p t="1645800" d="6320">...between you and the systems that you're embeded in is also of extraordinary difficulty.</p>
<p t="1652820" d="5760">One of the things you have to do as a clinical psychologist, for example, if you're trying to diagnose someone with depression,</p>
<p t="1658580" d="3320">...you think ";Well, this person is dreadfully unhappy";.</p>
<p t="1661900" d="4580">Well, you can think about that as a problem with their psychological adjustment -</p>
<p t="1666480" d="2400">you know, the way that they're looking at the world.</p>
<p t="1669200" d="2000">But, if you look at the...</p>
<p t="1671660" d="2880">...epidemiological literature, for example,</p>
<p t="1674540" d="3600">...one of the things that you find is that very many people...</p>
<p t="1678580" d="5020">...have a first depressive episode after something genuinely terrible has happened to them.</p>
<p t="1683980" d="2600">Right? They've lost someone or they've become injured or...</p>
<p t="1686580" d="4300">..or they've become unemployed - because unemployment is a terrible shock to people...</p>
<p t="1690880" d="9640">...and it's not precisely self-evident that you can consider someone who's unhappy and desperate - because they no longer have a job - depressed.</p>
<p t="1702240" d="3180">They're certainly sad and they're not doing very well, but...</p>
<p t="1705820" d="2380">...the fact that they no longer have an income...</p>
<p t="1708200" d="4420">...is actually something with traumatic practical consequences,</p>
<p t="1712620" d="4800">...and treating that as if it's a mental disorder seems to be...</p>
<p t="1717620" d="1140">counterproductive.</p>
<p t="1718900" d="2640">It's also the case, for example, that if you're...</p>
<p t="1721540" d="4220">...if someone comes in to you, to talk to you, and they're very upset and...</p>
<p t="1725760" d="5460">...they may manifest the sings of, say, an anxiety disorder or, again, depression or other...</p>
<p t="1731220" d="2160">...other clinical features, for that matter,</p>
<p t="1733440" d="500">...ahem...</p>
<p t="1734620" d="4980">...you have to do a careful analysis of the manner in which they're embeded in their family because,</p>
<p t="1740060" d="2140">...and this is something that we'll talk about quite...</p>
<p t="1743280" d="500">...</p>
<p t="1744520" d="2660">...thoroughly when we come to discussing Freud, is that,</p>
<p t="1747180" d="4860">well, you know, it's not like everybody's families are necessarily, particularly happy places to be.</p>
<p t="1752040" d="960">you know, i mean...</p>
<p t="1753180" d="1640">...human being are very dependent.</p>
<p t="1754860" d="3240">We have a very long period of dependency, partly because...</p>
<p t="1758100" d="5520">we're so cortically hyper-developed that takes a very long time to program us into something that's...</p>
<p t="1763620" d="3680">vaguely capable of maneuvering on its own, and...</p>
<p t="1767360" d="4180">That produces, of course, the very tight familial bonds that we all...</p>
<p t="1771600" d="2160">...that we all desperately require,</p>
<p t="1773760" d="2200">because - who wants to be alone in the world?...</p>
<p t="1776040" d="900">...but it also...</p>
<p t="1777580" d="5520">it also exposes us to the probability of becoming entangled into...</p>
<p t="1783160" d="2960">...even multigenerational family pathology</p>
<p t="1786720" d="5200">...and it isn't obvious, always and certainly hasn't been to me when I've seen my clients</p>
<p t="1791920" d="4160">that the fundamental problem with the client, is the client</p>
<p t="1796080" d="2000">Sometimes, the fundamental problem is...</p>
<p t="1800480" d="900">...is the family.</p>
<p t="1802980" d="5120">and, and perhaps that person has been identified as the problem person.</p>
<p t="1808100" d="2220">It's rather convenient for everyone who's involved</p>
<p t="1810600" d="1720">to make that presupposition.</p>
<p t="1813020" d="1280">It's also the case that,</p>
<p t="1815200" d="3500">this is the Freudian idea fundamentally, this is the (unintelligible) idea that</p>
<p t="1819480" d="1180">it's very easy for</p>
<p t="1820880" d="2400">people to become over dependent on their parents</p>
<p t="1823280" d="2380">and, and for the parents to facilitate that,</p>
<p t="1826000" d="3340">and then for the primary developmental problem</p>
<p t="1830120" d="1260">for the individual,</p>
<p t="1831860" d="6740">if fact to become free of interfering elements of the family</p>
<p t="1838660" d="4420">so that they can exist as independent individuals, well,</p>
<p t="1843800" d="5100">and then of course there are cultural variations in  that, that make that proposition complex,</p>
<p t="1849080" d="4100">but, that's a fundamental tenant, say, of Freudian psychology.</p>
<p t="1853360" d="900">A lot of</p>
<p t="1855000" d="2000">the clinical psychologists,</p>
<p t="1857000" d="2480">all of whom, that we're going to study,</p>
<p t="1859720" d="2620">have a pronounced western orientation.</p>
<p t="1862620" d="2680">One of the fundamental presuppositions is that</p>
<p t="1866040" d="1340">part of the hallmark of</p>
<p t="1868060" d="1900">positive psychological development</p>
<p t="1870400" d="3320">is the creation of an individual that's capable of acting</p>
<p t="1873840" d="1820">independently,  and that's</p>
<p t="1876000" d="2020">I would say an implicit ideal</p>
<p t="1878180" d="3140">that lurks at the bottom of the clinical presuppositions</p>
<p t="1881500" d="2800">of all the theorists that are classic</p>
<p t="1884620" d="1140">psychologists.</p>
<p t="1886620" d="820">So,</p>
<p t="1891500" d="1460">That's a very old picture.</p>
<p t="1894680" d="2160">It's Jonah emerging from the whale.</p>
<p t="1897160" d="1280">It's a variant of a,</p>
<p t="1898840" d="620">a myth.</p>
<p t="1900300" d="840">The myth is,</p>
