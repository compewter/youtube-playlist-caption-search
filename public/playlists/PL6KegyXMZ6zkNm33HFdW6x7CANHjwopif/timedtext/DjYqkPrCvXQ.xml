<p t="8470" d="13570">So I want to continue talking about this basic
story or sub personality or game or map.</p>
<p t="22040" d="9660">So what I've discussed with you so far is
that there are different ways that you can</p>
<p t="31700" d="9780">construe the objects and territories that
you inhabit, and that modern people generally</p>
<p t="41480" d="9910">think that the world they inhabit is one that's
defined by science, but I would say - I would</p>
<p t="51390" d="5960">say actually it depends on which scientist
you mean because I don't believe that the</p>
<p t="57350" d="5630">worldview that emerges as a logical consequence
of Darwinism is the same worldview that emerges</p>
<p t="62980" d="7131">as a logical consequence of Newtonian presuppositions
and you know the reason I'm bringing Newton</p>
<p t="70111" d="4899">into it is because we still think in Newtonian
terms and it's been more than a hundred</p>
<p t="75010" d="5690">years or about a hundred years I guess, since
Newton's model was expanded by quantum physics,</p>
<p t="80700" d="4770">but no one thinks that way because you can't
think that way and besides that, the reason</p>
<p t="85470" d="4890">you don't think that way is because at the
level of resolution that you exist, things</p>
<p t="90360" d="7950">behave in a Newtonian manner so it's in
accordance with some of our natural perceptions.</p>
<p t="98310" d="8080">Now, I started thinking this way for a variety
of reasons but I was influenced later by a</p>
<p t="106390" d="5260">guy named Gibson - JJ Gibson, who wrote a
book called “An Ecological Approach to Visual</p>
<p t="111650" d="1180">Perception.”</p>
<p t="112830" d="6380">And he made the case, quite strongly, that
what you directly perceive is the implication</p>
<p t="119210" d="2520">of situations and objects.</p>
<p t="121730" d="5780">So for example, I suppose you've all seen
the famous visual cliff experiment with babies</p>
<p t="127510" d="9680">where if you put a piece of glass across an
open space and the space is evidently deep,</p>
<p t="137190" d="4510">the baby won't cross the glass and so there's
some evidence there for relatively innate,</p>
<p t="141700" d="1310">not only depth processing.</p>
<p t="143010" d="6230">It's not just depth processing, right, because
in order to not crawl off that, you also have</p>
<p t="149240" d="5359">to perceive that - well Gibson would say that
it's a falling off place, and he would say</p>
<p t="154599" d="4360">that's actually what you perceive is a falling
off place and then maybe you can extract out</p>
<p t="158959" d="8411">the idea of cliff, but that isn't what you
perceive and you know, the sense you have</p>
<p t="167370" d="6080">when a bear is chasing you that's dangerous,
that doesn't seem to be merely psychological</p>
<p t="173450" d="6649">in a sense like it's not merely, in a sense,
not - it's not less real than perceiving</p>
<p t="180099" d="1591">the bear as an object.</p>
<p t="181690" d="7710">An object that eats you is not the same object
as an object that remains neutral to you or</p>
<p t="189400" d="6120">positive, and it seems quite clear, and this
is where the Darwinian issue I think arises,</p>
<p t="195520" d="10380">that you have to evaluate with your perception
because otherwise you're too slow.</p>
<p t="205900" d="8770">So anyways, I developed this diagram as a
consequence of thinking about these things</p>
<p t="214670" d="6630">for a long time, and the diagram is predicated
on the idea that when you begin to act in</p>
<p t="221300" d="6630">the world, you're inside a motivational frame,
let's say, and that motivational frame can</p>
<p t="227930" d="9880">be instantiated or put into practice or put
into place by any number of underlying motivational</p>
<p t="237810" d="7940">systems, some of them the more basic motivational
systems that we share with animals going far</p>
<p t="245750" d="6599">back down the evolutionary chain and some
of them more complex mixtures of emotional</p>
<p t="252349" d="9570">or motivational drives that been organized
across lengthy periods of times in social</p>
<p t="261919" d="1870">circumstances.</p>
<p t="263789" d="9231">So for example, if you're at a bar and you're
looking for someone, it's not really reasonable</p>
<p t="273020" d="3800">to say - we'll take the simple case.</p>
<p t="276820" d="7760">It's not really reasonable to say that your
behavior is motivated by sex because that's</p>
<p t="284580" d="5590">what happens only if you're actually in a
sexual act.</p>
<p t="290170" d="4560">Before that, the motivations are multiple
and they have to be because otherwise you</p>
<p t="294730" d="5850">wouldn't have the sophistication to begin
a conversation with anyone.</p>
<p t="300580" d="7270">So to think of that as driven in some sense
by sexuality means either to consider a much</p>
<p t="307850" d="6810">more expanded notion of sexuality or to not
consider it driven in that manner.</p>
<p t="314660" d="6920">Now, I think it's reasonable to make the
presumption that you're motivated to move</p>
<p t="321580" d="4470">ahead and we know that for a variety of reasons.</p>
<p t="326050" d="4030">Partly that's because if you look at the
brain at the level of the hypothalamus which</p>
<p t="330080" d="10330">is a very, very archaic and primordial subsystem
in the brain, then it's roughly divided</p>
<p t="340410" d="6140">into two parts and one part is responsible
for a lot of the things we consider basic</p>
<p t="346550" d="6670">motivations, and the other part is responsible
for exploration.</p>
<p t="353220" d="11120">So the dopaminergic tracts whose operation
underlies movement forward and incentive reward</p>
<p t="364340" d="4889">and what you generally experience as the sorts
of positive emotion associated with hope,</p>
<p t="369229" d="5401">and excitement, and curiosity, that system
is instantiated in the hypothalamus, and a</p>
<p t="374630" d="3400">lot of the hypothalamus is devoted to it.</p>
<p t="378030" d="11070">So, as a very primordial system whose operation
appears to be a default.</p>
<p t="389100" d="8879">It's a default operation if none of the
other motivational systems need current attention.</p>
<p t="397979" d="3621">Well the other default I suppose is sleep
or rest and you can certainly see that in</p>
<p t="401600" d="4360">animals because, you know, if you have a cat
you'll notice - of course they're nocturnal,</p>
<p t="405960" d="4679">but they'll sleep a large part of the day
and so do dogs.</p>
<p t="410639" d="4412">So, you know, if you're not looking for a
partner, if you don't want to play, if you're</p>
<p t="415051" d="5799">not hungry, not thirsty, and so on, not under
the grip of any direct biological necessity</p>
<p t="420850" d="9140">let's say, then your default position is
to rest or sleep or to explore, and the thing</p>
<p t="429990" d="2840">about the exploratory circuit is it's really
old.</p>
<p t="432830" d="1890">It's as old as pain.</p>
<p t="434720" d="1780">It's as old as lust.</p>
<p t="436500" d="1220">It's as old as anger.</p>
<p t="437720" d="1590">It's as old as hunger.</p>
<p t="439310" d="1370">It's as old as thirst.</p>
<p t="440680" d="1660">Like it's a really, really old system.</p>
<p t="442340" d="7740">It's a very primordial system, and human
beings are quite hyper exploratory, at least</p>
<p t="450080" d="6880">collectively as you can tell because we keep
inventing new things and exchanging new modes</p>
<p t="456960" d="1810">of being.</p>
<p t="458770" d="8000">So, you can say in some sense that you have
a drive to engage with the world and to expand</p>
<p t="466770" d="3110">your domain of knowledge.</p>
<p t="469880" d="8200">And the reason that you have that is because
the human race has gambled on that as a sufficient</p>
<p t="478080" d="6150">means of ensuring adaptation into the future,
you know, and it's a strange one because</p>
<p t="484230" d="2330">most animals are very, very conservative.</p>
<p t="486560" d="5490">In fact, most human societies are very, very
conservative so it's certainly possible</p>
<p t="492050" d="4360">for even relatively modern human societies
- so let's say those that have arisen in</p>
<p t="496410" d="5530">the last fifty thousand years - to remain
relatively unchanged for periods during that</p>
<p t="501940" d="1650">time of up to ten thousand years.</p>
<p t="503590" d="6329">That seems to be what happened, for example,
with regards to the original inhabitants of</p>
<p t="509919" d="5920">Australia and so it's statis that's the
norm, not transformation, and you know, even</p>
<p t="515839" d="6080">societies that we feel were very dynamic like
let's say Ancient Egypt still there are</p>
<p t="521919" d="5301">indications in the archaeological records
of relatively unchanged customs and practices</p>
<p t="527220" d="4700">for periods that you would count in the thousands.</p>
<p t="531920" d="6680">So, most animals and many societies bet that
just doing the same thing over and over is</p>
<p t="538600" d="9359">gonna do the trick, and human beings - well
that isn't what we're like man.</p>
<p t="547959" d="2530">God only knows how that originally came about,
you know.</p>
<p t="550489" d="8431">It was the conjunction of many, many processes
and forces, and it would be very, very difficult</p>
<p t="558920" d="4859">to tell a complete causal story, but anyways
here we are.</p>
<p t="563779" d="8891">Now, it's reasonable to think of us as motivated
to move forward and motivated to explore,</p>
<p t="572670" d="6240">and so that's the fundamental motivation for
engaging with the world apart from anything</p>
<p t="578910" d="2730">that's a strictly lower level biological.</p>
<p t="581640" d="7210">And while we're doing that, it's also
customary for us to look at the world in terms</p>
<p t="588850" d="5729">of its utility, and I would say with human
beings that it's a very tool based utility</p>
<p t="594579" d="3480">because you know, our brain is part of our
body.</p>
<p t="598059" d="3840">Our brain is adapted to our body and our body
is adapted to our brain.</p>
<p t="601899" d="3641">Obviously they coevolved and so the kind of
brain we have is the sort of brain that a</p>
<p t="605540" d="7270">creature that stands upright and can manipulate
the world has, and we'll see some evidence</p>
<p t="612810" d="1000">of that later.</p>
<p t="613810" d="5860">But ebcause we're so handy, we can speak
with our hands and we can manipulate things</p>
<p t="619670" d="3969">with our hands and we can transform things
with our hands and we can tear things apart</p>
<p t="623639" d="7260">and we can hunt and we can plant and there's
an endless number of possibilities for hand</p>
<p t="630899" d="1321">utilization.</p>
<p t="632220" d="6619">The world appears to us arrayed out as tools,
roughly speaking, and a tool would be something</p>
<p t="638839" d="7860">- it's hard to get the word exactly right
because I like tool because tool implies something</p>
<p t="646699" d="10471">that you can use whereas Gibson would have
talked about - what did he call it?</p>
<p t="657170" d="3270">I can't remember.</p>
<p t="660440" d="3019">It'll come to me in a minute.</p>
<p t="663459" d="6440">The word reflects the fact that the world
is presenting itself to you as something you</p>
<p t="669899" d="1000">can use.</p>
<p t="670899" d="4430">Let me just look that up for a second.</p>
<p t="675329" d="2510">That's very annoying.</p>
<p t="677839" d="2521">Oh well, whatever.</p>
<p t="680360" d="4539">So naturally when you lay out the world, it
lays itself out into things that are going</p>
<p t="684899" d="7410">to be useful for you, things that are going
to get in your way, and then things that have</p>
<p t="692309" d="2210">neither property.</p>
<p t="694519" d="6230">Under most circumstances, the things that
have neither property are the overwhelming</p>
<p t="700749" d="7291">majority, and that's partly how you manage
to process the world in all of its complexity</p>
<p t="708040" d="8159">with your relatively narrow processing capacity.</p>
<p t="716199" d="4480">Most things have no significance, and they
have no significance within this very very</p>
<p t="720679" d="6220">focal frame which is if you remember the hierarchy
diagram, it's like in that hierarchy diagram,</p>
<p t="726899" d="3300">most of the time you're operating at the
level of motor interaction with the world.</p>
<p t="730199" d="3961">You're actually engaged with the world either
through articulation, but forget about that</p>
<p t="734160" d="5390">for now, or you're actually engaged moving
in the world and moving it around and interacting</p>
<p t="739550" d="1029">with it.</p>
<p t="740579" d="8661">It's as if you're viewing the world through
a series of concentric lenses and those concentric</p>
<p t="749240" d="8630">lenses exclude and then the highest resolution
lens, the one that enables you to focus closest,</p>
<p t="757870" d="6279">is the one that helps you highlight those
few things in the vast perceptual world of</p>
<p t="764149" d="6661">nothingness that seem to be critical for that
particular operation.</p>
<p t="770810" d="2639">So now, you can see that.</p>
<p t="773449" d="6640">I mean the most dramatic example of that - I
was really personally thrilled about Dan Simon's</p>
<p t="780089" d="7770">gorilla experiments because I'd been thinking
about this for a long time before that experiment</p>
<p t="787859" d="2590">came out and it was the clearest demonstration
I had seen.</p>
<p t="790449" d="3370">I mean, there's a lot of demonstrations like
that now but it was the clearest demonstration</p>
<p t="793819" d="7420">I'd ever seen that indeed most of what you're
perceptual systems do is exclude.</p>
<p t="801239" d="6700">Now what that means - this is the tricky thing
is that what that means is that wrapped up</p>
<p t="807939" d="7560">in what you exclude is the entire - is all
of being, virtually and that's a very tricky</p>
<p t="815499" d="6181">problem because when you're excluding all
of being, in some sense you're setting its</p>
<p t="821680" d="2269">value to zero.</p>
<p t="823949" d="5071">You say, “Well except for those few things
that I'm concentrating on now, everything</p>
<p t="829020" d="3739">else is zero and it's zero and unchanging.”</p>
<p t="832759" d="4480">And the problem with that is that lots of
times that's not right.</p>
<p t="837239" d="5820">Now it's right enough, luckily enough, and
I suppose this is a consequence of evolution</p>
<p t="843059" d="1280">too.</p>
<p t="844339" d="7261">We're fast enough or slow enough, depending
on how you look at it so that we can assume</p>
<p t="851600" d="5019">constancy across some span of time under some
conditions.</p>
<p t="856619" d="4741">Now, from a philosophical perspective that's
inadequate.</p>
<p t="861360" d="6039">Some of you might have heard of the phrase
“The scandal of induction.”</p>
<p t="867399" d="7781">Well, it's a pointer to a very profound
philosophical problem and the philosophical</p>
<p t="875180" d="6029">problem is how do you know the same thing
that happened before is going to happen next?</p>
<p t="881209" d="6240">And the answer to that is generally you don't
know, and it's a very tricky issue to come</p>
<p t="887449" d="3450">to terms with you know.</p>
<p t="890899" d="6650">I think you can think of things as you know,
if you think about a hierarchy of resolution</p>
<p t="897549" d="1000">again.</p>
<p t="898549" d="5530">I think you can think of things as very, rather
predictably, in their unpredictability.</p>
<p t="904079" d="4700">So for example, there's some indication that
protons decay.</p>
<p t="908779" d="4100">But they decay over such a long time frame
that the probability that that's going to</p>
<p t="912879" d="4980">affect us is virtually zero, and there's other
things that we interact with quite regularly</p>
<p t="917859" d="10431">like the sun that are stable across timeframes
that make it virtually ignorable.</p>
<p t="928290" d="5120">Well I'll tell you a story about that, and
this is a good story to indicate how everything</p>
<p t="933410" d="2500">is nested in what you ignore.</p>
<p t="935910" d="4239">So, part of this story is fictional, but part
of it isn't.</p>
<p t="940149" d="6451">So, one time when I was in graduate school
in Quebec, in Montreal, I was typing on my</p>
<p t="946600" d="9899">pre-hard drive computer and it stopped, and
you know computers do that and so what happens</p>
<p t="956499" d="1620">when your computer stops?</p>
<p t="958119" d="3630">Well, the first thing that happens is it depends
on what you're working on.</p>
<p t="961749" d="2611">That's the critical issue right?</p>
<p t="964360" d="6579">So what happens is that you have a reaction
that's proportionate to the deemed importance</p>
<p t="970939" d="3950">of what it was that you're working on and
there's going to be an association between</p>
<p t="974889" d="4611">that and deadlines, and there's going to be
an association between that and amount written</p>
<p t="979500" d="3809">that you think you might have lost, and then.</p>
<p t="983309" d="5541">So there's, there's - because what you're
doing is nested in a hierarchy, you know,</p>
<p t="988850" d="5949">I'm writing a sentence to write a paragraph
to write a essay to hand the essay in to fulfill</p>
<p t="994799" d="6880">a requirement of class to graduate, etc. all
the way up the nested hierarchy.</p>
<p t="1001679" d="7740">You're going to be upset in proportion to
the upset - or to the cost of this failure</p>
<p t="1009419" d="1801">in terms of that entire structure.</p>
<p t="1011220" d="3970">So you do a rough estimate eh, because you
don't really know and generally you don't</p>
<p t="1015190" d="3940">assume the worst although you might immediately
because that's the sort of situation where</p>
<p t="1019130" d="3549">someone will go - they'll get angry, or
I will anyways.</p>
<p t="1022679" d="5551">I'll pound my first on the - and then I'll
curse Microsoft usually or whoever happened</p>
<p t="1028230" d="4920">to make the computer, and then I'll remember
I can usually fix computers if there's something</p>
<p t="1033150" d="3809">wrong with them and that probably all it needs
to do is to be rebooted and so forth.</p>
<p t="1036959" d="6661">And so what happens to begin with is a burst
of emotion and the reason for that is that</p>
<p t="1043620" d="5720">the significance of the unexpected event cannot
be easily constrained, and that's because</p>
<p t="1049340" d="2650">there's so many things that might gone wrong.</p>
<p t="1051990" d="6649">Now, you know, because the worst case scenario
is maybe your computer is dead, and then that's</p>
<p t="1058639" d="4910">a problem for all sorts of reasons we don't
have to go into, and it's not just a technical</p>
<p t="1063549" d="1000">problem right?</p>
<p t="1064549" d="5051">It's also a political, and social, and economic
problem, weirdly enough, because then when</p>
<p t="1069600" d="3850">you go buy a computer you have to figure out,
well who's the manufacturer and where's</p>
<p t="1073450" d="3160">the manufacturing done, and what's a high
quality computer, and it's like good luck</p>
<p t="1076610" d="4270">figuring that out because they change every
month so you just can't keep track of it.</p>
<p t="1080880" d="4700">So it opens up a whole rat's nest, or hornet's
nest of problems - or a pit of snakes which</p>
<p t="1085580" d="2209">is a better way of thinking about it.</p>
<p t="1087789" d="1000">Okay so, fine.</p>
<p t="1088789" d="2760">So, my computer's dead so I try to reboot
it.</p>
<p t="1091549" d="4071">Doesn't reboot, and so I think I don't know,
maybe it's burned out or maybe there's something</p>
<p t="1095620" d="1000">wrong with the plug.</p>
<p t="1096620" d="5000">So I plug a lamp into the same outlet and
I try to turn on the lamp and the lamp doesn't</p>
<p t="1101620" d="1150">go on, so then I think aha!</p>
<p t="1102770" d="4700">I blew a fuse because this place had fuses
so fine.</p>
<p t="1107470" d="3650">So I go to the fuse box, and it's daytime
so it's not a problem, and I look at the</p>
<p t="1111120" d="4410">fuses and there's nothing wrong with the fuses
and so I think well I'll go down to the</p>
<p t="1115530" d="5420">corner store and get a cigarette because I
smoked at that time, and I'll think about</p>
<p t="1120950" d="1000">it on the way.</p>
<p t="1121950" d="2290">So I go outside and all the street lights
are off.</p>
<p t="1124240" d="1630">So the whole city's come to a halt.</p>
<p t="1125870" d="1939">I think, oh there's a power outage.</p>
<p t="1127809" d="3990">It's like yeah there was a power outage,
and here's what happened.</p>
<p t="1131799" d="2631">A solar flare emerged from the sun, surfacing.</p>
<p t="1134430" d="6810">It was a whopping big one, and a solar flare
like that sends out a wind, essentially, of</p>
<p t="1141240" d="7360">charged particles that come zooming towards
the Earth and we're protected from them</p>
<p t="1148600" d="7059">for a variety of reasons, including the fact
that the Earth is magnetic and for complicated</p>
<p t="1155659" d="5301">reasons, that helps protect us from cosmic
rays which is really a good thing as far as</p>
<p t="1160960" d="1000">I'm concerned.</p>
<p t="1161960" d="5360">But now and then those things are so powerful
that they'll - well here's an example.</p>
<p t="1167320" d="4150">If you have a hydrogen bomb, a big one, and
you detonate it in the middle of North America</p>
<p t="1171470" d="5089">in the atmosphere, high up, you'll wipe
out all the electronics in the entire continent</p>
<p t="1176559" d="4381">permanently because what happens is that when
the bomb goes off, there's an electromagnetic</p>
<p t="1180940" d="5530">pulse and that produces an electric current
that runs through the wiring, and that'll</p>
<p t="1186470" d="6559">be of - very brief obviously but of sufficient
intensity to fry the electronics.</p>
<p t="1193029" d="2201">So, well that's what the sun is.</p>
<p t="1195230" d="4820">The sun is a massive hydrogen bomb and so
now and then it goes off with the force of,</p>
<p t="1200050" d="6129">you know, millions of hydrogen bombs and then
we get the pulse radiating towards us and</p>
<p t="1206179" d="5761">then it sets a current in the power grid which
what happened here and takes out the whole</p>
<p t="1211940" d="1000">power grid.</p>
<p t="1212940" d="1449">That's what happened at that point.</p>
<p t="1214389" d="4731">The Quebec power grid was down for awhile,
and it was because - so that's why my computer</p>
<p t="1219120" d="4960">crashed is because the sun wasn't as stable
as I thought it was.</p>
<p t="1224080" d="7299">That gives you an example of just how interconnected
things are and how much you're taking for</p>
<p t="1231379" d="4061">granted when you make anything invisible.</p>
<p t="1235440" d="4160">I would say that part of what happens in a
civilized society - we'll say a civilized</p>
<p t="1239600" d="6199">and productive society - is that there are
rules of conduct in place and there are effective</p>
<p t="1245799" d="5360">processes in place so that most of the time
you can rely on things being like they were</p>
<p t="1251159" d="1091">yesterday.</p>
<p t="1252250" d="6750">So for example, our power supply is unbelievably
reliable given that it's so intrinsically</p>
<p t="1259000" d="1180">unstable.</p>
<p t="1260180" d="4520">People have to beetle around nonstop just
to keep the power on, but they do and so we</p>
<p t="1264700" d="6490">can sit here and ignore it, and we can concentrate
on something more arcane and much more focused</p>
<p t="1271190" d="6301">but it's also because it's a relatively
peaceful society and we have relatively peaceful</p>
<p t="1277491" d="4989">free speech and so on and so forth, and you
can predict with a high degree of certainty</p>
<p t="1282480" d="3890">that if you come to class, then what's going
to happen in the class - the worst that's</p>
<p t="1286370" d="5269">going to happen in the class, likely, is that
you're either going to get bored or hot.</p>
<p t="1291639" d="2731">So that's not so bad you know.</p>
<p t="1294370" d="5639">Alright so you're going from point A to point
B, and you see your tools.</p>
<p t="1300009" d="3061">I still haven't remembered that damn word.</p>
<p t="1303070" d="4910">What the hell is that damn word?</p>
<p t="1307980" d="2460">That's so annoying.</p>
<p t="1310440" d="1000">Nope.</p>
<p t="1311440" d="1000">Whatever.</p>
<p t="1312440" d="1290">You go along and you see these tools.</p>
<p t="1313730" d="6069">These are things that are going to help get
you to your goal, and whenever you see those,</p>
<p t="1319799" d="5571">you get a burst of positive emotion and basically
that means two things, that positive emotion.</p>
<p t="1325370" d="5159">Think about it as a little dopamine kick,
and this is where this story differentiates</p>
<p t="1330529" d="1851">a little bit from classic behaviorism.</p>
<p t="1332380" d="3879">So the behaviorists would say you get a little
dopamine kick and that increases the probability</p>
<p t="1336259" d="6182">that the action that you just took will be
taken again in the future, and so it's partly</p>
<p t="1342441" d="8698">because the dopamine kick has a positive emotional
- it provides a positive emotional experience</p>
<p t="1351139" d="5410">but it's also because the dopamine facilitates
neural growth, and so if you're beetling along</p>
<p t="1356549" d="4651">and something good happens to you, then your
brain makes the things you were doing - the</p>
<p t="1361200" d="3170">circuits that underlie the things you were
doing just before the good thing happened</p>
<p t="1364370" d="2360">- a little bit stronger.</p>
<p t="1366730" d="7419">But, the other thing that happens when you're
beetling along and doing your positive thing</p>
<p t="1374149" d="4561">is that you get a little dopamine - is that
the fact that it's working also validates</p>
<p t="1378710" d="6000">your frame of reference because you know you
know might say well, if what you're doing</p>
<p t="1384710" d="5140">is lurking and you're getting what you want,
how is it that you're right?</p>
<p t="1389850" d="6439">And the answer to that is well in some ways,
you're right enough up the entire hierarchy</p>
<p t="1396289" d="6350">and so what that means is that every time
you proceed along the path that you've chosen</p>
<p t="1402639" d="5231">and that's working, that entire structure
gets stabilized a bit more, and that's how</p>
<p t="1407870" d="1269">it should be.</p>
<p t="1409139" d="6301">Now, I've tried to work out how exactly this
happens and I can give you the best example</p>
<p t="1415440" d="1350">by telling you about cocaine addicts.</p>
<p t="1416790" d="7609">So, addicts 
use to have this phrase.</p>
<p t="1424399" d="1990">“Monkey on my back.”</p>
<p t="1426389" d="8951">And that phrase referred to the compulsion,
the compulsive sub personality that develops</p>
<p t="1435340" d="3480">that's interested in nothing but more of the
substance.</p>
<p t="1438820" d="4870">Now, you know, you think about that as being
hooked and you might think about it as a motivational</p>
<p t="1443690" d="3410">drive or a biological drive, but the thing
is it's not like that.</p>
<p t="1447100" d="3760">We're just not that deterministic.</p>
<p t="1450860" d="5309">An addicted person has grown an addicted sub
personality.</p>
<p t="1456169" d="1201">And I mean grown.</p>
<p t="1457370" d="2080">It's not psychological.</p>
<p t="1459450" d="3040">It's psychophysiological.</p>
<p t="1462490" d="1559">So imagine this.</p>
<p t="1464049" d="1960">Imagine this is how it works.</p>
<p t="1466009" d="4410">I'll first tell you what happens to cocaine
addicts if you take them out into a treatment</p>
<p t="1470419" d="1000">center.</p>
<p t="1471419" d="3321">Heroin addicts is the same thing, roughly
speaking.</p>
<p t="1474740" d="6600">So you take this person who's dependant
out to a treatment center, and with heroin,</p>
<p t="1481340" d="3120">say, you have to let them go through withdrawal.</p>
<p t="1484460" d="6160">And that takes about forty eight hours, something
like that, and you've seen movie representations</p>
<p t="1490620" d="6279">of it, but it's been compared by reasonable
observers to having a very bad flu.</p>
<p t="1496899" d="4671">So, alcohol withdrawal, by the way - that
kills you often.</p>
<p t="1501570" d="1609">You have a seizure and you die.</p>
<p t="1503179" d="3830">So if you're an alcoholic and you go to the
hospital and you need to detoxify, they'll</p>
<p t="1507009" d="5121">give you valium or something like that so
you don't seize yourself to death while you're</p>
<p t="1512130" d="1000">withdrawing.</p>
<p t="1513130" d="3590">You know, when you have a hangover, part of
that is that - part of what's happened is</p>
<p t="1516720" d="2180">you've actually lowered your seizure threshold.</p>
<p t="1518900" d="3509">Something to think about if you're prone to
seizures.</p>
<p t="1522409" d="2650">It's a bad idea to have a hangover.</p>
<p t="1525059" d="2401">In fact they bred mice to study hangovers.</p>
<p t="1527460" d="4329">They bred mice that could drink alcohol and
then they'd get a very bad hangover, and</p>
<p t="1531789" d="2281">if you showed them a cat, they would have
a seizure.</p>
<p t="1534070" d="3030">So, because the fear was enough to trigger
seizures.</p>
<p t="1537100" d="7939">So yeah, well you gotta get seizures going
somehow if you're gonna study them, and that's</p>
<p t="1545039" d="2311">- and that can be bred.</p>
<p t="1547350" d="6600">So anyways, you take your heroin addict, let's
say, and they get over their withdrawal and</p>
<p t="1553950" d="5010">so that means that technically they're no
longer physiologically dependant on the drug.</p>
<p t="1558960" d="5870">Now that doesn't mean their work is over by
no means.</p>
<p t="1564830" d="4330">But frequently the treatment center, as long
as the person is nowhere near where they usually</p>
<p t="1569160" d="6519">are, once they've gone through withdrawal,
they can stay away from the drug quite effectively,</p>
<p t="1575679" d="6941">but the problem is as soon as you put them
back in the situation that they came from,</p>
<p t="1582620" d="3720">and they're around the things that have been
associated with heroin, let's say, they get</p>
<p t="1586340" d="2439">a craving.</p>
<p t="1588779" d="2091">And the cravings haven't gone away.</p>
<p t="1590870" d="5400">That's a different system than the system
that went through withdrawal, and so they</p>
<p t="1596270" d="3200">always relapse.</p>
<p t="1599470" d="7970">Now, you think about how this craving works,
and I've seen this probably most seriously</p>
<p t="1607440" d="4309">I guess with cocaine addicts, but also with
alcoholics.</p>
<p t="1611749" d="5211">So, imagine what you have to do in order to
become an addict.</p>
<p t="1616960" d="4070">You know, the first thing is that you have
to start using the drug.</p>
<p t="1621030" d="3629">Okay, but that - and fair enough.</p>
<p t="1624659" d="4921">People experiment with all sorts of drugs
and so, you know, that's part of human nature.</p>
<p t="1629580" d="3209">You know, it's risky and dangerous but it's
not yet catastrophic.</p>
<p t="1632789" d="4510">But then let's say you start using it enough
so that you can't not use it.</p>
<p t="1637299" d="4230">You have to use it everyday or something like
that, and then the next thing that happens</p>
<p t="1641529" d="4730">is that it gets a little bit expensive, and
so then your life is starting to go downhill</p>
<p t="1646259" d="2880">because you're spending all your time trying
to gather resources to get some more of the</p>
<p t="1649139" d="1130">drug.</p>
<p t="1650269" d="6331">Now, what you might ask yourself is what do
you have - like exactly what's the chain</p>
<p t="1656600" d="3800">of behaviors that's being reinforced by the
drug?</p>
<p t="1660400" d="6941">Well somewhere along the way, you know, maybe
when you're just starting to misuse it, there's</p>
<p t="1667341" d="8028">part of you that's saying, “You know, really
this is probably not a good idea.”</p>
<p t="1675369" d="3410">And then there's another part of you that
has a different thought which might be, “Oh</p>
<p t="1678779" d="1010">to hell with it.</p>
<p t="1679789" d="1470">It's only one.</p>
<p t="1681259" d="1471">It's only tonight.”</p>
<p t="1682730" d="4949">And so then you take the drug, and then there's
chain leading from the thought to the drug</p>
<p t="1687679" d="2610">behavior.</p>
<p t="1690289" d="3590">But the drug reinforces all the way back along
that chain.</p>
<p t="1693879" d="3800">So what happens is that little system that
thinks, “Oh to hell with it, it's only</p>
<p t="1697679" d="3320">one night,” gets a little stronger.</p>
<p t="1700999" d="6601">Now, it doesn't get as strong as the systems
that are being reinforced that are activated</p>
<p t="1707600" d="9130">directly before the drug hit, but the thing
is that maybe you take heroin in fifty different</p>
<p t="1716730" d="4029">situations and so you're conditioning yourself
to cues in all those different situations.</p>
<p t="1720759" d="4221">You use slightly different behaviors and so
on, so there's different things being shaped,</p>
<p t="1724980" d="4600">but one of the things that's always being
reinforced, even though not that much, is</p>
<p t="1729580" d="5429">this thought pattern, and the thought pattern
is something like “Oh to hell with it, doesn't</p>
<p t="1735009" d="4010">matter anyways” because you have to think
that in order to - especially at the beginning</p>
<p t="1739019" d="2140">of a nice downhill trip.</p>
<p t="1741159" d="4291">You have to think that, and so what happens
is you build this monster in your head.</p>
<p t="1745450" d="6329">It's full of lies and rationalizations,
and they are whatever lies and rationalizations</p>
<p t="1751779" d="4150">allowed you to continue the behavior to begin
with.</p>
<p t="1755929" d="4791">But you're making them more and more potent,
and so you build a sub personality inside</p>
<p t="1760720" d="4920">of you that it's a one eyed monster, fundamentally.</p>
<p t="1765640" d="6380">All it wants is the drug, and it's armed
with any number of perfectly, depends on how</p>
<p t="1772020" d="1560">smart you are, you know.</p>
<p t="1773580" d="8150">You can come up with a very powerful, nihilistic
rational argument why - about why life is</p>
<p t="1781730" d="4949">futile and your future is dead and there's
nothing better to do anyways, and you'd be</p>
<p t="1786679" d="4181">a fool to engage in such a destructive society,
and etcetera, etcetera.</p>
<p t="1790860" d="5610">Like you can conjure up a very - an argument
that's virtually impermeable to rational</p>
<p t="1796470" d="2880">argument.</p>
<p t="1799350" d="3730">Rational counterargument.</p>
<p t="1803080" d="2780">Because you know, there's some things that
you just can't prove.</p>
<p t="1805860" d="8470">Like you can't prove life is intrinsically
worthwhile you know, because for obvious reasons.</p>
<p t="1814330" d="5780">So, now the reason I told you that is because
I think it's a good example of how things</p>
<p t="1820110" d="6939">are nested inside of each other you know,
and also the relationship between this very</p>
<p t="1827049" d="4651">large nesting of concentric lenses, let's
say, and the way that those things are shaped</p>
<p t="1831700" d="2349">and reinforced across time.</p>
<p t="1834049" d="4901">Whenever you're acting locally, and something
goes the way you want it to, let's say,</p>
<p t="1838950" d="3799">and not the way you expect because that's
what Sokolov, and Vinogradova, and Jeffrey</p>
<p t="1842749" d="3851">Gray, and the people who were looking at the
orienting response first presumed.</p>
<p t="1846600" d="5319">They'd presumed that you wanted things to
go the way you expect, but that's not exactly</p>
<p t="1851919" d="2701">right, and it's an important distinction.</p>
<p t="1854620" d="4919">You want things to go the way you want them
to go, and if it's just expectation then</p>
<p t="1859539" d="2980">it's just a cold, cognitive model of the
world right.</p>
<p t="1862519" d="1461">It's like robotic.</p>
<p t="1863980" d="2079">Okay, A happened, now B should happen.</p>
<p t="1866059" d="1000">Now C should happen.</p>
<p t="1867059" d="2100">It's like that isn't how you think at all.</p>
<p t="1869159" d="4421">You're always inside a motivational frame,
and it isn't only that you expect the next</p>
<p t="1873580" d="5620">thing to happen, but if the next thing happens,
it matters whether it's what you want or</p>
<p t="1879200" d="1000">not.</p>
<p t="1880200" d="4039">If it's what you want, then that little
system is reinforced.</p>
<p t="1884239" d="5711">It's pleasurable for you, and then the whole
hierarchy grows a little bit stronger, and</p>
<p t="1889950" d="4589">if it is not what you want then you have a
problem.</p>
<p t="1894539" d="2731">And that's where things get weird and interesting.</p>
<p t="1897270" d="6479">So okay, so you're going along from point
A to point B, and you can see tools and you</p>
<p t="1903749" d="4170">can see obstacles, and obstacles are anything
that get in your path.</p>
<p t="1907919" d="3921">What that means in some sense is that what
a tool is and what an obstacle is switches</p>
<p t="1911840" d="4010">very rapidly as you change focus, and as your
intent changes.</p>
<p t="1915850" d="2039">So it's a dynamic system.</p>
<p t="1917889" d="5730">Alright, and so the way emotion works in this
regard is if things are going the way you</p>
<p t="1923619" d="4981">want them to then you feel positive emotion
and that keeps you moving towards your goal,</p>
<p t="1928600" d="3740">and if you run into an obstacle, then you
feel negative emotion.</p>
<p t="1932340" d="7640">Okay so, the next issue might be well just
exactly what should you experience when you</p>
<p t="1939980" d="1199">experience negative emotion?</p>
<p t="1941179" d="9261">Well you might say well that's a tricky question
because if you encounter an obstacle, that</p>
<p t="1950440" d="4679">means that something about your model is wrong
because if it was right, you wouldn't have</p>
<p t="1955119" d="1000">encountered that obstacle.</p>
<p t="1956119" d="2760">So this is a very interesting way of thinking.</p>
<p t="1958879" d="5640">It's a pragmatic way of thinking because
what it illustrates is that whenever you do</p>
<p t="1964519" d="7870">something, you're acting out a theory of truth,
and the theory of truth is the actions that</p>
<p t="1972389" d="5000">I'm undertaking at the moment are sufficient
to reach the goal that I'm aiming at, and</p>
<p t="1977389" d="5000">so you set up a theory of truth with each
act.</p>
<p t="1982389" d="7461">So, you're always struck with the reality
of truth and error or correct and incorrect</p>
<p t="1989850" d="7399">because you can't posit that a goal is worth
having, and if there's a path to it that might</p>
<p t="1997249" d="6411">be clear or obstructed without also saying
it matters whether you know what you're doing.</p>
<p t="2003660" d="7639">Okay, so you hit an obstacle, and that produces
negative emotion.</p>
<p t="2011299" d="7590">Now, the problem you have here is that in
principle, the reason you hit that obstacle</p>
<p t="2018889" d="5931">could be that there's an error in your nested
model at any level of the model.</p>
<p t="2024820" d="2800">So and that's why I told you about the little
story of the sun.</p>
<p t="2027620" d="4960">It's like normally you just turn your computer
on and off because something has happened</p>
<p t="2032580" d="4969">that's local, but now and then your problem
is that the sun isn't as reliable as you might</p>
<p t="2037549" d="1610">like it to be.</p>
<p t="2039159" d="6071">And so, you're faced with this insanely complex
problem not when things go right because when</p>
<p t="2045230" d="3960">things go right, you can just continue ignoring
everything that you're ignoring, but when</p>
<p t="2049190" d="6190">they go wrong, the search space that opens
up before you is just about infinite.</p>
<p t="2055380" d="3279">Now, that has real world consequences.</p>
<p t="2058659" d="4591">I mean, one of the things that happens when
people develop panic disorder - what seems</p>
<p t="2063250" d="1570">to happen is that…</p>
<p t="2064820" d="5039">I can tell you the typical story about how
you would develop panic disorder with agoraphobia</p>
<p t="2069859" d="1611">cause the two things are somewhat separate.</p>
<p t="2071470" d="4050">So generally this happens to - it generally
happens to women.</p>
<p t="2075520" d="1970">It generally happens in their forties.</p>
<p t="2077490" d="5760">Women are more susceptible to anxiety and
depression, and men are more susceptible to</p>
<p t="2083250" d="7169">substance abuse and antisocial behavior.</p>
<p t="2090419" d="2311">Figures that something would go wrong right
now doesn't it?</p>
<p t="2092730" d="3199">Okay, so now what do I ask myself?</p>
<p t="2095929" d="1601">Well, is this relevant.</p>
<p t="2097530" d="1660">Is it going to disrupt the class?</p>
<p t="2099190" d="3869">Does it mean that there's something wrong
with my computer?</p>
<p t="2103059" d="2601">Should I call the help people?</p>
<p t="2105660" d="6840">And I'll say no we'll ignore it on the
assumption it will continue working, and until</p>
<p t="2112500" d="2829">that hypothesis fails then we can ignore it.</p>
<p t="2115329" d="3500">Okay so…</p>
<p t="2118829" d="3191">So something goes wrong and this search space
opens up in front of you.</p>
<p t="2122020" d="1890">Now okay, back to the agoraphobic.</p>
<p t="2123910" d="5889">So what happens to her usually is generally
these are people who've had dependant relationships</p>
<p t="2129799" d="8081">and perhaps they had a relatively overprotective
family, or let's just say protective family,</p>
<p t="2137880" d="5679">and then they had an intimate relationship
early in their life and maybe that lasted</p>
<p t="2143559" d="7431">quite a long time or maybe they're just married
to the same guy, but the - and inside that</p>
<p t="2150990" d="4160">relationship, she's relatively dependant
which means probably she doesn't go anywhere</p>
<p t="2155150" d="5410">without her husband, you know, she doesn't
do a lot of things autonomously let's say.</p>
<p t="2160560" d="10269">Okay, so then she hits menopause and you know,
she's getting some strange physiological</p>
<p t="2170829" d="3691">symptoms from that of various sorts.</p>
<p t="2174520" d="5780">And maybe at the same time, maybe she talks
to her husband about a divorce or maybe he</p>
<p t="2180300" d="4860">talks to her about a divorce or maybe her
sister gets divorced or maybe a close friend</p>
<p t="2185160" d="7880">dies or maybe she starts to experience heart
palpitations because of the menopause.</p>
<p t="2193040" d="4690">And then she thinks, “Oh my god.</p>
<p t="2197730" d="2190">That could happen to me.</p>
<p t="2199920" d="2470">It's like my whole world can fall apart.”</p>
<p t="2202390" d="1240">So that's one fear.</p>
<p t="2203630" d="2100">“My whole world could fall apart.”</p>
<p t="2205730" d="4639">So that's sort of the fear of societal catastrophe
- the collapse of the structure.</p>
<p t="2210369" d="2940">And then the other fear is often, “Oh my
god.</p>
<p t="2213309" d="1411">I could be dying of a heart attack.”</p>
<p t="2214720" d="4899">And so what happens to people who start to
develop panic disorder is that they end up</p>
<p t="2219619" d="5240">going to the emergency room all the time to
be checked out by cardiologists, and the cardiologists</p>
<p t="2224859" d="3871">are used to this, and they generally check
people up quite extensively but most of the</p>
<p t="2228730" d="3490">time if there's something up with your heart,
there's nothing wrong.</p>
<p t="2232220" d="11740">But there could be, and so then the sort of…
what happens is the person who is developed</p>
<p t="2243960" d="5770">agoraphobia starts thinking perhaps about
what would happen if her husband died or if</p>
<p t="2249730" d="3839">they got divorced, and then she starts thinking
about the fact that well she doesn't really</p>
<p t="2253569" d="3561">know what she'd do, and she doesn't really
know how to take care of a bunch of things</p>
<p t="2257130" d="3570">and how she might take care of the finances
and so forth.</p>
<p t="2260700" d="8570">And so, she has no real place to turn, and
so then she makes the fatal mistake.</p>
<p t="2269270" d="3930">She goes out and she starts to panic, and
then she goes home.</p>
<p t="2273200" d="1270">That's not good.</p>
<p t="2274470" d="6250">So if you ever develop severe anxiety, the
one thing you don't want to do is avoid because</p>
<p t="2280720" d="4571">of it because as soon as you avoid because
of it, it gets worse, and the reason for that</p>
<p t="2285291" d="5459">is imagine her anxiety systems are trying
to figure out how afraid she should be, and</p>
<p t="2290750" d="3730">it ranges from panic stricken to none.</p>
<p t="2294480" d="6470">Well, the anxiety systems have all sorts of
sources of input because they're trying to</p>
<p t="2300950" d="5470">calculate a very difficult problem because,
you know, when this thing flickered, one of</p>
<p t="2306420" d="5220">the things that everyone does is look around,
and the reason you do that - it's called</p>
<p t="2311640" d="1000">referencing.</p>
<p t="2312640" d="1000">Social referencing.</p>
<p t="2313640" d="1410">It's like, “Well how upset should I be
about this?</p>
<p t="2315050" d="3789">What's going on?” and you look at everyone's
face and you see well they're upset or they're</p>
<p t="2318839" d="3781">not upset and everybody kind of comes to an
average agreement about how upsetting this</p>
<p t="2322620" d="6030">is, and we do that very, very rapidly, you
know, and we estimate how anxious we should</p>
<p t="2328650" d="7770">be by our default neuroticism, so I would
say generally speaking, if you have higher</p>
<p t="2336420" d="6389">levels of negative emotion, rather than lower
levels, what happens is you - the severity</p>
<p t="2342809" d="7760">that you estimate a given uncertain event
to exist to have is higher than the severity</p>
<p t="2350569" d="4061">someone else might estimate if they were more
emotionally stable.</p>
<p t="2354630" d="4980">And then there's another input which is well
roughly how competent do people around you</p>
<p t="2359610" d="5150">and you think you are because, you know, how
afraid you should be is actually somewhat</p>
<p t="2364760" d="2420">proportionate to how competent you are right?</p>
<p t="2367180" d="5580">I mean, if you're a well practiced hunter
and you're out in the forest, and a bear charges</p>
<p t="2372760" d="3049">you, it's like well maybe you've seen
a hundred bears and you know what to do and</p>
<p t="2375809" d="4941">it's like it's a bear and all that, but
you're not gonna run.</p>
<p t="2380750" d="4280">And so then the bear probably won't think
you're prey because the bear thinks that if</p>
<p t="2385030" d="1880">you run, that you're edible.</p>
<p t="2386910" d="5471">Now the thing that's really interesting is
that if you watch yourself run, then your</p>
<p t="2392381" d="2259">brain thinks you're edible too.</p>
<p t="2394640" d="5370">So that's another input so because - so the
anxiety system is doing this terribly difficult</p>
<p t="2400010" d="2180">calibration job which is “Okay something
happened.</p>
<p t="2402190" d="1399">How upset should I be?”</p>
<p t="2403589" d="2341">Well, how upset are other people?</p>
<p t="2405930" d="2090">What's my physiological response?</p>
<p t="2408020" d="2210">How does it compare to other times I was upset.</p>
<p t="2410230" d="1000">What are my options?</p>
<p t="2411230" d="3990">That's a good one because one of the things
the anxiety systems really wants is that it</p>
<p t="2415220" d="1990">wants you to come up with a plan.</p>
<p t="2417210" d="4340">It doesn't really care what the plan is although
you have to believe it because it's not</p>
<p t="2421550" d="4650">really a sophisticated cognitive system, it's
an alarm bell and it says, “Look, something's</p>
<p t="2426200" d="1000">up here.</p>
<p t="2427200" d="3419">You have to knit up your world again, and
put it to rest.</p>
<p t="2430619" d="3710">We need to be able to ignore everything again,”
and if you can't do that, that thing will</p>
<p t="2434329" d="1081">just go off forever.</p>
<p t="2435410" d="3850">That's what happens at least in part to
people who have post traumatic stress disorder.</p>
<p t="2439260" d="4930">They're soldiers, you know, and maybe they've
gone out in battle and they've watched themself</p>
<p t="2444190" d="4690">do terrible things cause that's actually one
of the most common precedents of post traumatic</p>
<p t="2448880" d="7260">stress disorder, and they have no idea how
to represent that in their hierarchical world</p>
<p t="2456140" d="3890">model, you know, because part of your world
model, a huge part of it - the “What is”</p>
<p t="2460030" d="2250">part, you know, is who you are.</p>
<p t="2462280" d="3839">Well it's like you might find out that you're
not who you think you are.</p>
<p t="2466119" d="2980">You aren't even who you think you are a little
tiny bit.</p>
<p t="2469099" d="6260">Like there's corners and nooks and whole unexplored
rooms inside of you that contain things that</p>
<p t="2475359" d="4211">if they ever come out, you're done.</p>
<p t="2479570" d="1430">You don't know what to do with it, you know.</p>
<p t="2481000" d="4150">And if you've dealt with something who has
post traumatic stress disorder, it's very</p>
<p t="2485150" d="5010">frequently the case you have to - they have
to learn a philosophy of good and evil in</p>
<p t="2490160" d="1010">order to recover.</p>
<p t="2491170" d="3919">It has to be sophisticated because they've
seen these terrible, destructive forces at</p>
<p t="2495089" d="7811">work and their whole world model is just not
handling it.</p>
<p t="2502900" d="6669">So what happens is that the agoraphobic person
runs, and then their anxiety system says well</p>
<p t="2509569" d="5770">what's chasing them is obviously a flesh eating
predator, and you know it isn't exactly that</p>
<p t="2515339" d="2361">it thinks that although it might have dreams
like that.</p>
<p t="2517700" d="6800">They could easily have dreams of being pursued,
but it's the same system like the system</p>
<p t="2524500" d="4700">that we use to run away from things that ate
us when we were thirty pounds is the same</p>
<p t="2529200" d="4740">system that we now use to process relatively
abstract threats.</p>
<p t="2533940" d="1349">And why wouldn't it be?</p>
<p t="2535289" d="3131">Look, as far as I'm concerned, this isn't
even a hypothesis.</p>
<p t="2538420" d="2949">It's like we know evolution is conservative.</p>
<p t="2541369" d="2301">Everything builds on what was there before.</p>
<p t="2543670" d="5119">So, what else are you gonna use when you're
threatened by some abstract threat except</p>
<p t="2548789" d="4381">the system that you used to use when you were
threatened by a crocodile?</p>
<p t="2553170" d="8020">So, it's only… it's exactly the way
it works.</p>
<p t="2561190" d="6149">So then you know, she ends up - question?</p>
<p t="2567339" d="12151">Oh no, no you have to run from something.</p>
<p t="2579490" d="1349">Just running, that's irrelevant.</p>
<p t="2580839" d="1801">It's a huge difference.</p>
<p t="2582640" d="3290">If you're running towards something, that's
way different than if you're running away</p>
<p t="2585930" d="1000">from something.</p>
<p t="2586930" d="1600">Say you're like anxious about an assignment
and you go for a run and come back more clear</p>
<p t="2588530" d="2289">headed to work on it.</p>
<p t="2590819" d="2211">You're not running from the assignment.</p>
<p t="2593030" d="1141">Are you not?</p>
<p t="2594171" d="2648">No, you're just going out for a run, and that's
okay.</p>
<p t="2596819" d="1240">Look, let me give you an example.</p>
<p t="2598059" d="1000">Well it's a good question.</p>
<p t="2599059" d="2361">Let me give you an example.</p>
<p t="2601420" d="7050">If you take a stressor of a certain magnitude
and you are interested in the response of</p>
<p t="2608470" d="7210">two groups, if you let one group handle the
stressor voluntarily, and you force the other</p>
<p t="2615680" d="5250">group to handle the stressor involuntarily,
the second group will produce much more cortisol</p>
<p t="2620930" d="8020">which is the primary stress hormone, and so
voluntary approach - you use different psychophysiological</p>
<p t="2628950" d="4450">systems for voluntary approach than you do
for retreat and you know, part of what you're</p>
<p t="2633400" d="4140">doing when you're training someone or when
you're using exposure with someone who has</p>
<p t="2637540" d="7539">agoraphobia is that you're teaching them that
the voluntary approach system, if you activate</p>
<p t="2645079" d="2421">that, that's a very good way of coping with
anxiety.</p>
<p t="2647500" d="3520">Now they don't know that, in this situation
that we're describing, because they're not</p>
<p t="2651020" d="1000">autonomous.</p>
<p t="2652020" d="3140">They haven't ever learned to rely on that
system.</p>
<p t="2655160" d="5790">So you know, if you're faced with a threat,
there's a variety of things you can do.</p>
<p t="2660950" d="4370">You can just panic, but panic is usually distress,
you know.</p>
<p t="2665320" d="2180">Maybe a child sort of does that when it starts
crying.</p>
<p t="2667500" d="2260">And what happens when the child starts crying?</p>
<p t="2669760" d="2349">Well, someone comes to its rescue right.</p>
<p t="2672109" d="4801">So one of the things you can do is emit distress
cries and social resources will come and be</p>
<p t="2676910" d="2860">gathered around you and maybe that'll solve
the problem.</p>
<p t="2679770" d="5839">But that doesn't work when your heart is palpitating
because who's gonna fix that?</p>
<p t="2685609" d="1431">Well often these people...</p>
<p t="2687040" d="6091">If you look deeply into their thoughts maybe
they're afraid to ride a subway and the actual</p>
<p t="2693131" d="3599">reason they're afraid to ride the subway is
they think, “Well what if the subway gets</p>
<p t="2696730" d="6220">stopped between stations and I'm trapped
on here and I have a heart attack and I can't</p>
<p t="2702950" d="1649">get to the hospital?”</p>
<p t="2704599" d="5361">So that hospital thing is running around in
their head all the time because their default</p>
<p t="2709960" d="4760">strategy for dealing with threat is to seek
authority, and one of the things that often</p>
<p t="2714720" d="5879">sets people up for developing agoraphobia
is that the authority that they rely on suddenly</p>
<p t="2720599" d="2201">becomes uncertain for one reason or another.</p>
<p t="2722800" d="4730">Maybe the person is going to leave and they're
isolated or maybe the person, like if it's</p>
<p t="2727530" d="2540">a husband say, the person is - what good is
that?</p>
<p t="2730070" d="2180">If your heart's palpitating and you're gonna
have a heart attack?</p>
<p t="2732250" d="3650">It's a problem that can't be solved that
way.</p>
<p t="2735900" d="4200">You know, people might think about that as
a whole existential crisis, and it is an existential</p>
<p t="2740100" d="1000">crisis.</p>
<p t="2741100" d="3440">It's like you're coming face to face with
your own mortality, and that's certainly the</p>
<p t="2744540" d="5740">case if you're going through menopause at
the same time because that's another, you</p>
<p t="2750280" d="5620">know, profound life shift that indicates you're
sort of halfway done, or two-thirds of the</p>
<p t="2755900" d="1160">way done.</p>
<p t="2757060" d="1000">Something like that.</p>
<p t="2758060" d="3759">And that's of course, you know, you can think
about that in terms of terror management as</p>
<p t="2761819" d="1000">well.</p>
<p t="2762819" d="3191">So it is an existential crisis, and the question
is how do you deal with it?</p>
<p t="2766010" d="6060">And the answer to that generally is by becoming
a lot tougher than you are, and the way you</p>
<p t="2772070" d="6630">help people do that is teach them there are
certain dangerous situations they can approach</p>
<p t="2778700" d="1730">and they can approach them.</p>
<p t="2780430" d="7230">And generally, people learn this quite quickly,
you know, and so the psychoanalysts believe</p>
<p t="2787660" d="5379">that if you just - this was their early criticisms
of behavioral exposure was that, you know,</p>
<p t="2793039" d="6141">if you expose someone who's afraid, say,
just to an elevator that that will help their</p>
<p t="2799180" d="5210">other fears or maybe the fear will be substituted
somewhere else because it's just symptomatic.</p>
<p t="2804390" d="1140">But that didn't work.</p>
<p t="2805530" d="5641">It's not right, and it's because when
you expose someone to an elevator, you're</p>
<p t="2811171" d="1649">not exposing them to an elevator.</p>
<p t="2812820" d="4640">If they're afraid of that elevator, you're
exposing them to their own death.</p>
<p t="2817460" d="6360">So the elevator, you could say well the reason
behavioral exposure works - and it generalizes</p>
<p t="2823820" d="5840">- is because it's not easy to specify what
the stimulus is.</p>
<p t="2829660" d="3300">I mean, when I'm in front of an elevator,
it's an elevator.</p>
<p t="2832960" d="5190">When someone with agoraphobia is in front
of an elevator, it's not an elevator.</p>
<p t="2838150" d="1270">That's the problem.</p>
<p t="2839420" d="3020">If it was just an elevator, they'd just
get on it and away they go.</p>
<p t="2842440" d="3720">So you know, I had one client who was afraid
of elevators and the elevator opened up and</p>
<p t="2846160" d="2280">she said, “That's a tomb.”</p>
<p t="2848440" d="4210">And it was just an immediate response, you
know, but you could say well that was the</p>
<p t="2852650" d="6449">symbolic representation that came to mind,
but you could also say that well there are</p>
<p t="2859099" d="3700">similarities between an elevator and a tomb,
and you can get trapped inside an elevator</p>
<p t="2862799" d="4611">and you could get trapped inside an elevator
and die in which case it would be a tomb,</p>
<p t="2867410" d="4080">and the logical conclusion from that is that
everything could be a tomb.</p>
<p t="2871490" d="2990">So you might think, “Well the stimulus isn't
tomb.”</p>
<p t="2874480" d="1220">Like yeah, yeah.</p>
<p t="2875700" d="1000">Wrong.</p>
<p t="2876700" d="1030">It can be tomb.</p>
<p t="2877730" d="7160">It's unlikely, but then you might also ask
yourself this.</p>
<p t="2884890" d="4760">If the chance that you're going to die somewhere
is a hundred thousand to one, should you be</p>
<p t="2889650" d="1000">upset?</p>
<p t="2890650" d="6169">And well the answer to that is dying is of
infinite magnitude, and if you multiply one</p>
<p t="2896819" d="4861">and a hundred thousand by infinite magnitude,
you get a very very large number.</p>
<p t="2901680" d="3730">And so one of the things that makes you wonder
is why the hell are people terrified out of</p>
<p t="2905410" d="1970">their skin all the time?</p>
<p t="2907380" d="5520">That is a very good question because by no
means obvious that people aren't, and I</p>
<p t="2912900" d="4940">actually think - I often think that the mystery
with a condition like agoraphobia isn't that</p>
<p t="2917840" d="1279">some people have agoraphobia.</p>
<p t="2919119" d="4081">It's that everyone doesn't have it all the
time.</p>
<p t="2923200" d="4200">So because - and you know the terror management
people talk about this too is that because</p>
<p t="2927400" d="5389">we're always confronting our own mortality
and a world of infinite complexity, why aren't</p>
<p t="2932789" d="2611">we constantly in a state of panic?</p>
<p t="2935400" d="1460">And you know, now and then you realize that.</p>
<p t="2936860" d="2280">You think jeez, why aren't we in a state of
panic?</p>
<p t="2939140" d="10740">It's a very unsettling realization, and
why it isn't more common, that's a very,</p>
<p t="2949880" d="5510">very complicated question.</p>
<p t="2955390" d="6290">I think a lot of it is that we imitate other
people, and so a lot of our faith, let's</p>
<p t="2961680" d="5590">say, in the stability of our lives and the
utility and the meaning of our lives is actually</p>
<p t="2967270" d="4940">instantiated at an embodied level where it's
not subject to criticism.</p>
<p t="2972210" d="3860">So for example, I'll give you an example.</p>
<p t="2976070" d="6010">There's a child two years old and there's
a mother, and they're together in the kitchen,</p>
<p t="2982080" d="2660">and a mouse runs across the floor.</p>
<p t="2984740" d="5050">Okay, the child orients towards the mouse,
watches it zip across, and then looks at his</p>
<p t="2989790" d="1739">mother or her mother.</p>
<p t="2991529" d="1000">Why?</p>
<p t="2992529" d="7492">Well because something anomalous has occurred,
the significance of which is unstated, and</p>
<p t="3000021" d="1000">it's arousing.</p>
<p t="3001021" d="3699">It's like wow look at that, you know, you
can be startled like that like “Wow look</p>
<p t="3004720" d="1000">at that!”</p>
<p t="3005720" d="1000">Zip!</p>
<p t="3006720" d="2340">Well then you think, what does mum think of
that?</p>
<p t="3009060" d="2861">And mum is thinking, “Oh that's a mouse,”
maybe she'll tell you about mice or maybe</p>
<p t="3011921" d="2499">she'll set a trap or something.</p>
<p t="3014420" d="5449">But she's calm, and so the child imitates
that, and then you know, they've got this</p>
<p t="3019869" d="4710">sense in their body that human beings can
deal with mice and that's no problem.</p>
<p t="3024579" d="3720">The alternative is that the mouse comes up
and the mother jumps up on the table and starts</p>
<p t="3028299" d="1000">screaming.</p>
<p t="3029299" d="4421">It's like well, you could be sure what's
the child gonna do in a situation like that</p>
<p t="3033720" d="3770">is burst into tears and be extraordinarily
upset.</p>
<p t="3037490" d="5180">So a lot of what we're doing when we're
little, and we watch people around us is that</p>
<p t="3042670" d="2030">they model being calm.</p>
<p t="3044700" d="7079">So we just adopt the implicit assumption - it's
an embodied assumption - that you can be calm</p>
<p t="3051779" d="5010">in these circumstances and luckily enough,
we generally don't - that generally doesn't</p>
<p t="3056789" d="5481">come unglued, but you can unglue it even by
deep thought, and that happens to people quite</p>
<p t="3062270" d="1000">frequently.</p>
<p t="3063270" d="1529">That would be an existential catastrophe.</p>
<p t="3064799" d="11510">Alright so, let me show you something else
here.</p>
<p t="3076309" d="8211">So, same idea.</p>
<p t="3084520" d="2120">Now, this is changed a little bit.</p>
<p t="3086640" d="3800">So you're going from point A to point B, and
what can happen?</p>
<p t="3090440" d="4369">Well you can encounter tools and you can encounter
obstacles and you can zero almost everything</p>
<p t="3094809" d="1121">out.</p>
<p t="3095930" d="2030">But you can look at it this way too.</p>
<p t="3097960" d="3110">When you're moving forward, you can encounter
what you predict.</p>
<p t="3101070" d="4450">That should really be desired rather than
predictiveness in the old diagram, or you</p>
<p t="3105520" d="6960">can encounter something that you didn't predict
or desire, and if you encounter something</p>
<p t="3112480" d="3879">that you predict and desire, then you have
positive emotion and we know why that is.</p>
<p t="3116359" d="3190">You're getting to where you want to go and
it validates the whole structure.</p>
<p t="3119549" d="3401">But then, you run into something unpredicted.</p>
<p t="3122950" d="7020">Well then, you get - that's a threat and
you get anxious.</p>
<p t="3129970" d="3149">Well you also get exploratory.</p>
<p t="3133119" d="4250">So then you might say well, how anxious do
you get and how exploratory do you get, and</p>
<p t="3137369" d="6401">I would say it's proportional - imagine
the hierarchy again.</p>
<p t="3143770" d="7839">If you feel that it's just an inconvenience
that you can make a mild alteration and direct</p>
<p t="3151609" d="5651">action and go over, you'll be mildly inconvenienced
and maybe you'll be a bit curious, but what</p>
<p t="3157260" d="5930">happens is that as your suspicion that the
error is occurring at higher and higher and</p>
<p t="3163190" d="5890">broader and broader levels in the hierarchy,
the probability that you're going to be anxious,</p>
<p t="3169080" d="5490">and quite anxious compared to exploratory
at least initially, starts to mount.</p>
<p t="3174570" d="4230">So, and then, all those other factors also
play a role.</p>
<p t="3178800" d="4880">You know, your social status, your neuroticism,
your sense of self competence.</p>
<p t="3183680" d="6510">How much you've explored all those other things
is a very complicated thing to address, and</p>
<p t="3190190" d="2710">so alright.</p>
<p t="3192900" d="5379">So then you're going to concentrate on what
happens if you experience an unpredicted outcome</p>
<p t="3198279" d="2641">because here's the complicated question.</p>
<p t="3200920" d="4970">If you experience an unpredicted outcome,
then you have a weird problem.</p>
<p t="3205890" d="4919">The problem is that you have to figure out
what to do about something that you don't</p>
<p t="3210809" d="8201">know what to do about, and that's a big
problem.</p>
<p t="3219010" d="11049">So...let's start with this one.</p>
<p t="3230059" d="4271">Alright so, you're going.</p>
<p t="3234330" d="1430">You're in the top left hand corner.</p>
<p t="3235760" d="5880">You're in this little frame, and you're going
from point A to point B, and you encounter</p>
<p t="3241640" d="5950">- I'm calling it now - an anomaly, and anomaly
is something that shouldn't be according to</p>
<p t="3247590" d="2980">your model of the world.</p>
<p t="3250570" d="5680">Now, what that does is it destabilizes that
model at some level of resolution.</p>
<p t="3256250" d="7049">Now what we're assuming here is that this
is a relatively high order disruption.</p>
<p t="3263299" d="2520">Okay so I can give you some examples of that.</p>
<p t="3265819" d="5201">The heart palpitation example was a good one
cause that'll kind of unglue you.</p>
<p t="3271020" d="3240">Maybe you take your child to the hospital
because they have a minor illness and you</p>
<p t="3274260" d="3760">find out that they don't have a minor illness,
they have a major illness, or you find that</p>
<p t="3278020" d="4730">out about yourself or you find that about
your partner, or maybe the stock market crashes</p>
<p t="3282750" d="4980">or you have a car accident or you write the
MCAT and you end up in the twenty fifth percentile</p>
<p t="3287730" d="4950">like the quarter of the people who take it
do, and then all of a sudden bang.</p>
<p t="3292680" d="3251">You're not where you thought you were, and
you're not going to where you thought where</p>
<p t="3295931" d="5979">you were going and you don't know what the
hell's going on, and that can be as we said,</p>
<p t="3301910" d="1110">a small revolution.</p>
<p t="3303020" d="5900">You just have to make a detour around it,
or it can just sucker punch you, and that's</p>
<p t="3308920" d="4409">as far as I've been able to determine, that's
Alice down the rabbit hole.</p>
<p t="3313329" d="3601">That's a descent to the underworld, and what's
down in the underworld?</p>
<p t="3316930" d="5659">Well partly what's down - everything is
down there in the underworld, and the reason</p>
<p t="3322589" d="7161">for that...it's very complicated but part
of the reason is that when things fall apart,</p>
<p t="3329750" d="5201">you don't get to ignore things anymore because
you had this model that told you what was</p>
<p t="3334951" d="4059">relevant in the world and what wasn't and
the real important part of that model was</p>
<p t="3339010" d="5930">that it told you what wasn't relevant, and
then all of a sudden something pops up and</p>
<p t="3344940" d="1000">takes you down.</p>
<p t="3345940" d="2480">It's like everything's relevant.</p>
<p t="3348420" d="5080">Everything's potentially relevant, and that's
terribly stressful because everything is should</p>
<p t="3353500" d="1000">I be angry?</p>
<p t="3354500" d="1059">Should I be upset?</p>
<p t="3355559" d="1000">Should I cry?</p>
<p t="3356559" d="1000">Should I get divorced?</p>
<p t="3357559" d="1000">Should I run away?</p>
<p t="3358559" d="1000">Should I commit suicide?</p>
<p t="3359559" d="2381">It's like how am I come up with a new plan?</p>
<p t="3361940" d="1000">Where am I gonna get money?</p>
<p t="3362940" d="1080">Who's going to help me?</p>
<p t="3364020" d="2279">What's my future going to look like?</p>
<p t="3366299" d="1270">What does my past look like?</p>
<p t="3367569" d="1050">What am I going to do today?</p>
<p t="3368619" d="1000">What am I gonna do tomorrow?</p>
<p t="3369619" d="5101">It's like all of these things come up and
some of that weirdness in the external world,</p>
<p t="3374720" d="4609">and that would be well, let's say that you
discover that your child's sick, and let's</p>
<p t="3379329" d="2861">say the doctors really don't know what to
do about it.</p>
<p t="3382190" d="5700">Okay so, you've just been handed a problem
of infinite complexity, and a problem of infinite</p>
<p t="3387890" d="4689">complexity is like a journey through a maze
that has no end.</p>
<p t="3392579" d="4631">It's a branching maze, and so what you'll
find yourself doing, for example, is going</p>
<p t="3397210" d="5069">on the internet and spending hundreds of hours
- if you've got a research oriented mind - hundreds</p>
<p t="3402279" d="4800">of hours looking up every single research
article you can possibly find on this condition,</p>
<p t="3407079" d="4981">and that'll range from like the farthest out
new age ideas to the most cutting edge science,</p>
<p t="3412060" d="1140">if you can handle that.</p>
<p t="3413200" d="2409">So, you know, good luck with that.</p>
<p t="3415609" d="6531">That's an infinite search, and then that's
not the only problem because - so the fact</p>
<p t="3422140" d="3679">that it's an infinite search is very bad
for you because there's no way you can calculate</p>
<p t="3425819" d="3811">how much time and energy it's going to take
you to solve the problem.</p>
<p t="3429630" d="3439">So, that's stressful.</p>
<p t="3433069" d="1151">Why?</p>
<p t="3434220" d="1172">Well obviously it's stressful.</p>
<p t="3435392" d="6188">It means you have an infinite journey towards
an uncertain goal, and you can't even handle</p>
<p t="3441580" d="1750">that you know.</p>
<p t="3443330" d="4219">I mean, your journeys have to be such that
they're self sustaining right?</p>
<p t="3447549" d="5351">I mean, generally speaking, when you're on
a journey of some sort, you have to obtain</p>
<p t="3452900" d="7969">as much matter and energy as the journey costs,
and maybe a bit more because you're storing</p>
<p t="3460869" d="1591">some up for the future.</p>
<p t="3462460" d="7139">But if you've got this path of infinite complexity
laying out in front of you, it's like your</p>
<p t="3469599" d="5651">body can't calibrate that and so what it does
is it throws you into emergency reaction mode</p>
<p t="3475250" d="7160">and emergency reaction mode is prepare for
everything, and that's not good.</p>
<p t="3482410" d="7760">And so, down there in the underworld the world
itself turns into a maze of infinite complexity,</p>
<p t="3490170" d="7429">but you turn into a mass of competing models,
and a lot of them are based in very low level</p>
<p t="3497599" d="1000">motivation.</p>
<p t="3498599" d="1000">You're going to be angry.</p>
<p t="3499599" d="1000">That's for sure.</p>
<p t="3500599" d="3291">You might be angry god only knows for how
long, you know, if it's a particularly nasty</p>
<p t="3503890" d="1000">disease.</p>
<p t="3504890" d="5150">You might be angry for the rest of your life,
and you know, you can be angry in a small</p>
<p t="3510040" d="6249">way and accept fate, or you can be so angry
that it completely consumes you and you're</p>
<p t="3516289" d="5451">out for revenge against being itself, and
that happens to people, and that's only one</p>
<p t="3521740" d="6670">of the emotions and motivational states that
are going to be hyper activated by the response,</p>
<p t="3528410" d="8679">and so what happens is that your system collapses
into the underlying basic motivational states</p>
<p t="3537089" d="6301">and so you're anxious, and afraid, and angry,
and exploratory, and upset, and all of these</p>
<p t="3543390" d="4490">things all at the same time, and that is your
reaction to the unknown.</p>
<p t="3547880" d="5729">Your reaction to the unknown is stop, because
you aren't where you thought you were, and</p>
<p t="3553609" d="5240">then the next thing is prepare for anything,
and the way you prepare for anything is by</p>
<p t="3558849" d="3071">getting ready to do whatever it is that you
can do.</p>
<p t="3561920" d="6710">So, I kinda think about it as you're in
a car and you've got the gas pedal pushed</p>
<p t="3568630" d="4810">right to the metal and you've got the break
on at the same time, so the car's roaring</p>
<p t="3573440" d="4970">away but - and you know if you take the foot
off the break, man it's gonna move, but</p>
<p t="3578410" d="2770">your foot isn't off the break because you
don't know where to go but you're still running</p>
<p t="3581180" d="4800">at full tilt, and that's not psychological
exactly right.</p>
<p t="3585980" d="6390">It's psychophysiological because you're
an energy and material burning system, and</p>
<p t="3592370" d="4530">if you crank yourself up into high gear then
you're going to be burning a lot more energy</p>
<p t="3596900" d="4500">and material, and what happens to people is
that well one of the things that happens is</p>
<p t="3601400" d="5100">that you'll shut your immune system off
because if you're being - because it's costly</p>
<p t="3606500" d="3980">- if you're being chased by a tiger, who the
hell cares if you get the flu in two weeks.</p>
<p t="3610480" d="2230">It's like shut that thing off.</p>
<p t="3612710" d="5069">Everything that has to do with long term survival,
even your ability to think into the long term,</p>
<p t="3617779" d="7941">is going to be shut off because your ability
to think in the long term failed, and so you</p>
<p t="3625720" d="6290">default back down to instantaneous impulsive
modes of actions, and it's the right thing</p>
<p t="3632010" d="1000">to do.</p>
<p t="3633010" d="4279">You might think, “Oh well this is a hell
of a time to have a cloudy mind,” but - and</p>
<p t="3637289" d="4520">sometimes that's the case - but you're wired
up.</p>
<p t="3641809" d="3300">You're trying to solve this impossible problem
which is what the hell do you do when you</p>
<p t="3645109" d="6821">don't know what to do, and the only answer
to that is prepare for everything because</p>
<p t="3651930" d="3250">you're going to gather some more information
and that might tell you what needs to be done</p>
<p t="3655180" d="3159">next but you have no idea how fast it's
going to have to be done.</p>
<p t="3658339" d="6421">It might be like you need to do this right
now or you don't get it don't at all.</p>
<p t="3664760" d="4089">So then you're down there in the underworld
where all the, you know, great motivational</p>
<p t="3668849" d="4811">beasts lurk and where there's an infinite
path in front of you that's - and maybe you</p>
<p t="3673660" d="3149">don't get out, and that's the thing too.</p>
<p t="3676809" d="7171">The thing is that this isn't psychological,
and one of the real problems with modern clinical</p>
<p t="3683980" d="6970">psychology and modern psychiatry - just conceptually
- is that people automatically assume that</p>
<p t="3690950" d="6550">if you have a problem, like if you're depressed
and unhappy and anxious, well then that's</p>
<p t="3697500" d="1390">a mental problem.</p>
<p t="3698890" d="1469">It's a psychological problem.</p>
<p t="3700359" d="7571">It's like it's a problem insofar as it's
not pleasant, but what if you're in a horrible</p>
<p t="3707930" d="1129">situation?</p>
<p t="3709059" d="3250">Well you know, the cognitive people would
say, “Well you know, you just have to reconstrue</p>
<p t="3712309" d="1000">it.”</p>
<p t="3713309" d="3721">It's like yeah if you can reconstrue it
man, you're not in a horrible situation, you</p>
<p t="3717030" d="4249">know, and one of the things you see with the
cognitive behaviorists for example is when</p>
<p t="3721279" d="3671">they assess depression, they use the Beck
Depression Inventory, and I've given the</p>
<p t="3724950" d="7409">Beck Depression Inventory to hundreds of people,
and their criteria for when you should be</p>
<p t="3732359" d="5760">an outpatient in a psychiatric ward is probably
the level of depression that one-third of</p>
<p t="3738119" d="5170">you experienced the first year that you were
in university cause I've given this instrument</p>
<p t="3743289" d="4591">to lots of university students and one-third
of them, at least in the first year, meet</p>
<p t="3747880" d="2430">criteria for hospitalization with the Beck.</p>
<p t="3750310" d="7700">So the way that cognitive behaviorist people
- what do you call - evade this issue is that</p>
<p t="3758010" d="3799">they just set their diagnostic instrument
so low that the people that they described</p>
<p t="3761809" d="5341">as depressed actually don't have a problem,
you know, so I think the cutoff for outpatient</p>
<p t="3767150" d="1240">is fifteen.</p>
<p t="3768390" d="3979">You know, you're not happy when you get a
fifteen on the Beck, but if you're depressed</p>
<p t="3772369" d="1220">you get a sixty.</p>
<p t="3773589" d="4440">It's like you're depressed, and then you
talk to someone like that and you find out</p>
<p t="3778029" d="4611">well maybe you're depressed or maybe you just
have a terrible life, and the terrible life</p>
<p t="3782640" d="3709">is - and good luck reconstruing that man.</p>
<p t="3786349" d="6621">So you're not very bright, for example, and
that's a big problem so maybe you have an</p>
<p t="3792970" d="1830">IQ of 85, or maybe you have an IQ of 80.</p>
<p t="3794800" d="2770">It's like good luck finding a job, and if
you do find one, it's not gonna pay, and</p>
<p t="3797570" d="6400">it's not going to be stable, and you're
not going to get good hours, and so then well</p>
<p t="3803970" d="5790">you know your only friend is crazy, and then
your family is like distorted and twisted</p>
<p t="3809760" d="4070">up beyond belief so maybe you know, your mother
is chronic alcoholic with dementia.</p>
<p t="3813830" d="7160">That'd be a nice touch, and you know, maybe
your friends aren't only not very good for</p>
<p t="3820990" d="4629">you, they're actively bad for you because
you've fallen in with some bloody psychopaths,</p>
<p t="3825619" d="4631">and because you're not particularly bright,
they can get your money every time you get</p>
<p t="3830250" d="4980">your support check, your unemployment check
or something like that.</p>
<p t="3835230" d="4230">Well you know, you get someone like that in
your practice and you think, well they're</p>
<p t="3839460" d="1000">unhappy.</p>
<p t="3840460" d="1619">Are they depressed?</p>
<p t="3842079" d="1301">Well, no.</p>
<p t="3843380" d="1550">They're in the underworld.</p>
<p t="3844930" d="2189">It's not the same thing.</p>
<p t="3847119" d="1980">Here's depressed.</p>
<p t="3849099" d="2371">Depressed is someone comes in.</p>
<p t="3851470" d="1860">They're reasonably well educated.</p>
<p t="3853330" d="3810">They have a job, and when you ask them about
the job, they say, “Well you know, I used</p>
<p t="3857140" d="3879">to like my job” or maybe “I even do like
my job but I just don't find that I'm motivated</p>
<p t="3861019" d="2361">right now, and I can't understand why.”</p>
<p t="3863380" d="4040">Then you ask them about their marriage and
they say, “Well you know, I have a good</p>
<p t="3867420" d="2240">marriage” and then you ask them about their
family and they say, “Well, I've got the</p>
<p t="3869660" d="3320">average number of family problems but it's,
you know, all things considered it's not</p>
<p t="3872980" d="1319">too bad.”</p>
<p t="3874299" d="4551">And so, and then they don't have a drug or
alcohol problem, but they score like thirty</p>
<p t="3878850" d="1000">on the Beck.</p>
<p t="3879850" d="2150">You think, “Hey, you can take some antidepressants.</p>
<p t="3882000" d="1170">You're depressed.</p>
<p t="3883170" d="1790">You don't have a terrible life.”</p>
<p t="3884960" d="1000">You know, and they know that.</p>
<p t="3885960" d="4329">They often don't have any real cognitive symptoms
either, although they might be reacting more</p>
<p t="3890289" d="2730">negatively to some of the negative things
that are happening.</p>
<p t="3893019" d="4191">With those people, something's gone astray,
you know, maybe their sleep is upset.</p>
<p t="3897210" d="1520">That's often the case.</p>
<p t="3898730" d="7460">So and what they're suffering from is disequilibrium
of sleep wake rhythms, so it's gone out</p>
<p t="3906190" d="1000">of whack.</p>
<p t="3907190" d="3440">So you straighten up their sleep and they're
better, or sometimes they need antidepressants,</p>
<p t="3910630" d="5159">but for the first person, like antidepressants
might take the edge off and maybe not too,</p>
<p t="3915789" d="2030">but - and what are you gonna do?</p>
<p t="3917819" d="2361">You're gonna get the person to reconstrue?</p>
<p t="3920180" d="3970">That assumes they have options, you know,
and the problem with educated smart people</p>
<p t="3924150" d="2419">is they think everybody has options because
they do.</p>
<p t="3926569" d="1881">It's like no, that's not right.</p>
<p t="3928450" d="3360">Some people have - some people have no options.</p>
<p t="3931810" d="4940">They're like trapped in a corner, and no matter
how hard you try, you cannot get them out</p>
<p t="3936750" d="1619">of the corner.</p>
<p t="3938369" d="3051">Sometimes it takes a virtual miracle before
that can happen.</p>
<p t="3941420" d="2800">So the thing about the underworld is that
it's a real place.</p>
<p t="3944220" d="6670">It's a real place, and - depending of course
on how you define place, but that's exactly</p>
<p t="3950890" d="1000">the issue.</p>
<p t="3951890" d="2159">How should you define place?</p>
<p t="3954049" d="6361">Well, I would say for the sake of argument
that you might as well define it two ways.</p>
<p t="3960410" d="4380">You might as well use the standard Newtonian
view, you know, that the world's made out</p>
<p t="3964790" d="5390">of inanimate material entities, arrayed in
a certain manner, because that's a very useful</p>
<p t="3970180" d="1800">approach to many problems.</p>
<p t="3971980" d="4450">But then there's another perspective which
is no, no, no, the meanings that array themselves</p>
<p t="3976430" d="2480">in front of you in the world - those are real.</p>
<p t="3978910" d="5030">And you know, I would also say - I'll just
mention this very briefly.</p>
<p t="3983940" d="11060">It's something the idea I've been working
on for a long time is that there's an implication</p>
<p t="3995000" d="7310">of Darwinian theory, and the implication is
that - we talked about this a little bit - the</p>
<p t="4002310" d="8199">environment is very complex and it's transforming
unpredictably, and so what that means is you</p>
<p t="4010509" d="2221">can never be right about the environment.</p>
<p t="4012730" d="2869">So right, correct is out of reach.</p>
<p t="4015599" d="6691">The best you can do is come to partial - you
can partially accommodate it, and so you'd</p>
<p t="4022290" d="2279">say okay well how have we partially accommodated
it?</p>
<p t="4024569" d="1101">Okay so here we are.</p>
<p t="4025670" d="3820">We've been evolving for three and a half
billion years, given it our best shot, and</p>
<p t="4029490" d="5510">here we have these bodies, and they're out
solution to the problems posed by the transforming</p>
<p t="4035000" d="3130">environment, and you might say, “Well how
good a solution are those?”</p>
<p t="4038130" d="2159">Well, you've got seventy years.</p>
<p t="4040289" d="4520">It's the best we've been able to manage
in three and a half billion years is to generate</p>
<p t="4044809" d="4250">up a biological platform that has enough flexibility
to keep up with the environment for about</p>
<p t="4049059" d="2030">75 years.</p>
<p t="4051089" d="4371">So then you think, so there's no final answer
to the problem the environment presents.</p>
<p t="4055460" d="5059">There isn't, and it's because it actually
changes unpredictably.</p>
<p t="4060519" d="2350">So there's no way of being right.</p>
<p t="4062869" d="2490">Now then you might say, well what does right
mean?</p>
<p t="4065359" d="5601">Well, from the Darwinian perspective, from
some sense there's no other right than that</p>
<p t="4070960" d="3680">you're alive and you're likely to reproduce.</p>
<p t="4074640" d="1699">That's the best you ever get.</p>
<p t="4076339" d="4711">Okay so let's say that's your pragmatic
definition of right.</p>
<p t="4081050" d="5759">Well then what that means is if that is right,
as far as right can be determined, as far</p>
<p t="4086809" d="9351">as being human is concerned, then when you
are reacting by fleeing or freezing when something</p>
<p t="4096160" d="4970">terrible is chasing you because you perceive
it as a threat, the fact that it's a threat</p>
<p t="4101130" d="1450">is right.</p>
<p t="4102580" d="2920">It's not an overlay on reality.</p>
<p t="4105500" d="5120">It's like if you didn't perceive a predator
as a threat, then you would get eaten, and</p>
<p t="4110620" d="6460">so I think - you know, you can think of the
Darwinian world as nested inside the Newtonian</p>
<p t="4117080" d="2880">world which is how most scientists think,
but I don't believe that.</p>
<p t="4119960" d="1810">I think it's the other way around.</p>
<p t="4121770" d="5620">I think the Darwinian world is the ultimate
world in a sense, and the Newtonian world</p>
<p t="4127390" d="3230">is just a tiny subset of that and it's a
useful subset.</p>
<p t="4130620" d="1000">It's a tool.</p>
<p t="4131620" d="5950">It's useful subset, but the real world - the
Darwin takes precedence over all knowledge</p>
<p t="4137570" d="1000">structures.</p>
<p t="4138570" d="4800">That's how it looks to me, and I don't see
a way out of that argument.</p>
<p t="4143370" d="2420">So, I mean it depends to a large - Yup.</p>
<p t="4145790" d="34141">So are you saying that - cause I'm trying
to understand what you're saying.</p>
<p t="4179931" d="1000">Are you saying that like our estimations of
like the deterministic, material world is</p>
<p t="4180931" d="1000">nested in an evolutionary drive to find truth
so that we can make quick assumptions about</p>
<p t="4181931" d="1000">our environment?</p>
<p t="4182931" d="1000">Yeah, so well here's another example.</p>
<p t="4183931" d="1000">You guys can think about this for a minute
if you'd like.</p>
<p t="4184931" d="6919">So, let's say that one of the logical consequences
of pursuing science from a Newtonian perspective</p>
<p t="4191850" d="5550">is that you learn how to create - cross ebola
with smallpox which is what the KGB was trying</p>
<p t="4197400" d="1050">to do in the 1980s.</p>
<p t="4198450" d="2360">Okay, so you manage that and everyone dies.</p>
<p t="4200810" d="3420">It's like, how's that for a validation
of science?</p>
<p t="4204230" d="5050">You know, it's like - because this could
happen right?</p>
<p t="4209280" d="5790">Our technological capability which is fostered
by this particular model could easily enable</p>
<p t="4215070" d="2680">us to produce something that will wipe all
of us out.</p>
<p t="4217750" d="5490">And then well are you gonna say, “Well yeah
apart from that, it was right.”</p>
<p t="4223240" d="5780">And then I'd think it's a tricky argument
because okay let's say - but here's part of</p>
<p t="4229020" d="3050">the problem, and I also thought the same thing
about hydrogen bombs.</p>
<p t="4232070" d="5270">It's like well obviously the quantum view,
let's say, is accurate because if you follow</p>
<p t="4237340" d="1850">it you can make a hydrogen bomb.</p>
<p t="4239190" d="4780">But then you can step back from that and you
can say yeah, yeah, but to make a hydrogen</p>
<p t="4243970" d="5330">bomb or to cross ebola with smallpox, you
have to treat the matter that you're interacting</p>
<p t="4249300" d="5630">with as if it's actually separate from everything
else, and the thing is it's not actually</p>
<p t="4254930" d="1700">separate from everything else.</p>
<p t="4256630" d="2530">It's actually connected to everything else.</p>
<p t="4259160" d="4450">Now you can say, well if you treat it as if
it's separate, here's some operations</p>
<p t="4263610" d="1090">you can undertake.</p>
<p t="4264700" d="3740">You can cross ebola with smallpox, but then
you've ignored a bunch of things like maybe</p>
<p t="4268440" d="2970">that's not a good idea, and then everyone
dies.</p>
<p t="4271410" d="5100">And so the reductionism in the model which
helps it specify its target and increase its</p>
<p t="4276510" d="6440">accuracy has the corresponding negative consequence
of pretending that the context within which</p>
<p t="4282950" d="5960">these enterprises are being conducted can
be ignored and that that's actually appropriate,</p>
<p t="4288910" d="1000">and that's a big problem.</p>
<p t="4289910" d="1470">It's a big problem.</p>
<p t="4291380" d="7090">So the evolutionary framework provides the
concepts because it provides like our sense</p>
<p t="4298470" d="1000">of morality.</p>
<p t="4299470" d="1490">Well, it's not only because of what it provides
us.</p>
<p t="4300960" d="8230">I think the reason that the evolutionary perspective
has to be the one that supersedes is because</p>
<p t="4309190" d="1950">you cannot model the environment.</p>
<p t="4311140" d="1730">It's not possible.</p>
<p t="4312870" d="4710">All you can do is keep up with it, and the
only way you can keep up with it is through</p>
<p t="4317580" d="1740">Darwinian processes - random.</p>
<p t="4319320" d="4910">I mean I know it's not a complete theory,
but for the sake of argument, you have to</p>
<p t="4324230" d="6080">generate random alterations, and you know,
you can say well in principle, we can understand</p>
<p t="4330310" d="1020">everything scientifically.</p>
<p t="4331330" d="3270">It's like no, in principle, we can't.</p>
<p t="4334600" d="1710">Everything's too complex to understand.</p>
<p t="4336310" d="8080">So that's why Newtonian physics is nested
within a Darwinian perspective.</p>
<p t="4344390" d="1000">That's right.</p>
<p t="4345390" d="4530">Because it's just an estimation whereas
a Darwinian perspective, it's like it's</p>
<p t="4349920" d="1170">more in line with what's actually -
It's more in line with reality.</p>
<p t="4351090" d="1000">Yeah, whereas the Newtonian perspective comes
out of a rough estimation of what reality</p>
<p t="4352090" d="9010">is like.</p>
<p t="4361100" d="6460">Well Jung, when Jung was talking about the
origin of the scientific mindset, you know,</p>
<p t="4367560" d="3080">he traced its development back to alchemy.</p>
<p t="4370640" d="5010">Here's another reason why the scientific
mindset is necessarily nested in the mythological</p>
<p t="4375650" d="1000">mindset.</p>
<p t="4376650" d="7100">So what the alchemists were trying to do is
mess around with matter and to produce something.</p>
<p t="4383750" d="4040">They argued for centuries what this thing
was.</p>
<p t="4387790" d="6520">This philosopher's stone, and what the philosopher's
stone would enable the holder of it to do</p>
<p t="4394310" d="6350">would be to transmute elements into gold,
so that would make you rich, and it would</p>
<p t="4400660" d="8500">provide immortality and perfect health for
the person who discovered it.</p>
<p t="4409160" d="3370">Okay, now what Jung said - and we'll talk
about this.</p>
<p t="4412530" d="3630">If I have enough energy, we'll talk about
this two-thirds of the way through class because</p>
<p t="4416160" d="4080">it's so damn complicated that some years
I can't muster up enough energy to discuss</p>
<p t="4420240" d="8700">it, but Jung believed that, you know, people
have always been trying to cope with their</p>
<p t="4428940" d="1520">mortality, right, and their vulnerability.</p>
<p t="4430460" d="2000">Okay, fine, and that makes perfect sense.</p>
<p t="4432460" d="5830">So he did an analysis of Western history,
roughly speaking, and said well what happened</p>
<p t="4438290" d="5010">- there was a Christian epoch, maybe, that
lasted around 1,600 years, roughly speaking,</p>
<p t="4443300" d="8290">and there was an idea at the base of it and
the idea was that through spiritual discipline,</p>
<p t="4451590" d="6240">man could transcend suffering, but - the problem
with that was that all this suffering kept</p>
<p t="4457830" d="4600">happening, and you know, and there was some
warps in the idea, as Nietzsche pointed out</p>
<p t="4462430" d="6710">how this ceasing of suffering was only going
to happen after you die.</p>
<p t="4469140" d="5450">Okay fine, then you live forever in bliss,
but still there's like black plague and babies</p>
<p t="4474590" d="4180">dying and crops failing, and it's like it
just doesn't seem that you can just ignore</p>
<p t="4478770" d="5980">that, and so you've got 1,500 or 1,600 years
of Christianity, and you know, the whole history</p>
<p t="4484750" d="5020">of Christianity behind that grinding away
on this problem trying to produce a system</p>
<p t="4489770" d="6350">of redemption, and it doesn't work or it works
partially.</p>
<p t="4496120" d="1670">And it also ignores certain things.</p>
<p t="4497790" d="4420">So partly what it ignores, you know, one of
the presuppositions of, say, medieval Christianity</p>
<p t="4502210" d="6270">is that the world, roughly speaking, is an
evil place, and that matter is corrupt and</p>
<p t="4508480" d="1480">unworthy of attention.</p>
<p t="4509960" d="4150">Well, one of Jung's hypothesis is that if
you ignore something long enough, then it</p>
<p t="4514110" d="3350">starts to demand your attention, you know.</p>
<p t="4517460" d="5610">It's like a repression, and then that's
especially the case if there's a problem that</p>
<p t="4523070" d="3430">you're trying to solve that your current worldview
isn't really solving.</p>
<p t="4526500" d="5350">It's like your attention is going to be
drawn unconsciously to that which you've ignored</p>
<p t="4531850" d="6790">and put down, and so Jung saw the development
of alchemy as a parallel to the development</p>
<p t="4538640" d="6090">of Christianity, but alchemy studied matter,
which was forbidden in a sense.</p>
<p t="4544730" d="2870">It was damned from the Christian perspective.</p>
<p t="4547600" d="3720">The alchemists were studying the transmutations
of matter.</p>
<p t="4551320" d="3150">They had an intuition that there was information
locked in that.</p>
<p t="4554470" d="1170">In matter.</p>
<p t="4555640" d="3370">And that if you could just figure out how
to interact with it properly, then you can</p>
<p t="4559010" d="4670">free up the information, and they symbolized
that in the dreamlike manner.</p>
<p t="4563680" d="3340">The dreamlike manner was you could discover
the philosopher's stone and that would give</p>
<p t="4567020" d="4050">you, you know, wealth, health, and eternal
life.</p>
<p t="4571070" d="6170">Well as far as Jung was concerned, that was
a dream, and it was like an artistic production.</p>
<p t="4577240" d="4970">It was like the scaffolding of the scientific
perspective because it isn't like people went</p>
<p t="4582210" d="4190">from medieval Christianity to full fledged
scientists like overnight.</p>
<p t="4586400" d="3790">It took hundreds of years for this to occur.</p>
<p t="4590190" d="4270">There were changes in the substrata of thought
that were occurring as this was happening</p>
<p t="4594460" d="5340">and Jung traced that back more than 1,600
years in the development of alchemy.</p>
<p t="4599800" d="4910">And so, the dream of alchemy was that you
could discover - you could master the transmutations</p>
<p t="4604710" d="4560">of matter such that there would be no disease,
that no one would die, and everyone was wealthy.</p>
<p t="4609270" d="6370">Well okay that, as far as Jung was concerned,
that provided the motivation for science because</p>
<p t="4615640" d="3480">one of the things you might ask is well, why
do people do science.</p>
<p t="4619120" d="2940">I mean, most people never have right.</p>
<p t="4622060" d="1250">It's not very old.</p>
<p t="4623310" d="1190">Six hundred years.</p>
<p t="4624500" d="2070">It only emerged in one place, roughly speaking.</p>
<p t="4626570" d="5840">It's very fragile, and unlikely, and plus
just think of what you have to do if you're</p>
<p t="4632410" d="1000">a scientist.</p>
<p t="4633410" d="4730">You know, if you're a scientist and you use
a microscope - a high powered microscope - you</p>
<p t="4638140" d="4670">have to spend ten thousand hours looking through
that damn thing before you can see what's</p>
<p t="4642810" d="5090">there, and so you think that's a weird thing
for a tree dwelling ape to be doing.</p>
<p t="4647900" d="4740">You know what I mean, it's such a warp of
our natural, of our natural instincts and</p>
<p t="4652640" d="4530">our, you know, our desire to make contact
with other people and to be doing something</p>
<p t="4657170" d="4240">exciting, and you're looking through this
damn tube, you know, and it's even painful.</p>
<p t="4661410" d="2440">What the hell is motivating you?</p>
<p t="4663850" d="4170">And the answer would be, well you think you're
doing something good.</p>
<p t="4668020" d="2500">You think that science is going to benefit
mankind.</p>
<p t="4670520" d="3050">So it's nested necessarily in a motivated
system.</p>
<p t="4673570" d="3170">It isn't that you do science because you want
to discover facts.</p>
<p t="4676740" d="4320">It's that you do science to discover facts
so that things improve.</p>
<p t="4681060" d="2210">Isn't it?</p>
<p t="4683270" d="6330">And you just can't ignore the fact that you're
doing it in the hopes that things will improve.</p>
<p t="4689600" d="4200">You can't just take that out of the equation
and say, “No I'm purely objective.”</p>
<p t="4693800" d="5780">It's like A, you're not and you better not
be, you know, because a purely objective person</p>
<p t="4699580" d="2280">wouldn't be a person.</p>
<p t="4701860" d="2150">You couldn't even communicate with someone
like that.</p>
<p t="4704010" d="3220">Plus they wouldn't be able to - someone like
that wouldn't be able to determine what was</p>
<p t="4707230" d="4440">relevant - distinguish what was relevant and
what wasn't relevant.</p>
<p t="4711670" d="2560">You need motivational systems to do that,
and I can tell you.</p>
<p t="4714230" d="4800">When you're looking at a data set, there's
an infinite number of things that you can</p>
<p t="4719030" d="1440">look at in that data set.</p>
<p t="4720470" d="1000">Literally.</p>
<p t="4721470" d="4640">I mean there's no end to the statistical procedures
that you can implement.</p>
<p t="4726110" d="3370">It's like fiddling with a photo with Photoshop.</p>
<p t="4729480" d="4350">It's like man, you can fiddle with that
damn thing for the rest of your life, and</p>
<p t="4733830" d="6630">so what that means is that the complexity
that's there can't be dealt with objectively</p>
<p t="4740460" d="5740">because if you deal with it objectively, there's
no way of separating the one path through</p>
<p t="4746200" d="2861">the data from all the other millions of paths
through the data.</p>
<p t="4749061" d="3419">It's not like when you're doing statistics
man, it's not like you take a bunch of numbers</p>
<p t="4752480" d="2530">and you feed it through the meat grinder and
out comes the results.</p>
<p t="4755010" d="2300">It is absolutely nothing like that.</p>
<p t="4757310" d="5139">You're making ethical choices at every single
level of the decision, and you know, if you're</p>
<p t="4762449" d="2021">- and I teach my students this too.</p>
<p t="4764470" d="4070">So I want them to be straight scientists,
and there's lots of things that can warp you</p>
<p t="4768540" d="4160">as a scientist, and one can be you want to
have a career, and the other is you want to</p>
<p t="4772700" d="5710">climb up the primate, the scientist primate
dominance hierarchy, and you know fair enough.</p>
<p t="4778410" d="4960">You need to have a career, and maybe the ambition
is worth it, but the problem with that is</p>
<p t="4783370" d="5500">that can make you do things that violate the
principles of the entire enterprise, and that's</p>
<p t="4788870" d="3900">happening - I mean it's been scandalous
particularly in social psychology because</p>
<p t="4792770" d="3710">people do what's called data mining and
they just keep doing their analysis until</p>
<p t="4796480" d="4460">something significant pops up and then they
write a story about why that's important.</p>
<p t="4800940" d="1820">I'm not cynical about that.</p>
<p t="4802760" d="1290">I understand why it happens.</p>
<p t="4804050" d="4820">I think it's inevitable that it happens
some because lots of people who are publishing,</p>
<p t="4808870" d="2810">it's like the first bloody thing or second
thing they've ever published.</p>
<p t="4811680" d="2170">They don't know what they're doing.</p>
<p t="4813850" d="2290">There's gonna be error like mad.</p>
<p t="4816140" d="1740">But I tell my students, “Look.</p>
<p t="4817880" d="4860">If you're going to do statistical analysis
properly, you have to get yourself oriented.</p>
<p t="4822740" d="2090">What the hell are you doing?</p>
<p t="4824830" d="2200">What is it that you're really doing?”</p>
<p t="4827030" d="3540">And you think well I'm trying to discover
something solid, and the reason I'm trying</p>
<p t="4830570" d="3820">to do that is because there should be benefits
from that otherwise the whole enterprise is</p>
<p t="4834390" d="3850">foolish, and you might as well be a bloody
- you might as well go work in finance if</p>
<p t="4838240" d="4110">you're not interested in that because - really,
you're not going to make any money as a scientist</p>
<p t="4842350" d="4190">and you can make lots of money in finance,
and you're smart enough to go into finance.</p>
<p t="4846540" d="4430">So, if that's what you want - if you want
power and money, and I'm not complaining about</p>
<p t="4850970" d="2040">that, it's like go where it is.</p>
<p t="4853010" d="1740">But science isn't it.</p>
<p t="4854750" d="5310">If you want to discover facts, maybe, and
that maybe of some benefit at some point,</p>
<p t="4860060" d="1460">then you become a scientist.</p>
<p t="4861520" d="4760">Okay, so that you gotta keep your eye on the
ball, and then you have to decide if pursuing</p>
<p t="4866280" d="5270">that line of truth and benefit supersedes
whatever you might do to build your career.</p>
<p t="4871550" d="2660">Okay, cause you're always playing that game.</p>
<p t="4874210" d="1000">Always.</p>
<p t="4875210" d="4390">Your whole life, and that's actually why so
much of scientific research is wrong.</p>
<p t="4879600" d="3730">There's error too, and there's all sorts of
other reasons, and you can't expect a system</p>
<p t="4883330" d="4380">to do much better than produce five percent
of useful output anyways.</p>
<p t="4887710" d="5520">So, okay and then the other thing is you have
to also be afraid, and here's what you should</p>
<p t="4893230" d="1060">be afraid of.</p>
<p t="4894290" d="3160">Let's say that you discover something that
isn't there.</p>
<p t="4897450" d="3730">Okay, then you're gonna spend the next fifteen
years studying it.</p>
<p t="4901180" d="4350">So if you wanna spend your next fifteen years
studying this thing that you've conjured out</p>
<p t="4905530" d="1640">of nothing, then go right ahead.</p>
<p t="4907170" d="3530">But if you don't want to do that, then you
better be properly oriented when you do your</p>
<p t="4910700" d="5550">statistical analysis, and that's because statistical
analysis is an ethical process, and so is</p>
<p t="4916250" d="2800">science because it has to be.</p>
<p t="4919050" d="6910">If it isn't nested inside ethics, fundamentally,
then god only knows.</p>
<p t="4925960" d="1470">It can be completely destructive.</p>
<p t="4927430" d="1700">It could be counterproductive.</p>
<p t="4929130" d="6980">Like, so - ah so then there's a variety of
reasons why the Darwinian bucket is sort of</p>
<p t="4936110" d="2290">- it's the outside.</p>
<p t="4938400" d="3700">You don't get any farther out than that as
far as I can tell.</p>
<p t="4942100" d="4720">So, and it's the Darwinian world to which
we're adapted, you know.</p>
<p t="4946820" d="1790">That's why we perceive things as threats.</p>
<p t="4948610" d="2120">That's why we perceive things as positive.</p>
<p t="4950730" d="2090">That's why we perceive things as negative.</p>
<p t="4952820" d="3520">You know, and we tend to think those are overlays
on a deeper reality.</p>
<p t="4956340" d="6720">It's like that is not so clear, and you
know, I didn't know this but when I was working</p>
<p t="4963060" d="6430">out these ideas, I had never read anything
that Heidegger had written although his influences</p>
<p t="4969490" d="4320">wormed its way into many fields and I undoubtedly
picked up some of his ideas, you know, because</p>
<p t="4973810" d="4330">they get embedded in other places, but certainly
one of Heidegger's claims was that Western</p>
<p t="4978140" d="6290">philosophy got off on the wrong foot right
at the beginning because it didn't study being.</p>
<p t="4984430" d="5890">It started to think about thought, and what's
- the real issue is being what is being?</p>
<p t="4990320" d="4940">Well being is what you experience, and for
the Heideggerians, that's reality.</p>
<p t="4995260" d="3010">There isn't a reality underneath that.</p>
<p t="4998270" d="4540">Now, it requires a real shift in perspective
to start to try to think that way, and I think</p>
<p t="5002810" d="3480">the easiest way to do it is to think both
ways, you know.</p>
<p t="5006290" d="1250">Sometimes you think like a Newtonian.</p>
<p t="5007540" d="2560">Fair enough, and then other times you don't.</p>
<p t="5010100" d="3660">And you need to know when to think like a
Newtonian, and when to think like someone</p>
<p t="5013760" d="8030">who understands that the phenomena of meaning
that surrounds us are legitimate, and it's</p>
<p t="5021790" d="3950">a very interesting thing, and this is one
of the things that's really driven me through</p>
<p t="5025740" d="7420">this material is okay so we can make a case
that like lower order meanings are real.</p>
<p t="5033160" d="7420">Like if you perceive a bear or a cliff as
a threat, then that's so you don't die, and</p>
<p t="5040580" d="3560">it's worked really well for things that
have been chased by bears for ever since there's</p>
<p t="5044140" d="6110">been bears, and way before that.</p>
<p t="5050250" d="2310">But then there's another question that emerges.</p>
<p t="5052560" d="1610">So okay, here's the question.</p>
<p t="5054170" d="5740">So, you've got all these underlying motivational
systems that are built into you as a consequence</p>
<p t="5059910" d="1900">of evolutionary processes.</p>
<p t="5061810" d="5560">So let's say it's your body and the manifestation
of your body in your brain, in your mind.</p>
<p t="5067370" d="6340">It's your basic mammalian wiring, and you've
been working on that ever since we've had</p>
<p t="5073710" d="1000">nervous systems.</p>
<p t="5074710" d="1890">It's a very long period of time.</p>
<p t="5076600" d="1230">That sets you up.</p>
<p t="5077830" d="7100">Now you have to add complexity to that, right,
because when you're trying to - because those</p>
<p t="5084930" d="6010">systems only have a finite time range so when
you're angry, for example, you're angry right</p>
<p t="5090940" d="4930">now and in fact part of a utility of angry
is that it's right now because it's a</p>
<p t="5095870" d="3800">problem solving mechanism for dealing with
some obstacle that you can't get rid of any</p>
<p t="5099670" d="3970">other way than to say, “To hell with the
future,” roughly speaking and deal with</p>
<p t="5103640" d="1000">it right now.</p>
<p t="5104640" d="4720">Now it's dangerous, obviously, but it's
also necessary because otherwise maybe you</p>
<p t="5109360" d="4260">get locked into an argument, and you just
stand there arguing for the rest of your life,</p>
<p t="5113620" d="1000">you know.</p>
<p t="5114620" d="3000">At some point you say, I'm not talking to
you anymore, and the anger does that.</p>
<p t="5117620" d="2160">It makes you impulsive and you can walk away.</p>
<p t="5119780" d="2640">You know, and sometimes that's the right
conclusion to an argument.</p>
<p t="5122420" d="4740">You know, you're not going to win, and you
don't want to keep arguing so why do you stop?</p>
<p t="5127160" d="1000">You get annoyed.</p>
<p t="5128160" d="1000">It's a solution.</p>
<p t="5129160" d="3250">You've got all these basic biological systems.</p>
<p t="5132410" d="4820">Now obviously, no one of them has the answer,
and you know that because if it did, you wouldn't</p>
<p t="5137230" d="2660">need a bunch of them, and you have a whole
bunch of them.</p>
<p t="5139890" d="5490">You have pain, and anxiety, and exploration,
and play, and sexuality, and hunger, and thirst,</p>
<p t="5145380" d="5710">and you know you can come up with probably
twelve basic emotions and motivational systems.</p>
<p t="5151090" d="4940">Okay, so you need all twelve of those in order
to orient yourselves properly in the world</p>
<p t="5156030" d="4280">just like you need your five senses, but then
another problem starts to emerge and that</p>
<p t="5160310" d="7180">problem is okay, those things have to be regulated
properly, but they have to be regulated across</p>
<p t="5167490" d="6110">multiple spans of time, and then they have
to be regulated across multiple different</p>
<p t="5173600" d="1970">complexities of social environment.</p>
<p t="5175570" d="2450">So you don't just have one system of twelve.</p>
<p t="5178020" d="6760">Now, you have a very large number of systems
of twelve for very long spans of time, so</p>
<p t="5184780" d="3620">then you think, well out of that emerges a
solution.</p>
<p t="5188400" d="2160">We talked about already with the evolution
of games.</p>
<p t="5190560" d="1950">Out of that emerges a solution.</p>
<p t="5192510" d="2740">You might think about those as higher order
meanings.</p>
<p t="5195250" d="3780">So, and you know that, and you do it and you
believe it.</p>
<p t="5199030" d="1730">That's the thing that's cool.</p>
<p t="5200760" d="1950">Here you are in university.</p>
<p t="5202710" d="1570">Well you ask yourself why?</p>
<p t="5204280" d="5070">You might think, well what do you have to
believe in order to be university?</p>
<p t="5209350" d="5640">Well, at some point, your beliefs run out
and you're just here because you've made that</p>
<p t="5214990" d="1000">decision.</p>
<p t="5215990" d="2150">But I can ask you, you know, why are you in
university?</p>
<p t="5218140" d="4590">And most people have about five reasons, and
then they don't know what to say.</p>
<p t="5222730" d="5080">So what that means is they have reason A,
and reason B, and reason C, and reason D,</p>
<p t="5227810" d="4380">and then they're just acting it out after
that, and if you keep questioning them, they</p>
<p t="5232190" d="2520">get perturbed and they'll get annoyed.</p>
<p t="5234710" d="1250">Sometimes they'll cry.</p>
<p t="5235960" d="2770">Sometimes they'll get angry, like if you're
really going after someone, it's like what</p>
<p t="5238730" d="1850">the hell are you up to and why?</p>
<p t="5240580" d="3490">You know, sometimes you have to do that to
untangle something very complex.</p>
<p t="5244070" d="4330">At some point, people just - they get angry
or they cry, and that means to hell with you</p>
<p t="5248400" d="3850">or you're bullying me, leave me alone, and
that's supposed to get rid of you, you know,</p>
<p t="5252250" d="3920">but it doesn't work if you really want to
get down to the answers.</p>
<p t="5256170" d="3650">Well, partly what we're trying to figure
out is why the hell are you in university?</p>
<p t="5259820" d="3330">You might say, “Well, to get a job,” but
I might say, “Well why in the world would</p>
<p t="5263150" d="1800">that make you satisfied with life?”</p>
<p t="5264950" d="4300">Why do you think that would make you satisfied
with life, and you might say, “Well it's</p>
<p t="5269250" d="1170">better than not having a job.”</p>
<p t="5270420" d="4360">It's like yeah yeah fair enough, you know,
like right let's not forget the practical,</p>
<p t="5274780" d="2320">but it isn't the solution.</p>
<p t="5277100" d="5820">It's part of a solution, and the question
is do you really believe there's a solution?</p>
<p t="5282920" d="4810">Well you must because you believe it enough
so that you're here, and then you believe</p>
<p t="5287730" d="4650">that has something to do with the ability
to think - and you believe that has something</p>
<p t="5292380" d="3810">to do with the necessity of understanding
your history and you believe that it has something</p>
<p t="5296190" d="6850">to do with the utility of exposing yourself
to what in principle are great rate historical</p>
<p t="5303040" d="1730">and literary works.</p>
<p t="5304770" d="5080">You assume that that's all valid because even
if it's implicitly, if it's implicitly,</p>
<p t="5309850" d="4570">it means you're imitating someone who assumes
all that, but either way here you are.</p>
<p t="5314420" d="3360">You're doing something, and the questions
is - and maybe this is the critical, I think</p>
<p t="5317780" d="4180">this was the critical question of the 20th
century.</p>
<p t="5321960" d="3170">Is there any reality to what you are doing,
or is it just arbitrary?</p>
<p t="5325130" d="6790">If it's arbitrary, well you know that's
a path to nihilism because who cares what</p>
<p t="5331920" d="1770">you do?</p>
<p t="5333690" d="1460">Whatever you do, you're ruined.</p>
<p t="5335150" d="2540">You can make a strong case for that, you know.</p>
<p t="5337690" d="5640">But the problem with that seems to be nihilism
- try it for a while, you know.</p>
<p t="5343330" d="6570">What it produces is misery, and people generally
believe in misery, and they generally believe</p>
<p t="5349900" d="3780">that it's not a good thing to have, and
so I would say nihilism is a self defeating</p>
<p t="5353680" d="5280">proposition if you assume that misery is actually
a source of valid information, and you all</p>
<p t="5358960" d="5200">do because you know, if someone is jabbing
you with a pen, you're going to move you arm</p>
<p t="5364160" d="4340">because you feel that if you can avoid some
misery, that's a good thing.</p>
<p t="5368500" d="3140">So you have faith in your experience at that
level.</p>
<p t="5371640" d="5470">Well then you might say well you know, if
you can really make a solid case for the believability</p>
<p t="5377110" d="4710">for certain kinds of experiences, that they're
real, why can't you make a case for the believability</p>
<p t="5381820" d="1980">for higher forms of meaning?</p>
<p t="5383800" d="1680">Maybe they're not arbitrary.</p>
<p t="5385480" d="4520">We don't know, but I tell you if you act like
they're arbitrary, you get into trouble very,</p>
<p t="5390000" d="5300">very rapidly because you either become nihilistic
or halfway down the trip to nihilism, you</p>
<p t="5395300" d="5370">adopt some horrible ideology and then you
know, you're possessed by it, and then you're</p>
<p t="5400670" d="4860">well - then you're not going to live your
own life because you're going to live the</p>
<p t="5405530" d="3850">life of the ideology and you're going to be
dangerous to everyone around you and also</p>
<p t="5409380" d="2880">impervious to any sort of reasonable communication.</p>
<p t="5412260" d="5060">So if those are the two consequences of making
the presumption of arbitrary meaning at a</p>
<p t="5417320" d="3271">higher order level, then to me, they've invalidated
themselves already.</p>
<p t="5420591" d="2329">We've already had that experiment.</p>
<p t="5422920" d="1110">It didn't work.</p>
<p t="5424030" d="2810">And so then the question is well what's next?</p>
<p t="5426840" d="5870">Well that's partly what we're trying to
figure out right now.</p>
