<p t="33040" d="3270">You really can't tell the meaning of someone's
life till the very end.</p>
<p t="36310" d="5390">And it's for the same reason, right, is
that how all the pieces fit together in the</p>
<p t="41700" d="3800">story or in the life is not necessarily determined
until the final moment.</p>
<p t="45500" d="5060">And I think that's part of the reason too,
why among Catholics, for example, and Christians</p>
<p t="50560" d="4370">in general, there's an idea that salvation
can always be attained, right?</p>
<p t="54930" d="2400">Right up to the last moment, no matter what
your life was like.</p>
<p t="57330" d="3330">And you think: Well, that's a pretty cheap
trick, you know, because you can run around</p>
<p t="60660" d="2740">doing terrible things your whole life, but
as long as you can get it together at the</p>
<p t="63400" d="1680">last second, then you're Scot-free.</p>
<p t="65080" d="4970">But if you think about it in terms of a story,
then you can understand how that could conceivably</p>
<p t="70050" d="1810">be the case.</p>
<p t="71860" d="3910">And it's for this reason, of course, that
this lecture in particular makes me nervous</p>
<p t="75770" d="4390">more than any of the other ones I do, because
I've been telling you a story that's basically</p>
<p t="80160" d="5340">40 hours long, right, and its spoken forum,
and then who knows how long in its written</p>
<p t="85500" d="1000">form.</p>
<p t="86500" d="3790">And it's complicated to pull it together
properly.</p>
<p t="90290" d="4359">And that's partly because, as far as I've
been concerned, we've been talking about</p>
<p t="94649" d="3561">issues in psychology that are more difficult
than any other.</p>
<p t="98210" d="4040">First of all, conceptually, even from a neuropsychological
perspective, because I've been offering</p>
<p t="102250" d="5200">you a model of the way the brain processes
the environment, that I think is really novel.</p>
<p t="107450" d="3590">And I think it reflects the current state
of neuroscience.</p>
<p t="111040" d="4190">And - but more than that, there's the problem
that we've been dealing with issues all</p>
<p t="115230" d="6030">the way along of life and death, and of war
and destruction, and of the possibility for</p>
<p t="121260" d="5350">clear-headed optimism, right?
and possibility which, as we've discussed,</p>
<p t="126610" d="4150">more or less escaped Tolstoy, say, for most
of his life, right, because when Tolstoy woke</p>
<p t="130760" d="5690">up from his delusions, he looked at the world
and he said: Well, clearly it's such a terrible</p>
<p t="136450" d="6221">place that, if you're not looking at it
through the veils of illusion, there's no</p>
<p t="142671" d="4859">way that you can do anything but stand in
opposition to it once you understand its basic</p>
<p t="147530" d="1200">structure, right?</p>
<p t="148730" d="5680">Suffering and innocence suffering, and complete
vulnerability, and the whole existential mess</p>
<p t="154410" d="1540">that makes up life.</p>
<p t="155950" d="9820">Now it turns out that Tolstoy overcame his
rationally induced cynicism in a kind of mystical</p>
<p t="165770" d="2689">way.</p>
<p t="168459" d="5011">He had a dream that he was suspended from
some transcendent space by a belt around the</p>
<p t="173470" d="3190">middle of his waist, which hung him over a
pit of chaos.</p>
<p t="176660" d="2720">And in that image, he found comfort.</p>
<p t="179380" d="2380">And fair enough, it's a powerful image.</p>
<p t="181760" d="2509">But it's not well delineated, right?</p>
<p t="184269" d="4841">And it worked well for Tolstoy, and you can
see that the image has power, but you can't--</p>
<p t="189110" d="1969">you can't grab it with your rational mind.</p>
<p t="191079" d="2880">You can't take it into pieces and analyze
it as an argument.</p>
<p t="193959" d="2991">And that's what we do if we're intellectuals,
right?</p>
<p t="196950" d="4970">We try to understand the detailed structure
of something.</p>
<p t="201920" d="6340">And I think the detailed structure of what
Tolstoy apprehended as optimistic is actually</p>
<p t="208260" d="1000">comprehensible.</p>
<p t="209260" d="6810">And we've been working towards that and
circling around it the entire course of this</p>
<p t="216070" d="2090">lecture series.</p>
<p t="218160" d="4750">But I have found with this material that with
each circling around the target, it gets clearer</p>
<p t="222910" d="1000">and clearer.</p>
<p t="223910" d="1000">It's a funny thing.</p>
<p t="224910" d="4210">It's like you're looking at something
that's too complicated to see all at once.</p>
<p t="229120" d="3420">So you have to look at it from multiple different
perspectives, and again and again.</p>
<p t="232540" d="3060">And each time you look at it, it becomes clearer
and clearer.</p>
<p t="235600" d="2660">And that's still the case for me when I
go through this material.</p>
<p t="238260" d="2490">Every time I go through it, I think: Oh yeah,
that piece fits there.</p>
<p t="240750" d="1130">And that piece fits there.</p>
<p t="241880" d="2070">And that's how that makes sense.</p>
<p t="243950" d="3410">And: Oh that's a lot more remarkable than
I thought it was to begin with… and so on.</p>
<p t="247360" d="1580">And it seems fundamentally inexhaustible.</p>
<p t="248940" d="4310">And of course, that's what you'd expect
from deep, deep stories, right?</p>
<p t="253250" d="3090">Stories that have been around for thousands
and thousands of years, wouldn't have been</p>
<p t="256340" d="4760">around for thousands and thousands of years
unless they were in some sense inexhaustible.</p>
<p t="261100" d="6770">And we've talked about some of the processes
that might contribute to that inexhaustibility.</p>
<p t="267870" d="4980">So at the beginning of the lecture series,
I told you to consider the assumption that</p>
<p t="272850" d="2710">there was more than one way of looking at
the world, right?</p>
<p t="275560" d="4919">There was the standard materialist sort of
scientific viewpoint, which was that the world</p>
<p t="280479" d="6361">was made up of objects – independently existent,
as among them - the objects have no intrinsic</p>
<p t="286840" d="1810">value, one way or another.</p>
<p t="288650" d="5580">And the issue of meaning per se wasn't included
in that account.</p>
<p t="294230" d="3050">And then I said: Well wait, there's another
way of looking at the world, that we spent</p>
<p t="297280" d="5490">just as much time developing, that we utilize
even more, and that's the narrative…</p>
<p t="302770" d="5540">That's the narrative way of looking at the
world; to consider the nature of experience</p>
<p t="308310" d="4880">rather than the nature of objects as real;
to consider your experience as real, even</p>
<p t="313190" d="4030">though it includes things that can't be
easily and tangibly identified – things</p>
<p t="317220" d="5430">like emotions, which of course you find compelling,
sometimes even beyond your will.</p>
<p t="322650" d="6760">Things like motivational states, fantasies,
ideals, all the things that compel your behaviour</p>
<p t="329410" d="4020">and give you some sense that there's a direction
to life.</p>
<p t="333430" d="5730">people who study emotion and perception have
come to understand that the act of transforming</p>
<p t="339160" d="4320">the world into something simply made out of
objects is incredibly difficult.</p>
<p t="343480" d="3420">It's so difficult that we haven't been
able to design machines that can do it at</p>
<p t="346900" d="1000">all.</p>
<p t="347900" d="2890">It turns out also that when we look at the
world, we're not just looking at it with</p>
<p t="350790" d="4460">our visual systems, but we're looking at
it with our motor output systems and our emotions.</p>
<p t="355250" d="4930">So that, when you look at something like a
chair, which just stands there for you like</p>
<p t="360180" d="5781">an object, it turns out that the mechanical
systems – the motor systems – that you</p>
<p t="365961" d="4049">would use to use the chair to sit on it are
activated during the act of perception.</p>
<p t="370010" d="3610">It also turns out sometimes that when you
look at something, especially if it's something</p>
<p t="373620" d="6000">you don't understand and that it's - and
that scares you – you actually react to</p>
<p t="379620" d="4870">it; conceptualize it with your body and with
your emotions before you have any idea what</p>
<p t="384490" d="7150">it is from the perspective of an object.</p>
<p t="391640" d="4470">When you look at the world and when you think
about the world, you have to do it from a</p>
<p t="396110" d="3360">motivated perspective and an emotionally ridden
perspective.</p>
<p t="399470" d="4670">You can't even see the world without being
gripped by your motivation and emotional states.</p>
<p t="404140" d="7160">And so, the idea that rationality or perception
is somehow separate from, or super-ordinate</p>
<p t="411300" d="4820">to perception and emotion is just wrong.</p>
<p t="416120" d="3960">We understand now that you can't even think
without being motivated.</p>
<p t="420080" d="2080">You can't see the world without being motivated.</p>
<p t="422160" d="3110">And that means you always look at the world
through a kind of lens.</p>
<p t="425270" d="4130">And the lens is a narrowing lens, and it has
to be because the world is so complicated,</p>
<p t="429400" d="1220">you can't see it all at once.</p>
<p t="430620" d="4630">You're only seeing tiny slices of it in
time, and tiny slices of it in space.</p>
<p t="435250" d="4960">And even then, you have to narrow it to only
those things that are relevant to you at that</p>
<p t="440210" d="1000">moment.</p>
<p t="441210" d="1320">And we don't know exactly how you do that.</p>
<p t="442530" d="7670">We know that it takes years and years of perceptual
work in infancy, say so that you manage to</p>
<p t="450200" d="2360">build up an object conception of the world.</p>
<p t="452560" d="3690">That's probably all your doing in the first
two or three years of life.</p>
<p t="456250" d="1490">And you're doing it constantly.</p>
<p t="457740" d="4190">And it's just as complicated as learning
language, say, or even more complicated.</p>
<p t="461930" d="3310">Most of it's invisible, and we don't know
how children do that.</p>
<p t="465240" d="2140">And by the time they can talk, they've already
done it.</p>
<p t="467380" d="2260">So, they can't even tell us what they're
doing.</p>
<p t="469640" d="2920">It takes a long time to build up an object
world.</p>
<p t="472560" d="4400">And when you look at the world - when you
go from Point A to Point B - even when you're</p>
<p t="476960" d="5270">doing something as simple as looking for food
in-in the kitchen, you ignore everything about</p>
<p t="482230" d="4140">the world that isn't relevant to making
yourself a peanut butter sandwich, and you</p>
<p t="486370" d="4930">focus in on those few things that are – the
refrigerator, the food, the knives, the cutlery,</p>
<p t="491300" d="1000">and so on.</p>
<p t="492300" d="1680">And everything else is screened out.</p>
<p t="493980" d="4640">Then, you can't help but look at the world
through that kind of lens.</p>
<p t="498620" d="4720">And the lenses change and you can be in different
motivational states, and they can change because</p>
<p t="503340" d="1420">of internal transformations.</p>
<p t="504760" d="1030">You're not hungry.</p>
<p t="505790" d="1000">You're thirsty.</p>
<p t="506790" d="2080">Or you're not thirsty, you're interested
in someone.</p>
<p t="508870" d="4940">Or somebody is telling you a story and then
you adopt their motivational framework, and</p>
<p t="513810" d="1330">you can see the world through their eyes.</p>
<p t="515140" d="3970">And now, we know the neural machinery for
that, and we already talked about that.</p>
<p t="519110" d="5119">So, we can toss back and forth these motivational
frames of reference and that gives us insight</p>
<p t="524229" d="2141">into someone else's world.</p>
<p t="526370" d="3019">You can look at the world endless numbers
of ways.</p>
<p t="529389" d="5661">And what you're trying to do it, out of
its infinite richness, so to speak, is to</p>
<p t="535050" d="4020">pull out parts of it that are useful for you
while you're moving from Point A to Point</p>
<p t="539070" d="2810">B.
And this can be a chair, if you want to sit</p>
<p t="541880" d="1000">down.</p>
<p t="542880" d="3530">But if you want to take a light bulb out of
the ceiling, then it's a stool, or a table.</p>
<p t="546410" d="4951">And whether or not it's a chair, or a stool,
or a table depends just as much on what you're</p>
<p t="551361" d="4129">doing as it does on what it is.</p>
<p t="555490" d="3480">And I think that's part of the reason why
human beings can be so infinitely creative,</p>
<p t="558970" d="1000">right?</p>
<p t="559970" d="1040">For us, the world isn't fixed.</p>
<p t="561010" d="1749">We never know what it's going to bring forth.</p>
<p t="562759" d="6851">So, 100 years ago, if someone would have said:
Well, you could build a machine on a wafer</p>
<p t="569610" d="6539">a centimetre square out of sand and if you
have enough of those machines then everyone</p>
<p t="576149" d="3721">in the world can be connected, and everyone
in the world can have an infinite library</p>
<p t="579870" d="1779">of verbal material, right?</p>
<p t="581649" d="1741">That's impossible, but it-it's not impossible.</p>
<p t="583390" d="7989">It turns out that silica has those properties,
and we can build unbelievably powerful machines</p>
<p t="591379" d="3181">out of nothing
And so then, that kind of makes you think</p>
<p t="594560" d="3680">about just what this nothing that we're
building things out of is, right?</p>
<p t="598240" d="6779">Because it seems to be able to reveal a constant
array of properties; properties that are essentially</p>
<p t="605019" d="1130">unlimited.</p>
<p t="606149" d="4771">And it's capacity to reveal those properties
seems to depend as much on our ability to</p>
<p t="610920" d="8430">interact with it - whatever that is - as it
does on whatever the stuff is.</p>
<p t="619350" d="5690">And we know, even from a strict object perception
of the world that the stuff that things are</p>
<p t="625040" d="4450">made of is a lot more complicated than we
had originally presumed, even as materialists,</p>
<p t="629490" d="8579">because materialists, realists, their philosophy
only holds down to about the subatomic level</p>
<p t="638069" d="2231">of analysis – a deterministic worldview.</p>
<p t="640300" d="4200">Below the subatomic level of analysis, there's
nothing deterministic at all.</p>
<p t="644500" d="3699">And the stuff that things are made of is so
mysterious that we can't even-- we can't</p>
<p t="648199" d="1000">grasp it.</p>
<p t="649199" d="1060">We can't comprehend it.</p>
<p t="650259" d="6901">So it turns out that rather than the story
world be, being dependent on the object world,</p>
<p t="657160" d="1080">it might be the other way around.</p>
<p t="658240" d="2440">The object world is dependent on the story
world.</p>
<p t="660680" d="4790">And that implies at least to some degree that
the story world is actually more real, whatever</p>
<p t="665470" d="1000">that means.</p>
<p t="666470" d="5469">And then, I told you that, well, the real
problem of life isn't so much “What do</p>
<p t="671939" d="4210">you do when you're around things that you
understand?”</p>
<p t="676149" d="4211">The real problem of life is: “What do you
do when you encounter something you can't</p>
<p t="680360" d="1120">conceptualize?”</p>
<p t="681480" d="4130">And I think a good recent example of that
was the bombing of the World Trade Towers,</p>
<p t="685610" d="4600">which people were compelled to watch over
and over and over and over.</p>
<p t="690210" d="2890">And if you ask someone: Well, what is it that
you're watching?</p>
<p t="693100" d="4750">They would say: Well, I'm watching the World
Trade Towers fall down but then, you might</p>
<p t="697850" d="1530">say: Well, why are you watching it over and
over?</p>
<p t="699380" d="2660">And they would say something like: Well, I
can't believe it.</p>
<p t="702040" d="2099">I can't believe it's happening.</p>
<p t="704139" d="1501">And what does that mean?</p>
<p t="705640" d="4819">It means something like: Whatever it is that's
happening here - whatever's being blown</p>
<p t="710459" d="2850">apart – exceeds my ability to model.</p>
<p t="713309" d="4351">And as a consequence, I have to expose myself
to it again and again and again, and again,</p>
<p t="717660" d="1760">to try to understand what's falling.</p>
<p t="719420" d="1560">Like, what's falling exactly?</p>
<p t="720980" d="1060">Is it just the towers?</p>
<p t="722040" d="2150">Is it 20,000 people?</p>
<p t="724190" d="2079">Is it the financial system of the U.S.?</p>
<p t="726269" d="2070">Is it the stability of the western world?</p>
<p t="728339" d="1661">Is it the beginning of World War III?</p>
<p t="730000" d="6059">Or as the former CIA director just mentioned
in the U.S.: The beginning of World War IV.</p>
<p t="736059" d="8931">What is it exactly that you're looking at
when something happens that you don't understand?</p>
<p t="744990" d="2039">And then you say: Well, how do you react to
that?</p>
<p t="747029" d="4841">And it turns out that you react mostly with
your body - not with your mind, not with your</p>
<p t="751870" d="3930">perceptual systems, not with your thoughts
– but with your emotions and your body.</p>
<p t="755800" d="4959">And that means you sweat, and you panic, and
you feel depressed, and you feel hurt, and</p>
<p t="760759" d="1000">you feel ashamed.</p>
<p t="761759" d="3700">And you're prepared for a catastrophe, which
is stress.</p>
<p t="765459" d="4281">And all that's basically non-cognitive and--
What that kind of means is that, when you</p>
<p t="769740" d="4699">encounter something you don't understand
the first manner in which you conceive of</p>
<p t="774439" d="5890">it, is embodied; emotional, physical, way
before you develop up an object representation,</p>
<p t="780329" d="2091">or a cognitive representation.</p>
<p t="782420" d="1300">You may not ever get it.</p>
<p t="783720" d="4339">Like, an event like that, or a worse event,
can throw someone into a tailspin that's</p>
<p t="788059" d="2891">so extreme that they never get out of it.</p>
<p t="790950" d="3749">So you'll see, for example, sometimes – and
this is more true among elderly people if</p>
<p t="794699" d="4080">their spouse dies – the probability that
they'll die in the next year - say, from</p>
<p t="798779" d="3631">a heart attack or something like that – increases
substantially.</p>
<p t="802410" d="1000">Why is that?</p>
<p t="803410" d="7259">It's because their conceptual frame was
so dependent on the existence of their spouse</p>
<p t="810669" d="5170">– say, someone they've lived with for
25 years – that the anxiety and uncertainty</p>
<p t="815839" d="5261">caused by their own anomalous disappearance
– their death is so extreme – that it</p>
<p t="821100" d="3620">sends their body into a physiological state
that's basically unbearable.</p>
<p t="824720" d="1219">And that does them in.</p>
<p t="825939" d="5520">And when you start to understand what having
your preconceptions rattled really means,</p>
<p t="831459" d="6470">then you also start to understand why people
are so motivated to protect their ideological</p>
<p t="837929" d="3511">territory, right – ideological territory--
that's how you see the world.</p>
<p t="841440" d="1449">That's your story.</p>
<p t="842889" d="5211">And you can't have your fundaments rattled
all the time because it throws everything</p>
<p t="848100" d="5760">into chaos, and that puts you in this terrible,
panicky, cortizol-ridden, stressful state</p>
<p t="853860" d="2339">that's really hard on you physically.</p>
<p t="856199" d="4130">So we know for example that if you're in
a state where you're chronically exposed</p>
<p t="860329" d="4711">to threat or punishment, which is the case
in depression, say, you produce a lot of cortizol,</p>
<p t="865040" d="3070">which is a stress hormone, and cortizol is
toxic.</p>
<p t="868110" d="3780">So the more of it you produce, the more you
kill off your hippocampus cells, and you really</p>
<p t="871890" d="3520">need them because they're a key to memory.</p>
<p t="875410" d="3789">You do in your immunological system-- there's
all sorts of negative side effects of cortizol</p>
<p t="879199" d="4330">poisoning - increase incidents of cardiovascular
disease, heightened rate of cancer.</p>
<p t="883529" d="2021">Plus, it's just no fun, right?</p>
<p t="885550" d="3110">It's the worst thing that can possibly happen
to you, essentially.</p>
<p t="888660" d="3880">If something unknown happens to you and blows
your frame of reference, right – knocks</p>
<p t="892540" d="4590">you for a loop, sends you to the underworld,
however you want to construe it – that's</p>
<p t="897130" d="4999">really going to upset your bandwagon and throw
you into a state that you'd do virtually</p>
<p t="902129" d="1250">anything to avoid.</p>
<p t="903379" d="5630">But by the same token, there is a possibility
that inside that chaotic nest, there's something</p>
<p t="909009" d="1070">you really need.</p>
<p t="910079" d="1910">And what's the logic there?</p>
<p t="911989" d="4520">Well, the logic is something like this: When
you look at the world, you only see a fragment</p>
<p t="916509" d="1000">of it.</p>
<p t="917509" d="4291">And that's good because it's pretty overwhelming,
and a fragment's generally more than enough.</p>
<p t="921800" d="4269">But all the information that you've ever
gathered in your entire life – to build</p>
<p t="926069" d="4661">yourself out of, and to make your life stable
– has come as a consequence of your ability</p>
<p t="930730" d="3520">to explore what you don't understand.</p>
<p t="934250" d="1939">And that's an unlimited capacity, right?</p>
<p t="936189" d="4231">No matter how much you explore and how much
information you gather, there's always the</p>
<p t="940420" d="2909">possibility that there's way more information
out there.</p>
<p t="943329" d="4151">And that means, if you have a problem and
you see that it's a problem, even though</p>
<p t="947480" d="5279">that's frightening, it's also a gateway
into a domain of possibility; and the possibility</p>
<p t="952759" d="4950">is this richly informative background that
could, in principle, provide you with any</p>
<p t="957709" d="4190">answer you need
And then you can think one more thing.</p>
<p t="961899" d="4810">And the old gods, Mars say, the god of war.</p>
<p t="966709" d="2610">Venus, the god of love.</p>
<p t="969319" d="2420">They're all internalized for us, right?</p>
<p t="971739" d="2340">We know that anger's a psychological state.</p>
<p t="974079" d="2850">Love is a psychological state.</p>
<p t="976929" d="5791">But if we look at our great religious traditions,
Christianity say, or Buddhism, just to take</p>
<p t="982720" d="1540">two as an example.</p>
<p t="984260" d="5639">We still have this notion that what these
figures represent is something external.</p>
<p t="989899" d="5110">Well you might say how primitive, right?</p>
<p t="995009" d="3961">Just as primitive as the idea that the god
of war is something external is the idea that</p>
<p t="998970" d="2580">this sort of figure is supposed to be something
external.</p>
<p t="1001550" d="3320">It's supposed to be something embodied, right?</p>
<p t="1004870" d="6300">It's a story about the nature of individual
moral responsibility</p>
<p t="1011170" d="7930">So the idea is something like this, well reality
itself, the existence of things seems to depend</p>
<p t="1019100" d="2519">on the existence of a finite observer.</p>
<p t="1021619" d="1770">So that we can see things from a perspective.</p>
<p t="1023389" d="3101">If you don't see things from a perspective,
everything is the same.</p>
<p t="1026490" d="2800">There's nothing delineated.</p>
<p t="1029290" d="4270">But if there's gonna be delineated things,
small things, insufficient things, and they're</p>
<p t="1033560" d="4690">gonna be aware, they're gonna be vulnerable
as a part of their limitation.</p>
<p t="1038250" d="5250">And so you say well, limitation is a precondition
for being.</p>
<p t="1043500" d="2319">And that means suffering is part and parcel
of being</p>
<p t="1045819" d="9551">Dostoevsky said clearly, look, I give you
all the cake you want.</p>
<p t="1055370" d="1210">You got a big house.</p>
<p t="1056580" d="2530">You got nothing to do but watch TV, right?</p>
<p t="1059110" d="1910">And propagate the species.</p>
<p t="1061020" d="1390">Are you happy?</p>
<p t="1062410" d="1530">And Dostoevsky says well no.</p>
<p t="1063940" d="1000">Why?</p>
<p t="1064940" d="4830">Well cause human beings are really fundamentally
you know, ungrateful and insane.</p>
<p t="1069770" d="3750">So if you give them some little comfortable
niche to occupy themselves with so they don't</p>
<p t="1073520" d="3940">have anything to worry about, the first thing
they're gonna do just like Adam and Eve basically</p>
<p t="1077460" d="6180">or just like Buddha, they're gonna run around
looking for the apple, looking for the snake,</p>
<p t="1083640" d="4680">looking for the trouble to smash the frame
into bits no matter how comfortable it is</p>
<p t="1088320" d="3630">just so they can get access to a little chaos
and have some fun.</p>
<p t="1091950" d="4210">And so then you think well maybe it's more
like the purpose of life isn't to avoid chaos</p>
<p t="1096160" d="1130">because we like chaos.</p>
<p t="1097290" d="1000">It's entertaining, right?</p>
<p t="1098290" d="1210">It keeps us alert and awake.</p>
<p t="1099500" d="3330">And it gives us something to do that really
has no end.</p>
<p t="1102830" d="4130">And so maybe the answer is something more
like well forget the frame of reference.</p>
<p t="1106960" d="4610">And forget the chaos but hit the balance right
between the two, right?</p>
<p t="1111570" d="2820">So that you got one foot where it's reasonably
comfortable.</p>
<p t="1114390" d="3140">And you got one foot out there where it's
kind of exciting and dangerous.</p>
<p t="1117530" d="1000">And that's perfect.</p>
<p t="1118530" d="5620">And then you think the state you wanna attain
that makes you resistant to even the greatest</p>
<p t="1124150" d="5890">anomalies, anomalies of death say or vulnerability
or mortality is exactly that, that position,</p>
<p t="1130040" d="1000">right?</p>
<p t="1131040" d="4870">Balanced right between the forces of chaos
and the forces of order or between, between</p>
<p t="1135910" d="1370">yin and yang.</p>
<p t="1137280" d="1890">And how do you know you're there?</p>
<p t="1139170" d="1910">Cause that's what it really boils down to.</p>
<p t="1141080" d="1680">How do you know that you're there?</p>
<p t="1142760" d="3420">And then you think okay, it's pretty simple.</p>
<p t="1146180" d="4250">You watch with your eyes open, just like Solzhenitsyn
watched.</p>
<p t="1150430" d="2350">You think, I don't know everything.</p>
<p t="1152780" d="1370">So let's see what I do know.</p>
<p t="1154150" d="1240">No preconceptions.</p>
<p t="1155390" d="5160">I'm not gonna shield myself from the truth
with some second rate frame of reference.</p>
<p t="1160550" d="3050">We don't believe in those anyways cause they're
always fragmentable.</p>
<p t="1163600" d="1480">I'm just gonna watch.</p>
<p t="1165080" d="1730">So when am I not miserable?</p>
<p t="1166810" d="3850">And then you think well, I'm not miserable
when I'm interested in thing, something, I</p>
<p t="1170660" d="1570">get interested in something.</p>
<p t="1172230" d="2890">I don't exactly know why I get interested
in it.</p>
<p t="1175120" d="1570">It catches me.</p>
<p t="1176690" d="6330">And what are the, what's the phenomenology
of being caught?</p>
<p t="1183020" d="2990">I'm not self-conscious when I'm engaged
in something.</p>
<p t="1186010" d="4940">I'm more like a child, which is why children
have intonations of immortality.</p>
<p t="1190950" d="2810">I'm engaged in this process.</p>
<p t="1193760" d="2400">I don't think about myself, so I'm not self-conscious.</p>
<p t="1196160" d="4520">I lose my sense of temporality because it
seems like I can do whatever it is that I'm</p>
<p t="1200680" d="2580">doing, thing that I enjoy for hours.</p>
<p t="1203260" d="1290">And the time flies by.</p>
<p t="1204550" d="2460">And I'm not even really aware of the surrounding
world.</p>
<p t="1207010" d="4790">And none of my existential concerns are paramount
at that time.</p>
<p t="1211800" d="3880">Every need is suppressed by my engagement
in the activity.</p>
<p t="1215680" d="4040">And then you say to yourself well, yeah, that
only happens like you know, ten minutes every</p>
<p t="1219720" d="2950">three days or something when I'm being particularly
miserable.</p>
<p t="1222670" d="3690">But you might say well the fact that it happens
at all is probably worth paying attention</p>
<p t="1226360" d="1000">to.</p>
<p t="1227360" d="4201">I mean if you believe that your experience
is real, like real, the fact that you can</p>
<p t="1231561" d="2689">get into a state like that at all is worth
paying attention to.</p>
<p t="1234250" d="3660">And so then you might say well that's, that's
where you're sense of ethics really starts</p>
<p t="1237910" d="1710">to arise.</p>
<p t="1239620" d="1190">what makes you interested?</p>
<p t="1240810" d="4380">Well it might be just as cracked and, and,
and peculiar as something you could possibly</p>
<p t="1245190" d="1000">imagine, right?</p>
<p t="1246190" d="1180">Your parents are against it.</p>
<p t="1247370" d="1590">Your friends are against it.</p>
<p t="1248960" d="2030">Even you're against it when you're thinking
clearly.</p>
<p t="1250990" d="4650">But there's still this reality that something
compels you.</p>
<p t="1255640" d="2660">And then you think well can you trust it?</p>
<p t="1258300" d="5060">And I think well that's a tough question because
I read a long time, for a long time I read</p>
<p t="1263360" d="1470">accounts of serial killers.</p>
<p t="1264830" d="3480">Cause I was really interested in what motivated
them, right?</p>
<p t="1268310" d="4020">And they're an interesting breed in many
ways, which is why there's such a popular</p>
<p t="1272330" d="1600">fascination with them.</p>
<p t="1273930" d="5790">And you think geez, maybe you can't trust
your interest, right?</p>
<p t="1279720" d="3800">Maybe it'll take you somewhere you don't wanna
go, like seriously where you don't wanna go.</p>
<p t="1283520" d="5160">How do you know that if you really let yourself
be who you could be, that you'd end up somewhere</p>
<p t="1288680" d="1000">good.</p>
<p t="1289680" d="4680">And so then you come to the second part of
the story, which is something like this; let's</p>
<p t="1294360" d="5720">say that you're a very, very, very finely
tuned biological machine, right?</p>
<p t="1300080" d="2630">Akin to a computer.</p>
<p t="1302710" d="5370">And then you say okay, you take a computer
and you feed it false information.</p>
<p t="1308080" d="2000">What do you get out?</p>
<p t="1310080" d="2430">False information, right?</p>
<p t="1312510" d="1760">Well you're stuck with this computer.</p>
<p t="1314270" d="1690">It's very complicated.</p>
<p t="1315960" d="4130">You kind of reside in it in some manner you
don't understand.</p>
<p t="1320090" d="5810">And yet, you're prone on occasions either
to deny the information altogether when you</p>
<p t="1325900" d="2910">walk away from something you know you shouldn't
walk from.</p>
<p t="1328810" d="2100">Or to feed it bad information.</p>
<p t="1330910" d="1930">And so then what if it, what if this was the
case?</p>
<p t="1332840" d="5290">What if it was the case that the systems that
orient you with regards to your interest can</p>
<p t="1338130" d="5130">become pathologized by any relationship you
have with yourself that's predicated on bad</p>
<p t="1343260" d="1180">faith?</p>
<p t="1344440" d="5800">And so then you think well, that's why there's
an ethical aspect to this redemptive process.</p>
<p t="1350240" d="4110">Like a real strenuous and strict ethical aspect
that goes something like this;</p>
<p t="1354350" d="5450">There are things that you can do, find yourself
engaged with the world at such a level that</p>
<p t="1359800" d="2690">your existential concerns could disappear.</p>
<p t="1362490" d="3980">And we can even understand that biochemically
to some degree because if you're really interested</p>
<p t="1366470" d="4120">in something you got a dopamine release an
exploratory dopamine release.</p>
<p t="1370590" d="1000">That's great.</p>
<p t="1371590" d="4780">I mean that's associated with positive affect,
with confidence, with increased immunological</p>
<p t="1376370" d="2320">functioning, with better memory functioning.</p>
<p t="1378690" d="1300">With learning.</p>
<p t="1379990" d="2580">Everything you want.</p>
<p t="1382570" d="6280">It's also potently anxiolytic and analgesic,
which means that if you're really pursuing</p>
<p t="1388850" d="4240">something that's compelling to you, you're
much more resistant biochemically to punishment,</p>
<p t="1393090" d="2440">disappointment, depression, pain, threat,
etcetera.</p>
<p t="1395530" d="3790">And it's not cause you're blind.</p>
<p t="1399320" d="1000">It's not cause you're blind.</p>
<p t="1400320" d="3860">It's cause your nervous system is optimally
tuned to make you maximally resistant.</p>
<p t="1404180" d="5950">And so then you might think if you were optimally
tuned, how resistant would you be?</p>
<p t="1410130" d="1300">You don't know, right?</p>
<p t="1411430" d="5360">Cause it's in a spiral that never stops moving
uphill.</p>
<p t="1416790" d="2210">We don't know what the upper end is.</p>
<p t="1419000" d="4770">And we have exemplars that might indicate
what that upper end could be.</p>
<p t="1423770" d="2130">But we don't actually know.</p>
<p t="1425900" d="6130">So then you think okay, well here's the here's
the rule, say, something like this.</p>
<p t="1432030" d="3800">If you look at the world from this perspective,
which is something you have to decide if you're</p>
<p t="1435830" d="10150">you know, you find compelling and reasonable,
the rule is this; you're always gonna run</p>
<p t="1445980" d="1810">into anomaly, right?</p>
<p t="1447790" d="5870">And anomaly's always gonna look, look to
you like, like this.</p>
<p t="1453660" d="1720">And
it's no bloody wonder you wanna run away from</p>
<p t="1455380" d="1000">that.</p>
<p t="1456380" d="3660">I mean in some ways your whole body's telling
you watch out, and for good reason because</p>
<p t="1460040" d="1120">it's no joke.</p>
<p t="1461160" d="4350">But then there's more to the story because
the anomalous thing, that's everything you</p>
<p t="1465510" d="2090">don't know.</p>
<p t="1467600" d="3260">you might say well, you're going out with
someone and you wanna have a long term relationship.</p>
<p t="1470860" d="1000">They betray you.</p>
<p t="1471860" d="2930">How could there be any good in that?</p>
<p t="1474790" d="4800">That's certainly what you're gonna ask when
you first encounter the unexpected information</p>
<p t="1479590" d="5070">But then you might think could be that I'm
a little too naive for my own good.</p>
<p t="1484660" d="1000">Right?</p>
<p t="1485660" d="3970">People pull me in a little more than they
should or I'm not sufficiently careful when</p>
<p t="1489630" d="2040">I enter into a relationship with people.</p>
<p t="1491670" d="1470">Or I don't treat people right.</p>
<p t="1493140" d="3200">Or I don't have a good conceptualization of
myself.</p>
<p t="1496340" d="2800">Or I'm chasing after the wrong person.</p>
<p t="1499140" d="2160">Well that's all gonna be very annoying to
learn.</p>
<p t="1501300" d="2090">But if you don't learn it you're gonna be
in big trouble.</p>
<p t="1503390" d="4940">So maybe the best thing to do when an anomaly
of that sort hits you is to think okay, yeah,</p>
<p t="1508330" d="1010">it's a dragon.</p>
<p t="1509340" d="1950">No doubt it will eat me.</p>
<p t="1511290" d="3250">But if I don't let it eat me then there'll
just be another one waiting around the corner</p>
<p t="1514540" d="1540">and it'll probably be a little bit bigger.</p>
<p t="1516080" d="3880">And if I get eaten by enough of them, I'm
not really gonna wanna be around much.</p>
<p t="1519960" d="3270">And maybe I'm not gonna be willing to help
other people be around much either.</p>
<p t="1523230" d="5180">Doesn't seem like a very good alternative
to me.</p>
<p t="1528410" d="9740">So back in 1957, some new Gnostic writings
were discovered in a, in a cave.</p>
<p t="1538150" d="5510">They were discovered by these two Arab guys
who went out to kill the man who killed their</p>
<p t="1543660" d="1000">father.</p>
<p t="1544660" d="1370">They took him out into this cave and they
killed him.</p>
<p t="1546030" d="4900">And when they were burying him they found
these amphora full of papers and papyrus.</p>
<p t="1550930" d="1000">And they took them home.</p>
<p t="1551930" d="3150">And their mother used a bunch of them to light
cooking fires with.</p>
<p t="1555080" d="3570">And one day one of their friends who was an
antiquities dealer showed up.</p>
<p t="1558650" d="2380">And he said you know you shouldn't be burning
those.</p>
<p t="1561030" d="2600">Those are about fifteen hundred years old.</p>
<p t="1563630" d="5000">And they look like very early Gnostic gospels
And the Gnostics were this branch of Christianity</p>
<p t="1568630" d="4330">that was pretty violently suppressed by the

<p t="1572960" d="5600">And the Gnostics believed that faith was a
good thing but knowledge was all right too.</p>
<p t="1578560" d="7090">And they wrote gospel accounts say of Christ's
