<p t="340" d="4580">On Wednesday the 31st of January at 7:30 p.m.</p>
<p t="5040" d="4280">I'm going to be speaking about my new book and its</p>
<p t="9600" d="3600">Genesis at the lovely Orpheum Theatre in Los Angeles</p>
<p t="13720" d="3320">and so I'd like to invite you to attend.</p>
<p t="17040" d="3780">I'll talk for about an hour and a half or so perhaps two.</p>
<p t="21040" d="4010">Take questions from the audience and then sign and dedicate books</p>
<p t="25050" d="3930">and so if you'd be interested in hearing about twelve rules for life and</p>
<p t="29140" d="4080">About how it came about, and what it's about, and why,</p>
<p t="33220" d="3820">then please come to the theater and we'll have a fine time</p>
<p t="37080" d="2500">So looking forward to seeing you there</p>
<p t="42240" d="3800">Twelve rules for life is about how to live properly in the face of</p>
<p t="46360" d="2800">vulnerability and tragedy and malevolence</p>
<p t="49800" d="2000">one of the</p>
<p t="51840" d="3220">Propositions in twelve rules for life is that; Life,</p>
<p t="55900" d="4460">existence is, usefully characterized as an interplay of order</p>
<p t="60380" d="4960">and chaos, or unknown and known. You're always striving to balance those two if</p>
<p t="65820" d="2860">If what you what you're doing is too familiar you're bored</p>
<p t="68700" d="3860">and if what you're doing is too unfamiliar then you're anxious</p>
<p t="72560" d="3360">and what you want to do is find the</p>
<p t="76140" d="2800">Harmonious line between those two and that's signified by</p>
<p t="78960" d="4340">Meaning, if you can get those two things right then you can have your cake and eat it too.</p>
<p t="84600" d="3300">I hope people can take away the idea that there is a</p>
<p t="87920" d="6660">mode of being in the face of the vulnerability and tragedy of life that is</p>
<p t="95160" d="1620">noble and</p>
<p t="96790" d="1530">powerful and</p>
<p t="98320" d="6650">capable of sustaining them through the worst possible times without becoming corrupt and bitter</p>
