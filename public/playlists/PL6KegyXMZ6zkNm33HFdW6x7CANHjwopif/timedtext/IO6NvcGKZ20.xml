<p t="1170" d="7840">Okay, so there were a couple of things that
I wanted to tell you that were left open in</p>
<p t="9010" d="1810">the last lecture.</p>
<p t="10820" d="3440">The first one was that I told you that there
were two types of games and then I only told</p>
<p t="14260" d="5150">you about one type of game, so I know you've
all been dying of curiosity about that ever</p>
<p t="19410" d="1020">since.</p>
<p t="20430" d="5510">So, the first type of game that we talked
about was the one where every one has a particularly</p>
<p t="25940" d="1000">shared goal.</p>
<p t="26940" d="2339">You might of that as a structured game.</p>
<p t="29279" d="4751">But the second type of game that Piaget was
interested in was dramatic or pretend play</p>
<p t="34030" d="1000">games.</p>
<p t="35030" d="7369">And generally how a pretend play episodes
works is that—well a child can always do</p>
<p t="42399" d="4180">this by him or herself—but if it's a group
game usually what happens is the kids get</p>
<p t="46579" d="4710">together in a little group and they basically
script out a little play.</p>
<p t="51289" d="3131">And its like—what might you call it?</p>
<p t="54420" d="2389">Spontaneous improvisation.</p>
<p t="56809" d="4500">You know, and so maybe they'll play house
and they'll assign, you know, a player to</p>
<p t="61309" d="5350">each role and I guess that would normally
be mother and father and baby, often, and</p>
<p t="66659" d="2000">maybe pet—dog or cat.</p>
<p t="68659" d="4170">So, you know, you can be the cat and you can
be the mom and you can be the dad.</p>
<p t="72829" d="3951">And then they'll set up a little dramatic
arena.</p>
<p t="76780" d="4479">Maybe it's a, you know, like a table covered
with blankets, which kids seem to particularly</p>
<p t="81259" d="3360">like and then they'll run through the game.</p>
<p t="84619" d="5581">Now, and in some sense what they're doing
is imitating their parents or maybe their</p>
<p t="90200" d="4879">pet or maybe the baby, but it's not exactly
imitation, and this is an important thing</p>
<p t="95079" d="5801">to note, because imitation would imply—if
you're imitating someone what you're in</p>
<p t="100880" d="2720">sense doing is duplicating what they just
did.</p>
<p t="103600" d="1860">Now there are robots, for example, now.</p>
<p t="105460" d="4799">If you want to teach the robot how to do something,
so maybe the robot's got an arm—in fact</p>
<p t="110259" d="8941">it does—you can grab it's arm and you
can go like this.</p>
<p t="119200" d="4689">And then as long as you pt can there, the
robot will do exactly that, precisely that.</p>
<p t="123889" d="5461">So you're teaching it—it has the capability
of imitating movements that it's already</p>
<p t="129350" d="1000">done once.</p>
<p t="130350" d="3551">But, you know, when you're a kid and you're
playing house and maybe you're being the</p>
<p t="133901" d="5779">mother, you don't precisely duplicate with
your body exactly the movements that you saw</p>
<p t="139680" d="4919">your mother make maybe the last time you saw
her or the last time you were watching her.</p>
<p t="144599" d="4841">What you seem to be able to do instead is
to watch your mother over long periods of</p>
<p t="149440" d="5200">time and extract out something that you might
describe as her spirit.</p>
<p t="154640" d="5440">And I know that that's not really a psychological
or a scientific word but it's a useful word</p>
<p t="160080" d="5470">because—or you could perhaps say her personality
but it's not her personality exactly because</p>
<p t="165550" d="4000">it's her personality as mother, which isn't
really her personality.</p>
<p t="169550" d="6040">It's the Mother personality and that Mother
personality is something that has been practiced</p>
<p t="175590" d="3380">by mothers for who knows how long.</p>
<p t="178970" d="6620">And what the child seems to do when she, we'll
say for this example, is watching her mother</p>
<p t="185590" d="5250">is extract out what the spirit of motherhood
is and then embody that, right?</p>
<p t="190840" d="5090">And so you might think of the spirit of motherhood
as those elements of behavior and perception</p>
<p t="195930" d="8700">and emotion and cognition, for that matter—but
it's all of those embodied simultaneously—what's</p>
<p t="204630" d="5120">in common across all the instances of acting
like a mother.</p>
<p t="209750" d="4409">You know, so you can say, “Well, that's
mother-like behavior,” and who knows what</p>
<p t="214159" d="1000">that might be.</p>
<p t="215159" d="5711">I mean, what you want to do is conjure up
the stereotype roughly speaking of the mother.</p>
<p t="220870" d="4610">You know, people don't really like stereotypes,
especially in psychology, but almost all your</p>
<p t="225480" d="3750">thinking is in stereotypes so there's not
much difference between a stereotype and a</p>
<p t="229230" d="2910">category, you know.</p>
<p t="232140" d="2679">Categories are oversimplifications and so
are stereotypes.</p>
<p t="234819" d="4991">But anyways, so you take—imagine the stereotype
of a mother and then the child is acting that</p>
<p t="239810" d="1000">out.</p>
<p t="240810" d="3830">And what they're trying to do is to become
the mother roughly speaking.</p>
<p t="244640" d="1909">So, and why?</p>
<p t="246549" d="1341">Well, for obvious reasons.</p>
<p t="247890" d="2390">There are obvious reasons why someone would
do that.</p>
<p t="250280" d="3870">It's because without mothers there wouldn't
be any human beings and so if we didn't</p>
<p t="254150" d="3330">have successful mothers that would be the
end of us and so we wouldn't be here to</p>
<p t="257480" d="1460">talk about it.</p>
<p t="258940" d="5640">So, now one of the things that Piaget observed
was that this kind of dramatic play was extraordinarily</p>
<p t="264580" d="5140">important to children because it helped them
learn how to act like they would act maybe</p>
<p t="269720" d="3630">when they're older children or maybe when
they're teenagers or maybe when they're</p>
<p t="273350" d="1000">young adults.</p>
<p t="274350" d="7080">It's a trial run in a relatively safe environment.</p>
<p t="281430" d="3850">One of the things I've been thinking about,
it's not that easy to precisely specify</p>
<p t="285280" d="3110">the role of the father, but I really believe
that one of the things that fathers do, if</p>
<p t="288390" d="4630">they do a good job of being fathers, is that
they circumscribe a safe space within the</p>
<p t="293020" d="7450">house or within the familial environment where
the children can play free of interference.</p>
<p t="300470" d="9761">And so then because play is also a very sensitive
behavior, by which I mean that it's easy</p>
<p t="310231" d="1539">to disrupt play in children.</p>
<p t="311770" d="2450">If there's anything wrong with the child
they won't play.</p>
<p t="314220" d="3810">So one of the ways that you can tell if your
child is doing well is that they're playing.</p>
<p t="318030" d="3540">I mean I suppose you could say the same thing
about your dog or maybe even your partner.</p>
<p t="321570" d="5040">You know, if they're in a playful mood then
perhaps there isn't anything particularly</p>
<p t="326610" d="5230">wrong with the relationship at the moment
and all the needs that might be regarded in</p>
<p t="331840" d="2280">some sense as more fundamental have been met.</p>
<p t="334120" d="3890">And so to get children to play well you have
to circumscribe a safe area and they have</p>
<p t="338010" d="1310">to be taken care of.</p>
<p t="339320" d="4390">And then they can experiment with different
modes of being, and they do that by themselves</p>
<p t="343710" d="2140">but they also do that in the company of other
children.</p>
<p t="345850" d="4150">And obviously what they're doing is practicing
for later roles.</p>
<p t="350000" d="5110">And, you know, you see this sort of thing
in children at multiple levels because not</p>
<p t="355110" d="5360">only will they play out being a parent—that's
a very common element of child's play—but</p>
<p t="360470" d="6040">they'll also often develop sort of fixations
on slightly older children, maybe a year older</p>
<p t="366510" d="6100">or two years older, and sort of hero worship
them and follow them around and imitate them</p>
<p t="372610" d="3120">even more directly than they might imitate
a parent.</p>
<p t="375730" d="3750">Now obviously the child has his or her reasons
for that and the reasons are is they're</p>
<p t="379480" d="4180">trying to advance to the next stage, so they
scan the environment; look for something who</p>
<p t="383660" d="5830">seems to have done that well, whatever that
means, who looks competent and is maybe friendly</p>
<p t="389490" d="6090">and can tolerate having a, you know, kid trail
along behind them; and they act them out.</p>
<p t="395580" d="6010">And so play, all the forms of play that we
described—the two basic forms—are extremely</p>
<p t="401590" d="1080">important to children.</p>
<p t="402670" d="5550">And when you see them pretending, as a parent,
one of the things that you should realize</p>
<p t="408220" d="4790">is that it's an extraordinarily important
form of activity; it's how they socialize</p>
<p t="413010" d="1250">themselves.</p>
<p t="414260" d="6610">Now, the other thing that I didn't mention—this
is concentrating on Piaget as well—is, you</p>
<p t="420870" d="6230">know, we talked a little bit in the mythological
and shamanic initiation lectures about the</p>
<p t="427100" d="6420">idea that human personality evolution is a
punctuated, upward development.</p>
<p t="433520" d="6330">So you move ahead and then you encounter something
that gets in your way, some sort of severe</p>
<p t="439850" d="5080">obstacle, and it either blocks you behaviorally
so that you can't get to your goal using</p>
<p t="444930" d="4390">your current behavioral plans or it's even
more complex than that and it disrupts the</p>
<p t="449320" d="6390">whole structure that you're using to integrate
your behavior across time.</p>
<p t="455710" d="3620">You know, so the difference between that would
be roughly the difference between say going</p>
<p t="459330" d="5280">home to your partner or going on a date with
our partner, assuming people still do such</p>
<p t="464610" d="5410">things, going out with your partner and them
being in an irritable mood.</p>
<p t="470020" d="3760">And so what that would mean is maybe you smile
at them or you tell them a joke and, you know,</p>
<p t="473780" d="3970">it falls flat or that respond in an angry
manner and so you're going to orient to</p>
<p t="477750" d="3050">that; it's going to things fall apart a
little bit; you might say, “Oh, the whole</p>
<p t="480800" d="1000">night's ruined.”</p>
<p t="481800" d="3990">You probably don't say the whole relationship
has had it, but if that happens enough times</p>
<p t="485790" d="1000">you might.</p>
<p t="486790" d="3810">But you might say, “Oh, the whole night's
ruined,” or maybe you'll—which is probably</p>
<p t="490600" d="2300">a bit of an overreaction right off the bat.</p>
<p t="492900" d="4890">Like my impression as a clinician is that
when people are being difficult to get along</p>
<p t="497790" d="5370">with you should let them do it three times
while you track it, because then the third</p>
<p t="503160" d="3050">time they do it you can say, “Look you've
done this.</p>
<p t="506210" d="1000">Here's what you're doing.”</p>
<p t="507210" d="2700">And they say, “No, I'm not doing that,”
and you say, “Ha!</p>
<p t="509910" d="4879">Yes you are because I saw you do it then and
then, and then.”</p>
<p t="514789" d="3110">And then they're basically screwed; you
win right away if you do that.</p>
<p t="517899" d="8211">So, but more seriously, if it's just one
little episode it's best to let it go.</p>
<p t="526110" d="4080">You don't really have any proof and maybe
there's just some, you know, local thing</p>
<p t="530190" d="1000">wrong.</p>
<p t="531190" d="3149">Three times, that's a whole different issue
because then you've got some credibility</p>
<p t="534339" d="3940">and it's a nice balance between being too
impulsively reactive—you know, because you</p>
<p t="538279" d="1571">should stand up for yourself, right?</p>
<p t="539850" d="2979">Well, does that mean that you should respond
to every little slight?</p>
<p t="542829" d="3440">Well, you're going to be reacting all the
time if you do that, but you don't want</p>
<p t="546269" d="2070">to be a pushover and let people walk all over
you.</p>
<p t="548339" d="5541">So you have to find some balance between being
tolerant, so you don't have unnecessary</p>
<p t="553880" d="4640">fights, and being tough so that you don't
have unnecessary fights, and three is a nice</p>
<p t="558520" d="1000">number.</p>
<p t="559520" d="5340">Anyways, so you're out with your partner
and they're being annoying and, you know,</p>
<p t="564860" d="2640">you can reconstruct your behavior.</p>
<p t="567500" d="4149">Maybe instead of telling jokes you look at
your phone and let them calm down or something</p>
<p t="571649" d="1000">like that.</p>
<p t="572649" d="3931">You haven't disrupted much of the frame
that you're using to interact with, right?</p>
<p t="576580" d="4840">The night, the evening, is still continuing
in it's planned manner; you can still use</p>
<p t="581420" d="3120">the perceptual structures and the expectations
that were guiding you.</p>
<p t="584540" d="4940">They were modified at a very high resolution,
minor level.</p>
<p t="589480" d="3570">And then, so that's going to upset you a
little bit because you're going to think,</p>
<p t="593050" d="1060">you know, “What's going on here?”</p>
<p t="594110" d="3729">Maybe you'll think, “Is there something
wrong with me?”—if you're self-conscious</p>
<p t="597839" d="2531">you'll do that—or maybe you'll think
that there's something wrong with them.</p>
<p t="600370" d="1000">Whatever.</p>
<p t="601370" d="1769">But it's not that serious.</p>
<p t="603139" d="7500">But then, you know, maybe you're out with
your partner and, you know, some person wanders</p>
<p t="610639" d="4611">over—you're in a restaurant—some person
wanders over to the table and says, “Hello,”</p>
<p t="615250" d="1139">to your partner.</p>
<p t="616389" d="2630">“I didn't know that you had a girlfriend
or boyfriend.</p>
<p t="619019" d="3701">You, you know, you didn't tell me that when
we went out last week.”</p>
<p t="622720" d="2070">Well that's going to be a whole different
scenario.</p>
<p t="624790" d="4849">Right yeah, and you all laugh about that because
you know perfectly well that it's a different</p>
<p t="629639" d="1000">scenario.</p>
<p t="630639" d="4721">Right, and you might say, “Well, why is
the one scenario more disrupting than the</p>
<p t="635360" d="6320">other?” and the answer to that is something
like: if your presuppositions about the world</p>
<p t="641680" d="5340">are arranged in a hierarchy, in a sense, so
that the little actions that you take to do</p>
<p t="647020" d="5729">something are at the very bottom of the hierarchy,
or they're the micro-details, and then you</p>
<p t="652749" d="4231">continue to abstract up all the way to the
top, which might be, “I'm in a committed</p>
<p t="656980" d="4520">relationship”—now there are levels of
hierarchy going from being in a committed</p>
<p t="661500" d="4519">relationship to the little actions that you
undertake with one another—the higher up</p>
<p t="666019" d="6451">you have to go in the hierarchy, the higher
up the disruption occurs in the hierarchical</p>
<p t="672470" d="3080">level, the more upset you're going to be.</p>
<p t="675550" d="6660">So irritable partner, well you can sort of
walk around that; unfaithful partner, well,</p>
<p t="682210" d="3689">you know, that's pretty much up at the top
of the hierarchy where you have to start rethinking</p>
<p t="685899" d="4331">your past and your present and your future,
and maybe you are and who they are and who</p>
<p t="690230" d="4620">men are and who women are, and it's like,
it's really a disaster, right?</p>
<p t="694850" d="1000">Everything falls apart.</p>
<p t="695850" d="2859">Well, then that's the little trip to the
underworld that we talked about.</p>
<p t="698709" d="5351">Now Piaget had an idea like that also with
regards to children, because his stage theory</p>
<p t="704060" d="1509">is a punctuated theory.</p>
<p t="705569" d="6060">One of the things he noted about children
was that they would construct a structure</p>
<p t="711629" d="6760">and a structure would be—I think again the
best way to think about it as is a personality</p>
<p t="718389" d="4311">because a personality has thoughts and emotions
and motivations and actions; it's all of</p>
<p t="722700" d="1000">those at the same time.</p>
<p t="723700" d="6160">It's this little alive subelement of you,
and children are conjuring up these little</p>
<p t="729860" d="6050">subelements of themselves that have functional
utility, as they build themselves from their</p>
<p t="735910" d="9630">motor systems upwards, and now and then they
run into a situation where the tools that</p>
<p t="745540" d="4060">they've built—the subpersonalities that
they've built—aren't fulfilling the</p>
<p t="749600" d="1000">desired function.</p>
<p t="750600" d="6010">So maybe that'll happen when, you know,
a three-year-old goes to kindergarten and</p>
<p t="756610" d="3599">isn't making friends easily.</p>
<p t="760209" d="4951">Well that's going to be—a child's going
to come home after that and cry, fall apart,</p>
<p t="765160" d="2980">and maybe be angry, and tell their parents,
“No one would play with me.”</p>
<p t="768140" d="2960">And, you know, they'll breakdown; they'll
have tears.</p>
<p t="771100" d="3640">And it's almost as if they switch from a
domain where they're competent.</p>
<p t="774740" d="4490">Like, emotion signifies, especially negative
emotion, signifies that you've moved from</p>
<p t="779230" d="4710">the domain in which you're competent to
the domain in which you're not competent,</p>
<p t="783940" d="4399">and if you're crying, for example, then
that's often a distress signal.</p>
<p t="788339" d="4851">Sometimes it's anger but it's often a
distress signal and it means, “I've ended</p>
<p t="793190" d="4939">up in a situation where what I know is no
longer sufficient to produce the outcomes</p>
<p t="798129" d="1281">that I desire.”</p>
<p t="799410" d="1450">So you cry and then you get help.</p>
<p t="800860" d="3500">People come and say, “Well, what's the
matter?” and they give you a little bat.</p>
<p t="804360" d="5139">And, you know, and they console you and maybe
they help you strategize about what you could</p>
<p t="809499" d="2820">do to make the situation better or how you
could act.</p>
<p t="812319" d="5020">Or, if you're a smart parent, maybe you
play with your child and offer them—you</p>
<p t="817339" d="3161">know, and upgrade their ability to interact
socially.</p>
<p t="820500" d="4220">Or you take them on additional play-dates
or whatever and monitor their behavior and</p>
<p t="824720" d="8089">help them reconstruct their little subpersonalities
and bring in more information so that it's</p>
<p t="832809" d="1000">more sophisticated.</p>
<p t="833809" d="5390">So that would be the Piagetian—so this is
a combination of the Piagetian ideas of the</p>
<p t="839199" d="4880">Stage Theory, which is movement upward with
a punctuation, and that's the confusion</p>
<p t="844079" d="4603">because the previous structure is no longer
well-adapted to the world; and then the idea</p>
<p t="848682" d="2058">of assimilation and accommodation.</p>
<p t="850740" d="6490">Now Piaget kind of made assimilation and accommodation,
in a sense, opposites, and it's not exactly.</p>
<p t="857230" d="1609">It's hard to figure out.</p>
<p t="858839" d="5451">But assimilation, for Piaget, is when you
pull information in and the structure—the</p>
<p t="864290" d="3489">internal structure that you're pulling it
into—doesn't really have to change that</p>
<p t="867779" d="1521">much.</p>
<p t="869300" d="4670">And accommodation is when you pull in a fairly
mighty piece of information, often negative,</p>
<p t="873970" d="4099">and it's so disruptive that the structure
that you're using to understand the information</p>
<p t="878069" d="1800">has to be reconstructed.</p>
<p t="879869" d="5791">Now, Piaget thinks of assimilation or accommodation,
but I think it's much easier to think about</p>
<p t="885660" d="5849">it on a continuum with the assimilation occurring
at the level of micro-behaviors.</p>
<p t="891509" d="3841">You know, like if you're trying to pick
up a fork, you know, and maybe your hand's</p>
<p t="895350" d="4450">numb, you try to pick up a fork and it doesn't
work a couple times then you just change your</p>
<p t="899800" d="1010">grip and pick it up.</p>
<p t="900810" d="1250">Like it's a little annoying.</p>
<p t="902060" d="4240">You're going to look at the fork and you're
going to try a couple of routines to pick</p>
<p t="906300" d="4279">it up but, you know, it's not going to bring
your whole damn world to a halt.</p>
<p t="910579" d="3261">You know, so whereas if you find a dead mouse
in your soup, well that's going to be a</p>
<p t="913840" d="3219">whole different story, and again it's a
hierarchical issue.</p>
<p t="917059" d="5200">And so at the bottom, near the motor structures,
I would say it's easy to assimilate; you</p>
<p t="922259" d="6930">just have to make minor changes to the—I
like to think about them as maps really; they're</p>
<p t="929189" d="1000">maps or personalities.</p>
<p t="930189" d="4190">I know those don't sound the same but they're
very similar.</p>
<p t="934379" d="4731">Depends on whether the thing needs a little
adjustment or whether you have to toss the</p>
<p t="939110" d="1370">whole thing away and build a new one.</p>
<p t="940480" d="5430">You know, it's the difference between tightening
the lug nuts on your car or buying a new car.</p>
<p t="945910" d="5330">You can see levels of—you can understand
it as levels of difficulty.</p>
<p t="951240" d="5180">Another way of thinking about it—you need
to know this because you need to understand</p>
<p t="956420" d="3800">how it is that you figure out how upset you
should get when something goes wrong.</p>
<p t="960220" d="2230">It's a very very complicated question.</p>
<p t="962450" d="4199">If you wake up with an ache in your side,
how upset should you be?</p>
<p t="966649" d="1540">Well you don't know.</p>
<p t="968189" d="3710">It's like, maybe it's nothing; maybe you're
going to die of cancer in six months.</p>
<p t="971899" d="1301">You don't know.</p>
<p t="973200" d="5000">And so it's not self-evident how people
calibrate their emotions when something goes</p>
<p t="978200" d="4350">wrong because the extent of the thing that
when wrong is not clearly evident.</p>
<p t="982550" d="2000">Your partner's crabby when you go out for
dinner.</p>
<p t="984550" d="2430">Does that mean that you're going to break
up in two weeks?</p>
<p t="986980" d="1880">Well, it might mean that.</p>
<p t="988860" d="3690">So why don't you just flip out right away
because the whole world's coming to an end.</p>
<p t="992550" d="3950">Well, some people do, right, and those would
be people who are higher in negative emotion</p>
<p t="996500" d="1690">or higher in trait neurotism.</p>
<p t="998190" d="6519">Because they're more likely to react as
if a small, potentially small, anomaly or</p>
<p t="1004709" d="5321">uncertainty or threat or discontinuity or
unexpected occurrence is catastrophic, where</p>
<p t="1010030" d="4909">an emotionally stable person, you know, you
might have to say, “I'm breaking up with</p>
<p t="1014939" d="4731">you,” before they're going to, you know,
look upset and maybe even then it's not</p>
<p t="1019670" d="2370">going to bother them that much.</p>
<p t="1022040" d="4240">So you think of the motor hierarchy, you know,
ranging from microbehaviours at the bottom</p>
<p t="1026280" d="4490">to abstractions at the top and then you can
understand how you might compute how upset</p>
<p t="1030770" d="1540">you get when something goes wrong.</p>
<p t="1032310" d="2990">Assume that it's small to begin with.</p>
<p t="1035300" d="1340">Check at that level.</p>
<p t="1036640" d="2640">If you can't fix it at that level advance
one level up.</p>
<p t="1039280" d="2710">If your car doesn't work you don't buy
a new one.</p>
<p t="1041990" d="5131">The first thing you do is maybe see if the
battery is dead, right, because that's the</p>
<p t="1047121" d="3709">path that you could take that would cause
you the least amount of trouble.</p>
<p t="1050830" d="4700">And it's a really good schema for mental
hygiene.</p>
<p t="1055530" d="1740">It's like Occam's razor.</p>
<p t="1057270" d="2050">You know Occams razor in science, right?</p>
<p t="1059320" d="2260">Does everybody know what Occam's razor is?</p>
<p t="1061580" d="2500">How many people know what Occam's razor
is?</p>
<p t="1064080" d="2010">Okay, how many people don't know?</p>
<p t="1066090" d="1660">Oh, that's amazing.</p>
<p t="1067750" d="1110">It's amazing.</p>
<p t="1068860" d="1570">Okay, well you should know.</p>
<p t="1070430" d="1820">It's really too bad that you don't know.</p>
<p t="1072250" d="2710">It's undoubtedly no reflection on you.</p>
<p t="1074960" d="10690">Anyways, Occam's razor is a phrase referring
to a principal that was established by an</p>
<p t="1085650" d="7730">ancient thinker, Occam, and he said, “Does
not multiply your explanatory principles beyond</p>
<p t="1093380" d="1000">necessity.”</p>
<p t="1094380" d="4610">Okay and so what he meant was: If you have
six reasons why something might have gone</p>
<p t="1098990" d="8170">wrong and you can rank-order them in terms
of complexity, pick the simplest one and then</p>
<p t="1107160" d="4580">until you disprove that stick with it and
then go to the next simplest one and so on.</p>
<p t="1111740" d="9280">And it's often used as a guiding principle
in science where the idea is if you have a</p>
<p t="1121020" d="4520">simple explanation, don't complicate it
up with a bunch of unnecessary assumptions.</p>
<p t="1125540" d="8950">And it also might be reflective of a deeper
underlying truth, which is that it's unlikely</p>
<p t="1134490" d="6180">for any set of entities to be in any particular
configuration, but it's particularly unlikely</p>
<p t="1140670" d="4420">for them to be in an unlikely and complex
configuration.</p>
<p t="1145090" d="4490">So anyways, so hopefully that's understandable.</p>
<p t="1149580" d="2310">You can tangle all those ideas together.</p>
<p t="1151890" d="5390">At the bottom of your personality hierarchy
there are actions; at the top there are abstractions—moral</p>
<p t="1157280" d="2640">abstractions like, “Be a good person”.</p>
<p t="1159920" d="4370">When you run into something that's unexpected,
the amount you get upset is proportionate</p>
<p t="1164290" d="3270">to the level in the hierarchy where the damage
appears to be taking place.</p>
<p t="1167560" d="5110">Now you kind of have to guess at that and
partially you do that with your temperament—so</p>
<p t="1172670" d="4130">if you're high in neruroticism you guess
catastrophe and if it's low in neuroticism</p>
<p t="1176800" d="3990">you guess irrelevant—and you do that partly
because of the way that you perceive your</p>
<p t="1180790" d="5780">own competence—you know, because if you've
encountered minor to major problems in the</p>
<p t="1186570" d="4560">past, say even if you're a nervous person,
and you've solved them you might've learned,</p>
<p t="1191130" d="3880">“Well yeah, it's a problem but I can fix
problems so it's not really a problem,”</p>
<p t="1195010" d="2330">which is a really good way to think of yourself.</p>
<p t="1197340" d="4820">You know, that's a much better way to think
of yourself than, “I'm a person with no</p>
<p t="1202160" d="1000">problems.”</p>
<p t="1203160" d="1000">It's like, good luck with that.</p>
<p t="1204160" d="3980">But, “I'm a person who could successfully
address problems if I concentrated on them”:</p>
<p t="1208140" d="2080">that's very very useful.</p>
<p t="1210220" d="5720">And then the other way that your nervous system
sort of decides how upset you should get when</p>
<p t="1215940" d="3440">something happens is by looking at how other
people treat you.</p>
<p t="1219380" d="4610">And if they treat you like you're competent
then your nervous system gets less neurotic.</p>
<p t="1223990" d="2210">That's a good way of thinking about it.</p>
<p t="1226200" d="6320">You produce more serotonin, you react less
globally to indications of error.</p>
<p t="1232520" d="3680">Okay, so anyways so Piaget: he's talks about
assimilation.</p>
<p t="1236200" d="4130">Assimilation is when you have to make a little
change and accommodation is when the whole</p>
<p t="1240330" d="5910">damn structure has to be reconfigured, and
he thought about those, in some sense, as</p>
<p t="1246240" d="5340">separate types of learning, but they're
not; they're on a continuum from very simple</p>
<p t="1251580" d="1460">to very complex.</p>
<p t="1253040" d="3860">Have any of you ever heard of the idea of
a paradigm shift?</p>
<p t="1256900" d="2330">How many people have heard of that?</p>
<p t="1259230" d="1650">Okay, how many people haven't?</p>
<p t="1260880" d="3250">Alright, do you know the name Thomas Kuhn?</p>
<p t="1264130" d="1100">Anybody?</p>
<p t="1265230" d="9780">No, okay well Thomas Coon was a philosopher
of science and he wrote a book in 1962 called</p>
<p t="1275010" d="5580">“The Nature of Scientific Revolutions”,
and Kuhn basically said the same thing about</p>
<p t="1280590" d="6560">the way knowledge structures proceeded as
Piaget said about the progression of knowledge</p>
<p t="1287150" d="1710">structures within the individual.</p>
<p t="1288860" d="5660">So Kuhn was concerned about large-scale transformations
in scientific viewpoint.</p>
<p t="1294520" d="7230">So let me give you an example: so in the late
1890's, physicists were convinced that they</p>
<p t="1301750" d="2540">were just going to have to shut the whole
endeavor down.</p>
<p t="1304290" d="1000">Why?</p>
<p t="1305290" d="3470">Well, because the physicists knew everything
that there was to know.</p>
<p t="1308760" d="6940">There wasn't a single phenomena, at that
point, that physicists could not account for</p>
<p t="1315700" d="4750">except one, and here's the one they couldn't
account for:</p>
<p t="1320450" d="6810">So imagine you're on a train and it's
going that way at half the speed of light.</p>
<p t="1327260" d="6440">And you shine a flashlight—you're standing
on the top of the train, obviously protecting</p>
<p t="1333700" d="5340">yourself against the wind, and you shine a
light going ahead and you measure the speed</p>
<p t="1339040" d="2500">of light out of your flashlight.</p>
<p t="1341540" d="3670">The speed of light is 186 000 miles per second
out of your flashlight.</p>
<p t="1345210" d="5530">Okay, so now you're on the ground and you're
watching this train zip by.</p>
<p t="1350740" d="4860">And the guy's on top of it shining a flashlight
and light comes out of the front of his flashlight</p>
<p t="1355600" d="1620">and you measure the speed of it.</p>
<p t="1357220" d="1800">What's the speed?</p>
<p t="1359020" d="4960">Well, you might think, “Well, obviously
it's the speed of light plus half the speed</p>
<p t="1363980" d="3300">of light because the train is going half the
speed of light and the light is going the</p>
<p t="1367280" d="1000">speed of light.</p>
<p t="1368280" d="5220">And so the light coming from the combination
of the train and the light is the speed of</p>
<p t="1373500" d="3280">light plus half the speed of light; that's
what would happen if someone was throwing</p>
<p t="1376780" d="1150">a ball, right?”</p>
<p t="1377930" d="1540">But that isn't right.</p>
<p t="1379470" d="3210">What happens is it's the speed of light
and no matter how fast you're going when</p>
<p t="1382680" d="4970">you shine your flashlight out, the light coming
out of your flashlight is going to be going</p>
<p t="1387650" d="4650">exactly 186 000 miles an hour—I mean a second.</p>
<p t="1392300" d="1000">A second, sorry.</p>
<p t="1393300" d="1000">186 000 miles a second.</p>
<p t="1394300" d="1000">It's not additive.</p>
<p t="1395300" d="3730">And so if you're on the train and you're
going backwards and you're shining you're</p>
<p t="1399030" d="3850">light, and the person measures it, it's
not the speed of light minus half the speed</p>
<p t="1402880" d="3830">of light, which is what it would be if your
were throwing a ball.</p>
<p t="1406710" d="1670">It's the speed of light.</p>
<p t="1408380" d="2980">Well, nobody knew how the hell to account
for that.</p>
<p t="1411360" d="3080">It's like, that just made no sense at all
but everyone was ignoring it.</p>
<p t="1414440" d="6250">Well, it turns out you can't ignore that
and that wasn't the only thing that wasn't</p>
<p t="1420690" d="4170">quite well-laid out at the end of the nineteenth
century from the perspective of physics, but</p>
<p t="1424860" d="1110">it was a big one.</p>
<p t="1425970" d="5660">And to solve that Newtonian physics had to
be completely overthrown and quantum physics</p>
<p t="1431630" d="1000">put in its place.</p>
<p t="1432630" d="4860">And quantum physics is—quantum physics,
you might think of it as a box like this and</p>
<p t="1437490" d="3700">inside that there's a box that says Newtonian
physics.</p>
<p t="1441190" d="3840">And so quantum physics can explain everything
that Newtonian physics can explain but it</p>
<p t="1445030" d="4440">explains some more things beside, and so you
would say, because of the, it's a better</p>
<p t="1449470" d="1000">theory.</p>
<p t="1450470" d="4270">Now, I might say, “Well, you've just made
a personality transformation.</p>
<p t="1454740" d="3650">Are you a better person than you were before?”
and you might say, “Well, how in the world</p>
<p t="1458390" d="1360">can you make a judgment like that?”</p>
<p t="1459750" d="3820">And I would say, “Well, if you're a better
personality you can do all the things you</p>
<p t="1463570" d="3920">could do before, just as well or maybe even
a little better, plus there's a bunch of</p>
<p t="1467490" d="1590">new things you could do.</p>
<p t="1469080" d="2030">That's a better personality.”</p>
<p t="1471110" d="4370">It's another interesting example of how
the idea of better, which really is a moral</p>
<p t="1475480" d="4450">idea in some sense, better versus worse, you
can conceptualize it—well, this is one of</p>
<p t="1479930" d="4780">the things that Piaget is really really useful
for, because it gives you a language that's</p>
<p t="1484710" d="4710">grounded in observation and in science to
start to handle questions that start to border</p>
<p t="1489420" d="1090">on the moral.</p>
<p t="1490510" d="4320">So a better personality can do more than the
previous personality could, and you certainly</p>
<p t="1494830" d="2520">see how that would be applicable to your life.</p>
<p t="1497350" d="6340">And one of the things I would suggest as a
consequence to that is: you know, people always</p>
<p t="1503690" d="3680">compare themselves to other people, and generally
what you do is you compare yourself—you</p>
<p t="1507370" d="3030">make a little dominance hierarchy out of the
people that are right around you.</p>
<p t="1510400" d="4700">And this is a very annoying propensity because
what it means is that no matter how successful</p>
<p t="1515100" d="3780">you get in your life you're still going
to be in the middle of the dominance hierarchy.</p>
<p t="1518880" d="4710">So you'll end up, I don't know maybe you'll
end up—God I don't know—maybe you're</p>
<p t="1523590" d="2800">CEO of a hundred million dollar company, let's
say.</p>
<p t="1526390" d="4120">Well, you'd go hang out with a bunch of
CEOs and there are ten of them.</p>
<p t="1530510" d="2330">Three of them are CEOs of a two billion dollar
company.</p>
<p t="1532840" d="3510">It's like, you're a pretty little CEO
among those people, but who are you going</p>
<p t="1536350" d="1670">to be comparing yourself to?</p>
<p t="1538020" d="1570">The guys who pick up your trash?</p>
<p t="1539590" d="1230">It's like no.</p>
<p t="1540820" d="3860">You could but you won't; you'll have your
little group around you and you'll be somewhere</p>
<p t="1544680" d="1000">in the middle.</p>
<p t="1545680" d="4760">And so that's useful to know because that
means that what you have to learn to cope</p>
<p t="1550440" d="3160">with is the fact that you're going to be
somewhere in the middle.</p>
<p t="1553600" d="3310">And then you might say, “Well, how do you
cope with that because you should be improving</p>
<p t="1556910" d="2020">and you also want to be very good at something?”</p>
<p t="1558930" d="4400">Well, I think the best way to do that, and
this is especially true when you're older,</p>
<p t="1563330" d="3610">is that you don't compare yourself to other
people; you compare yourself to the previous</p>
<p t="1566940" d="1000">version of you.</p>
<p t="1567940" d="4780">It's a good control, right, because you'll
see, especially by the time you're about</p>
<p t="1572720" d="6660">thirty, when you're young you have to compare
yourself to other people because when you're</p>
<p t="1579380" d="4020">young you're a lot like all other people,
in some sense, but by the time you're thirty</p>
<p t="1583400" d="2490">or older you're not very much like other
people at all.</p>
<p t="1585890" d="4260">And so, you know, because the conditions of
your life start to become so unique and specific</p>
<p t="1590150" d="1379">to you.</p>
<p t="1591529" d="3381">Well then comparing yourself to other people
isn't very helpful, but comparing yourself</p>
<p t="1594910" d="4240">to who you were before: that's really helpful
and you can keep doing that your whole life.</p>
<p t="1599150" d="7560">And it's a fair game, right, because the
previous you had all the problems and all</p>
<p t="1606710" d="5670">the opportunities and positive attributes
that you have.</p>
<p t="1612380" d="6630">It's fair; it's a fair game and it'll
save you an awful lot of misery.</p>
<p t="1619010" d="10310">So, alright so Piaget outlined different forms
of games and he talked about different ways</p>
<p t="1629320" d="1760">that those aided in socializations.</p>
<p t="1631080" d="5730">And you can understand that—I use this “meta”
idea, which was the hierarchy of personality,</p>
<p t="1636810" d="2270">to sort of explain that.</p>
<p t="1639080" d="4680">From a Piagetian perspective, you put yourself
together from your body upward toward increased</p>
<p t="1643760" d="5310">abstractions, and as you do that you can do
more things with your body but you can also</p>
<p t="1649070" d="5260">do more complex things integrating those things
that your do with your body across time and</p>
<p t="1654330" d="2120">with increasing numbers of other people.</p>
<p t="1656450" d="6530">Now, Piaget has this really cool idea about
what constitutes reality as a consequence</p>
<p t="1662980" d="1000">of that.</p>
<p t="1663980" d="5410">So he would say: Alright, so let's say you
can choose Game A or you can choose Game B</p>
<p t="1669390" d="3550">and you might say, “Well, I want to figure
out whether Game A or Game B is a better game</p>
<p t="1672940" d="3120">because if I'm going to play a game it might
as well be a better game.”</p>
<p t="1676060" d="4550">And he would say, “Okay, so here's how
you can figure out if the game you're playing</p>
<p t="1680610" d="4250">is a good one: it's good for you.</p>
<p t="1684860" d="1130">Now.</p>
<p t="1685990" d="6070">It's good for you now, next week, next month,
next year, and ten years from now.</p>
<p t="1692060" d="4350">So not only is it good for you now, but if
you play it repeatedly things get better for</p>
<p t="1696410" d="1000">you.”</p>
<p t="1697410" d="2900">Okay, so that's a game where you're taking
the future into account.</p>
<p t="1700310" d="1870">It's not an impulsive game.</p>
<p t="1702180" d="6530">You know, like cocaine is really good for
people for about a day, but over a week or</p>
<p t="1708710" d="3140">six months or five years it's a degenerating
game.</p>
<p t="1711850" d="5950">So, and you can't use your emotion to determine
that because cocaine generally suffuses the</p>
<p t="1717800" d="3980">person who's using it with a sense of power
and possibility.</p>
<p t="1721780" d="4580">So you can't just rely on your emotion,
no more than you can when you're tempted</p>
<p t="1726360" d="3440">to do something impulsive and fun but that
might have negative consequences.</p>
<p t="1729800" d="5060">Okay, so the game should be good now and across
the future.</p>
<p t="1734860" d="2390">And then it should be good for you and it
should be good for you and it should for your</p>
<p t="1737250" d="5340">family and it should be good for your social
community and so forth, as you spiral outward,</p>
<p t="1742590" d="4910">and it should be good for all of those things
across multiple expanses of time.</p>
<p t="1747500" d="2710">And Piaget would call that an “equilibrated
game.”</p>
<p t="1750210" d="5800">Now, there's another additional idea behind
the idea of an equilibrated game which is</p>
<p t="1756010" d="5340">that if I'm playing a game that's good
for me and it's good for you and it's</p>
<p t="1761350" d="3930">good for you and it's good for you, then
we probably will all be willing to play it</p>
<p t="1765280" d="1830">voluntarily.</p>
<p t="1767110" d="5610">And so that's also why Piaget believed that,
in some sense, a game-like structure—let's</p>
<p t="1772720" d="4530">say a social structure—that everybody plays
because they want to is much better than a</p>
<p t="1777250" d="2880">game-like structure where everyone plays because
they have to.</p>
<p t="1780130" d="4290">And so he would say, well that's in part
the technical difference between a tyranny</p>
<p t="1784420" d="1020">and a democracy.</p>
<p t="1785440" d="2910">And it's bloody smart thinking.</p>
<p t="1788350" d="4100">You know, I think Piaget got farther with
that idea than anyone else had ever in history,</p>
<p t="1792450" d="2260">because you can understand—there's this
old idea.</p>
<p t="1794710" d="2240">It was Hume—another philosopher.</p>
<p t="1796950" d="2670">What's his first name?</p>
<p t="1799620" d="1000">Hume.</p>
<p t="1800620" d="1000">David?</p>
<p t="1801620" d="1000">What's that?</p>
<p t="1802620" d="1000">David?</p>
<p t="1803620" d="1000">David!</p>
<p t="1804620" d="3690">Yes, you'd think I could remember that.</p>
<p t="1808310" d="1340">David Hume.</p>
<p t="1809650" d="3920">He has this idea that you can't derive an
“ought” from an “is”.</p>
<p t="1813570" d="4250">So it's another one of those principles,
like Occam's razor, and what it means is</p>
<p t="1817820" d="4020">something like this: No matter how much you
know about something that doesn't mean that</p>
<p t="1821840" d="3240">you can figure out what you should do about
it.</p>
<p t="1825080" d="5350">So here's an example: Let's say, we know
AIDS is a problem, we know cancer's a problem,</p>
<p t="1830430" d="3660">we know heart disease is a problem, we know
poverty's a problem, etc.</p>
<p t="1834090" d="3680">There are all these problems.</p>
<p t="1837770" d="4910">How do you determine how you would allocate
resources to those different problems?</p>
<p t="1842680" d="4450">Well, it's a very very difficult problem
to get at from a scientific perspective, and</p>
<p t="1847130" d="3520">the reason for that is that well there are
all these variables that you would have to</p>
<p t="1850650" d="1000">equate.</p>
<p t="1851650" d="3730">Imagine you built a spreadsheet and so you
were thinking, “Okay, which is the most</p>
<p t="1855380" d="4740">troublesome of these things and, you know,
which could we solve with the least amount</p>
<p t="1860120" d="1000">of money.”</p>
<p t="1861120" d="5180">Well, the problem is is that to determine
whether something is troublesome you still</p>
<p t="1866300" d="1140">have to make a value judgment.</p>
<p t="1867440" d="4190">Like, there's no way you can get to the
bottom of the problem without introducing</p>
<p t="1871630" d="4280">the problem of value judgment, and that's
partly why it's very difficult to derive</p>
<p t="1875910" d="3840">an ought—what you should do—from an is—what
you know.</p>
<p t="1879750" d="3830">And that's why there's a distinction between
science and morality or science and religion,</p>
<p t="1883580" d="4320">that's another way of thinking about it:
is that they're different domains.</p>
<p t="1887900" d="7330">Now, Piaget, in some sense, has described
a way out of that because he does say, “Well</p>
<p t="1895230" d="3750">look: a theory that's better than a previous
theory is the theory that explains the same</p>
<p t="1898980" d="3990">amount and more—and you can apply that to
your personality—and a game that's better</p>
<p t="1902970" d="6080">than a different game is one that benefits
you and more people but it also does that</p>
<p t="1909050" d="2420">over different spans of time.”</p>
<p t="1911470" d="1880">Now a game like that's very hard to compute.</p>
<p t="1913350" d="4590">You know, when people talk about environmental
sustainability what they're really talking</p>
<p t="1917940" d="5590">about is a Piagetian equilibrated game where
you can live in your family and your family</p>
<p t="1923530" d="5040">can live in society and society can operate
within an economy and the economy can exist</p>
<p t="1928570" d="5780">within an ecology without having the economy
tilt the ecology so that you can't live</p>
<p t="1934350" d="5770">and your family can't live and your society
can't function and the economic system can't</p>
<p t="1940120" d="1000">function.</p>
<p t="1941120" d="5670">So there is this idea of multilevel balance
but those things are very difficult to compute,</p>
<p t="1946790" d="1000">you know.</p>
<p t="1947790" d="1560">So, but it's still a nice principle.</p>
<p t="1949350" d="4170">You know, so if you're thinking—well,
if you need a justification for what you're</p>
<p t="1953520" d="3930">doing and you want to put yourself on firm
moral ground, which is really useful because</p>
<p t="1957450" d="4290">then people can't push you around verbally
or intellectually or any other way.</p>
<p t="1961740" d="3110">Because you're grounded; you're standing
on something solid.</p>
<p t="1964850" d="3730">It's like, you need to know: why is this
good for you as if you were someone you were</p>
<p t="1968580" d="1080">taking care of?</p>
<p t="1969660" d="2800">Why is good for you across a long period of
time?</p>
<p t="1972460" d="1920">How does it benefit your family?</p>
<p t="1974380" d="1390">How does it benefit society?</p>
<p t="1975770" d="2610">And then, you know, you can keep stepping
upward from there.</p>
<p t="1978380" d="4340">So, well I can give you one example of someone
who's doing that, I think.</p>
<p t="1982720" d="4370">You know about that Dutch kid who's figured
out how to get plastic out of the oceans?</p>
<p t="1987090" d="4840">Well, he's not just whining about it and
parading around with a sign that says, you</p>
<p t="1991930" d="1570">know, “I don't like pollution.”</p>
<p t="1993500" d="3880">It's like, as if you need to tell people
that, you know, because everyone really doesn't</p>
<p t="1997380" d="2330">like—“I don't like pollution and I'm
against poverty.”</p>
<p t="1999710" d="5340">It's like, “Yeah, well find someone who's
for pollution and poverty.”</p>
<p t="2005050" d="4970">Anyways, this kid was about seventeen, something
like that, and he was diving around—he's</p>
<p t="2010020" d="1180">a diver.</p>
<p t="2011200" d="4580">I think he was spearfishing and he noticed
there was more plastic than fish.</p>
<p t="2015780" d="3070">And this wasn't a very happy discovery for
him.</p>
<p t="2018850" d="3660">And then so he started thinking about that:
How can we get the plastic out of the oceans?</p>
<p t="2022510" d="4390">And then he was looking at manta rays, and
manta rays have these big wings that help</p>
<p t="2026900" d="1590">them sort of glide through the ocean.</p>
<p t="2028490" d="2660">And he about that for a while, and then he
thought, “Well, maybe I can build this sort</p>
<p t="2031150" d="5600">of manta ray thing that lies on the surface
of the ocean in a triangle and then it could</p>
<p t="2036750" d="5500">be towed through the ocean and all the plastic
would go to the apex of the triangle.</p>
<p t="2042250" d="1890">And then you could just scoop it up.”</p>
<p t="2044140" d="4160">But then he did his calculations and I haven't
got this story quite right but this is basically</p>
<p t="2048300" d="3449">the story.</p>
<p t="2051749" d="3600">He did some calculations and found out well,
that's not cost effective because it takes</p>
<p t="2055349" d="3780">a lot of energy to drag this thing through
the water and there's a lot of water.</p>
<p t="2059129" d="3400">And, you know, plus you're polluting like
mad while you're dragging this thing through</p>
<p t="2062529" d="1000">the water.</p>
<p t="2063529" d="1520">And so probably it's just not that helpful.</p>
<p t="2065049" d="3780">But then he realized that if you go out in
the ocean there are there these massive things</p>
<p t="2068829" d="6340">called “gyres,” which are like huge water
hurricanes—except they're very very very</p>
<p t="2075169" d="1161">slow moving.</p>
<p t="2076330" d="1819">But they're huge; they're continent size.</p>
<p t="2078149" d="4151">And so the oceans are already always moving
so he thought, “Ha!</p>
<p t="2082300" d="5019">Since the ocean is moving, there's no real
reason to have to drag the, you know, the</p>
<p t="2087319" d="2171">plastic or the plastic-gatherer through the
water.</p>
<p t="2089490" d="5509">You could just nail it to the ocean bed with
cables and then just have it sit there.</p>
<p t="2094999" d="1810">And then the ocean would go through all by
itself.</p>
<p t="2096809" d="5221">So, he built a prototype, which wasn't very
big, and he gathered up a fair bit of plastic.</p>
<p t="2102030" d="3960">All the plastic's in about the top foot
of the ocean by the way, and it really increases</p>
<p t="2105990" d="3359">in density as you move up towards the top
inch.</p>
<p t="2109349" d="4801">So then he built a bigger one and he got a
bunch of—he went on Kickstarter and then</p>
<p t="2114150" d="1000">he raised a bunch of money.</p>
<p t="2115150" d="3270">And then he got a bunch of engineers to look
at his idea and they said, “Well, you know,</p>
<p t="2118420" d="1000">this would probably work.”</p>
<p t="2119420" d="4060">So then they built a big one—a couple of
kilometers long—which is now in place off</p>
<p t="2123480" d="1680">the shore of Japan.</p>
<p t="2125160" d="5409">They also sent a whole flotilla of people
from California to Hawaii to do a garbage</p>
<p t="2130569" d="3601">estimate, to see how much garbage there was
in the water, because there's a big spot</p>
<p t="2134170" d="4050">in the middle of the Pacific called the “Great
Garbage Spot,” which is full of—or the</p>
<p t="2138220" d="1260">“Great Plastic Spot?”</p>
<p t="2139480" d="2569">It doesn't matter—that's full of plastic.</p>
<p t="2142049" d="2371">And so they went to estimate how much there
was in it.</p>
<p t="2144420" d="4560">Anyways, he thinks he can guide this thing
to the bottom of the ocean in these big gyres;</p>
<p t="2148980" d="7779">make it, you know, a hundred kilometers long
in a V-shape; put a kind of a collector at</p>
<p t="2156759" d="5850">the end of it; load all the plastic he collects
up of barges; go re-refine that into oil or</p>
<p t="2162609" d="2601">plastic; and pay for it while he's doing
it.</p>
<p t="2165210" d="4329">And so you can look him up and I think he's
like nineteen or twenty now.</p>
<p t="2169539" d="3080">So, you know, that's a good equilibrated
game, right?</p>
<p t="2172619" d="1021">That works out really well.</p>
<p t="2173640" d="4570">He gets to make some money, good for him;
he gets to employ a bunch of people, that's</p>
<p t="2178210" d="3390">a good thing; everybody's happy about it
because, good, you know, we're getting rid</p>
<p t="2181600" d="3189">of the garbage; and like there's no downside.</p>
<p t="2184789" d="4861">So, you know, it's hard to say—it's
hard to come up with an argument for why that</p>
<p t="2189650" d="2439">isn't a good thing.</p>
<p t="2192089" d="3720">And it's good because everyone benefits
all the way up.</p>
<p t="2195809" d="2651">So, that's an equilibrated state.</p>
<p t="2198460" d="5129">It's a very very very smart idea.</p>
<p t="2203589" d="7460">Okay, now Jung.</p>
<p t="2211049" d="6570">Experimental psychologists don't like Jung—well,
they don't like Freud either and they don't</p>
<p t="2217619" d="3111">have much time for clinicians in general.</p>
<p t="2220730" d="6309">But that's ok: they're not trying to solve
the same problems.</p>
<p t="2227039" d="6550">Now, usually if you take a personality course,
you'll cover Freud before you cover Jung,</p>
<p t="2233589" d="6811">and the reason for that is that Freud, in
some ways, proceeded Jung historically and</p>
<p t="2240400" d="4850">lots of people, especially the Freudians,
like to think of Jung as Freud's student.</p>
<p t="2245250" d="4799">And there's some truth to that because Freud
was the first person who really collected</p>
<p t="2250049" d="6210">up ideas about the unconscious and formalized
them, publicized them, and applied them to</p>
<p t="2256259" d="3840">the problems of pathology and mental health.</p>
<p t="2260099" d="1940">So good for him.</p>
<p t="2262039" d="10330">And Freud was unparalleled at describing pathological
families, and there are plenty of those.</p>
<p t="2272369" d="2901">But Jung was interested in something that
was underneath that.</p>
<p t="2275270" d="1960">I mean Freud got underneath things a lot,
you know.</p>
<p t="2277230" d="5730">He was also one of the first people to point
out just exactly how potent sexual and aggressive</p>
<p t="2282960" d="4149">motives were in shaping the way that we thought.</p>
<p t="2287109" d="8920">But Jung: Jung was more interested—like,
in some sense, Jung was more like a Darwinian</p>
<p t="2296029" d="1161">biologist.</p>
<p t="2297190" d="9309">He was much more interested in the biological
and psychological philosophical history of</p>
<p t="2306499" d="2781">fundamental human behavioral patterns.</p>
<p t="2309280" d="2079">And so Jung wasn't like a behaviorist.</p>
<p t="2311359" d="6900">A behaviorist would think when you're born
there's nothing there except the possibility</p>
<p t="2318259" d="2070">to learn things; you're a blank slate.</p>
<p t="2320329" d="3841">And then everything you learn is a consequence
of sensory information that you're picking</p>
<p t="2324170" d="4189">up and what you learn as a consequence of
that.</p>
<p t="2328359" d="3220">But Jung, he didn't think that at all.</p>
<p t="2331579" d="7411">He thought that there's a specific human
nature, and he set out to understand what</p>
<p t="2338990" d="1440">that human nature is.</p>
<p t="2340430" d="5980">Now, a couple of lectures ago I talked to
you about the characters that you might imagine</p>
<p t="2346410" d="2240">making up the world that you inhabit.</p>
<p t="2348650" d="5630">So I said, well you can think about the absolute
unknown, which is the unknown that's so</p>
<p t="2354280" d="2740">unknown that you don't even know it's
there.</p>
<p t="2357020" d="4430">That's something that is really really shocking
if you ever encounter it, and it's the sort</p>
<p t="2361450" d="5210">of thing that you're exposed to, hypothetically,
whenever you go to a horror movie that depends</p>
<p t="2366660" d="1000">on fear.</p>
<p t="2367660" d="5089">Right, because horror movies that depend on
fear confront you with things that do not</p>
<p t="2372749" d="4271">behave the way they're supposed to behave,
like inanimate objects that move.</p>
<p t="2377020" d="4339">You know if all of a sudden you discover an
inanimate object that moves there's a lot</p>
<p t="2381359" d="2760">that's wrong with your particular model
of the world.</p>
<p t="2384119" d="3431">And you can kind of experience that in a horror
movie because things will do things that they're</p>
<p t="2387550" d="1860">not supposed to do, like walls will bleed.</p>
<p t="2389410" d="4010">That's just not supposed to happen and so
it's very upsetting to see something like</p>
<p t="2393420" d="1000">that.</p>
<p t="2394420" d="4820">But you're exposing yourself to that in
horror movies and trying to—well, you're</p>
<p t="2399240" d="4710">trying to develop some courage because God
only knows which of your fundamental major</p>
<p t="2403950" d="6960">assumptions might just turn out to be wrong.</p>
<p t="2410910" d="4439">So we talked about representations of the
absolute unknown, and I suggested that those</p>
<p t="2415349" d="5911">were often associated with serpentine predators;
and then we talked about representations of</p>
<p t="2421260" d="5799">culture, because every character has to contend
with culture, whether it's a fictional character</p>
<p t="2427059" d="1000">or you.</p>
<p t="2428059" d="1000">You're stuck with it.</p>
<p t="2429059" d="4411">You've got your culture—and some of that's
positive because here you are: you can talk,</p>
<p t="2433470" d="4039">you can read, it's warm, you know, you've
got a bright future ahead of you.</p>
<p t="2437509" d="5360">And then it's also a destructive tyrant
because it's ruining the world and all those</p>
<p t="2442869" d="1740">things that you already know about.</p>
<p t="2444609" d="3541">And then so that's culture, then there's
nature because you're stuck with that too.</p>
<p t="2448150" d="5650">And there's a benevolent element of nature
that's usually portrayed with feminine symbols—and</p>
<p t="2453800" d="3970">that's the Mother Nature that environmentalists
know and love—and then there's, you know,</p>
<p t="2457770" d="5960">Mother Nature that gives your mother cancer
when she's forty—and that's the downside</p>
<p t="2463730" d="2349">of Mother Nature and you're pretty much
stuck with that too.</p>
<p t="2466079" d="3391">And then there's you and, you know, there's
all the useful things about you—the sort</p>
<p t="2469470" d="1450">of heroic things.</p>
<p t="2470920" d="4710">Technically, you know, the parts of you that
would be able to confront the unknown and</p>
<p t="2475630" d="3780">to prevail or to confront the tyrannical part
of the culture and to prevail.</p>
<p t="2479410" d="4579">That's the positive part and then there's
the negative part, which is the part of you</p>
<p t="2483989" d="3310">that you know very very well that's always
causing trouble for you and other people.</p>
<p t="2487299" d="4500">And it doesn't do what it's supposed to
and is resentful and angry and petty and mean</p>
<p t="2491799" d="6520">and ignorant and blind and impulsive and rationalizing
and all of these lovely things that people</p>
<p t="2498319" d="1940">are more than capable of doing.</p>
<p t="2500259" d="2411">Now those are all archetypes.</p>
<p t="2502670" d="7089">And so they're archetypes because they're
the fundamental personalities that we use</p>
<p t="2509759" d="1540">to orient ourselves in life.</p>
<p t="2511299" d="2651">I guess that's the best way of thinking
about it.</p>
<p t="2513950" d="3690">Now, when Jung talked about an archetype it's
kind of complicated because sometimes he talks</p>
<p t="2517640" d="4169">about them as instincts and sometimes he talks
about them as images and sometimes he talks</p>
<p t="2521809" d="1790">about them as stories.</p>
<p t="2523599" d="3561">But the best way to contend with that is to
understand that they're all of those at</p>
<p t="2527160" d="1000">the same time.</p>
<p t="2528160" d="4790">So, for example, if you go to a romance—which
is a kind of archetypal story—you go to</p>
<p t="2532950" d="6079">a romantic comedy, say, that means, you know,
the protagonists have a love affair and it</p>
<p t="2539029" d="1921">turns out positively.</p>
<p t="2540950" d="2970">Romantic comedy: an archetypal structure.</p>
<p t="2543920" d="1710">Well, what are the characters doing?</p>
<p t="2545630" d="5159">Well, they're driven by instinct, obviously,
so that's the instinctive level of the archetype;</p>
<p t="2550789" d="4351">and then it's a behavioral pattern because
they're interacting with each other; and</p>
<p t="2555140" d="6520">it's a story because someone has selected
out the major elements of the events, in the</p>
<p t="2561660" d="3429">way that would be most engaging to an audience,
and portrayed them.</p>
<p t="2565089" d="2730">So they archetype can be all of those things
at the same time.</p>
<p t="2567819" d="3720">There's no contradiction; it just makes
it a more complex phenomena.</p>
<p t="2571539" d="3161">It's best again to think of it as a personality.</p>
<p t="2574700" d="4250">An archetype is a personality, and an archetypal
story is the manner in which an archetypal</p>
<p t="2578950" d="3609">personality manifests itself across time.</p>
<p t="2582559" d="4571">And there are lots of archetypal stories,
and I can give you a couple of fundamental</p>
<p t="2587130" d="1000">examples.</p>
<p t="2588130" d="5560">The fundamental archetype of male behavior
is the dragon story—is confronting the dragon.</p>
<p t="2593690" d="4419">And that's to go out, confront the dragon,
which can be all sorts of things—it can</p>
<p t="2598109" d="5380">be the absolute unknown; it can be the negative
element of femininity, which is a dragon that</p>
<p t="2603489" d="6540">stops men cold all the time—and usually
what happens as a consequence is that the</p>
<p t="2610029" d="3251">person gets a treasure or gets a girl.</p>
<p t="2613280" d="3549">Okay, the fundamental female archetype, as
far as I've been able to tell—it's a</p>
<p t="2616829" d="4651">little harder to track down; it took me a
long time—is Beauty and the Beast, and the</p>
<p t="2621480" d="4029">reason I figured that out—there's a bunch
of reasons but I only figured it out about</p>
<p t="2625509" d="2480">two years ago and I thought, “Yeah, of course
that's it.”</p>
<p t="2627989" d="7090">I read this book by the guys who do data analysis
at Google and it's called “A Billion Wicked</p>
<p t="2635079" d="1131">Thoughts.”</p>
<p t="2636210" d="4260">It's quite an interesting book, and basically
what it is it's a study of search engine</p>
<p t="2640470" d="1000">behavior.</p>
<p t="2641470" d="6309">And, you know, I think about 18-19% of search
engine behavior is sexual in nature, and so</p>
<p t="2647779" d="2651">then you might think, “Well, what are men
doing and what are women doing?”</p>
<p t="2650430" d="4329">Well, we know what men are doing: they're
looking at pictures of naked women, broadly</p>
<p t="2654759" d="1000">speaking.</p>
<p t="2655759" d="1010">What are women doing?</p>
<p t="2656769" d="1000">Ha!</p>
<p t="2657769" d="5611">They're not looking at pictures of naked
men; they're reading about sex.</p>
<p t="2663380" d="2399">So women's pornography use is literary.</p>
<p t="2665779" d="3030">And so I thought, “Oh that's interesting.</p>
<p t="2668809" d="3280">That makes sense,” because actually women
read more fiction than men, by the way.</p>
<p t="2672089" d="1710">Women are more predisposed to reading fiction.</p>
<p t="2673799" d="4931">Women seem to be more interested in people
than in things, a very stable cross-cultural</p>
<p t="2678730" d="1089">gender difference.</p>
<p t="2679819" d="3710">Anyways, so women are reading about sex.</p>
<p t="2683529" d="4770">And you know that if you buy, if you look
at—when I was a kid and on holidays, summer</p>
<p t="2688299" d="3341">holidays, my mom used to pack along like thirty
Harlequin romances.</p>
<p t="2691640" d="2740">Do you know what a Harlequin romance is?</p>
<p t="2694380" d="2510">Does everybody know what a Harlequin romance
is?</p>
<p t="2696890" d="1800">Does anybody not know?</p>
<p t="2698690" d="1950">Okay, most people know?</p>
<p t="2700640" d="3179">It's a cheap pulp romance, you know?</p>
<p t="2703819" d="6550">It's like deserving young woman meets dashing
and somewhat distant guy and he's already</p>
<p t="2710369" d="4210">with someone, but she doesn't deserve him,
and then she charms him.</p>
<p t="2714579" d="4420">And then, you know, he decides that she's
actually the one and then she gets to have</p>
<p t="2718999" d="2790">him and then everyone lives happily every
after.</p>
<p t="2721789" d="1601">So that's a Harlequin romance.</p>
<p t="2723390" d="4959">Now, the original Harlequin romance—they
published millions of these bloody things—was</p>
<p t="2728349" d="5180">just that, and it was a pretty plain, G-rated
story.</p>
<p t="2733529" d="5641">But since the 70's Harlequin has exploded
and it's gone from, you know, G-rated stories</p>
<p t="2739170" d="3090">of the sort I told you to like triple-X versions.</p>
<p t="2742260" d="6690">And they're all very popular and those sorts
of stories are also reflected in female use</p>
<p t="2748950" d="1000">of the Internet.</p>
<p t="2749950" d="4220">And so what you see is that they look up Beauty
and the Beast stories and there are five major</p>
<p t="2754170" d="3159">protagonists—and this is something that
I think is so absolutely comically it just</p>
<p t="2757329" d="1290">killed me when I first read it.</p>
<p t="2758619" d="8460">Here are the five major guys in female X-rated
pornography: okay, werewolf, yeah; vampire,</p>
<p t="2767079" d="4990">yeah; surgeon; yeah; billionaire, yeah; pirate.</p>
<p t="2772069" d="3500">So, isn't that funny?</p>
<p t="2775569" d="5940">Man, it just blew me over, but, you know,
it's not much different, in some sense,</p>
<p t="2781509" d="3740">than the male archetypal story of confronting
the dragon, right?</p>
<p t="2785249" d="3510">Because—and I'll show you something from
Sleeping Beauty that makes this very clear.</p>
<p t="2788759" d="2050">I'll show you that today.</p>
<p t="2790809" d="3901">Because, you know, if you think about it,
so these are kind of bad guys.</p>
<p t="2794710" d="3770">Well, the werewolf and the vampire in particular,
right, but the pirate's sort of up the too.</p>
<p t="2798480" d="4720">And you might think, “Well, why would men
like that figure in women's archetypal sexual</p>
<p t="2803200" d="3680">narratives?” and the answer to that is:
well, what the hell good is a man that can't</p>
<p t="2806880" d="2359">be dangerous, right?</p>
<p t="2809239" d="1000">Think about that.</p>
<p t="2810239" d="3421">And, you know, this bloody theme is played
out in romantic comedies all the time; think</p>
<p t="2813660" d="1000">about it.</p>
<p t="2814660" d="1290">There's the girl and she has a friend.</p>
<p t="2815950" d="1000">He's a guy.</p>
<p t="2816950" d="2240">He's kind of a guy who never grew up.</p>
<p t="2819190" d="1000">He's usually—what's his name?</p>
<p t="2820190" d="2069">There's a comedian: Seth Rogan.</p>
<p t="2822259" d="2090">He's usually Seth Rogan.</p>
<p t="2824349" d="5061">You know, and he's kind of joe everyone
and he's kind of funny and he's her friend,</p>
<p t="2829410" d="2030">but he really wants to sleep with her and
she knows that.</p>
<p t="2831440" d="3980">And she knows that he's not just her friend,
and he isn't just her friend; he just likes</p>
<p t="2835420" d="1179">to pretend that.</p>
<p t="2836599" d="4230">You know, and then there's the guy who she's
interested in who's not like Seth Rogan</p>
<p t="2840829" d="2270">and he's got an edge to him, you know.</p>
<p t="2843099" d="4470">And then the story usually plays out—there's
an interplay between those three characters.</p>
<p t="2847569" d="2811">And, you know, the Seth Rogan guy is always
going, “Well, why doesn't why doesn't</p>
<p t="2850380" d="1000">she like me?”</p>
<p t="2851380" d="3989">And the answer is: well, just watch him for
ten minutes and you know why.</p>
<p t="2855369" d="3311">You know, partly because she doesn't want
a friend.</p>
<p t="2858680" d="3360">She wants someone who's good for someone,
and someone who's good for something is</p>
<p t="2862040" d="2120">someone who's got a powerful edge.</p>
<p t="2864160" d="6730">And part of what happens in the female archetype
is that the female civilizes that, at least</p>
<p t="2870890" d="1639">in relationship to herself.</p>
<p t="2872529" d="8090">Ok, so and then, as far as I'm concerned,
that's not much different, as I said already,</p>
<p t="2880619" d="2281">than the male hero myth.</p>
<p t="2882900" d="6439">So, I'm going to show you, first, I'm
going to show you something from Sleeping</p>
<p t="2889339" d="1000">Beauty.</p>
<p t="2890339" d="12291">So let me just find it here.</p>
<p t="2902630" d="7469">What's the universal video player?</p>
<p t="2910099" d="2371">Yeah yeah, that's the one.</p>
<p t="2912470" d="1000">Thanks.</p>
<p t="2913470" d="5559">I've got to download it because, well they
strip this machine every night, and so you</p>
<p t="2919029" d="15310">have to always download things over and over.</p>
<p t="2934339" d="10401">Okay, so let's talk about the structure
of Sleeping Beauty for a minute.</p>
<p t="2944740" d="9250">So, there's a king and a queen, and, you
know, they live in a kingdom—logically enough.</p>
<p t="2953990" d="3799">And they're trying to have a baby and that
doesn't work out very well.</p>
<p t="2957789" d="3720">And then all of a sudden, you know, after
time passes they have this baby girl, and</p>
<p t="2961509" d="1810">her name is Aurora.</p>
<p t="2963319" d="4030">So that's sort of a reference to the sky,
obviously, right?</p>
<p t="2967349" d="4920">And you often see with archetypal characters
that they're affiliated, in some sense,</p>
<p t="2972269" d="1421">with cosmic phenomena.</p>
<p t="2973690" d="5590">So, for example, you know, king's and queens
have crowns, right?</p>
<p t="2979280" d="3949">And then divine figures have halos.</p>
<p t="2983229" d="7241">Well there's not much difference between
a crown and a halo, and the crown is the sun.</p>
<p t="2990470" d="2720">The little points on it: those are the rays
of the sun.</p>
<p t="2993190" d="1000">Or it's the moon.</p>
<p t="2994190" d="4179">It depends if the crown is made out of gold
or silver, because gold is a solar metal and</p>
<p t="2998369" d="2631">silver is a lunar metal.</p>
<p t="3001000" d="5420">And so, when something is associated with
the cosmos that means that it's gone from</p>
<p t="3006420" d="6260">the purely personal to the impersonal or the
transpersonal or the archetypal.</p>
<p t="3012680" d="5980">And the archetypal would be not your father,
but the Father as such—like the spirit of</p>
<p t="3018660" d="2909">the Father; not your mother, but the spirit
of the Mother as such.</p>
<p t="3021569" d="3540">And so, when you have the king and the queen
you have the Sun and the Moon.</p>
<p t="3025109" d="2720">You have the ruler of the day sky and the
ruler of the night sky.</p>
<p t="3027829" d="5700">You have the ruler over everything that the
light touches, and you have the transpersonal</p>
<p t="3033529" d="1371">figures of Mother and Father.</p>
<p t="3034900" d="7919">Okay, so now you see this in lots of movies
and hero stories and comic books.</p>
<p t="3042819" d="7440">So, the most commonly portrayed pattern is
that the hero has two sets of parents, right?</p>
<p t="3050259" d="4941">Harry Potter: he's got the Dursley's,
and they make him live under the staircase,</p>
<p t="3055200" d="2990">and then he has his brother/ cousin.</p>
<p t="3058190" d="1970">What's his name?</p>
<p t="3060160" d="1000">Dudley.</p>
<p t="3061160" d="1000">What's that?</p>
<p t="3062160" d="1000">Dudley.</p>
<p t="3063160" d="1000">Dudley!</p>
<p t="3064160" d="3540">Yeah, it's the long version of “dud.”</p>
<p t="3067700" d="6500">And, you know, he's a bad brother, and so
they're actually the archetypal hostile</p>
<p t="3074200" d="1000">brothers.</p>
<p t="3075200" d="1000">Harry Potter.</p>
<p t="3076200" d="1279">Hero and adversary.</p>
<p t="3077479" d="4571">And then he's got his ordinary parents,
and those are the parents that, well they're</p>
<p t="3082050" d="2959">real ordinary: they live in an English suburb
and they're extraordinarily conservative</p>
<p t="3085009" d="1000">and narrow-minded.</p>
<p t="3086009" d="2290">They don't want anything to do with anything
to do with anything magic whatsoever.</p>
<p t="3088299" d="3421">And then he has his Heavenly parents, who
are his magic parents.</p>
<p t="3091720" d="4180">Right, and they come back in spirit form now
and then throughout the movie when he really</p>
<p t="3095900" d="1110">needs them.</p>
<p t="3097010" d="5460">So, Superman: he's got his Earthly parents
and his Heavenly parents, right?</p>
<p t="3102470" d="6359">If you go onto Wikipedia and you look up,
“Orphan hero,” I think they have 160 of</p>
<p t="3108829" d="3811">them listed; same motif over and over.</p>
<p t="3112640" d="3800">The reason for that is, well first of all,
when you're a teenager, one thing you think</p>
<p t="3116440" d="3710">is, “Ugh, are these really my parents?”</p>
<p t="3120150" d="4580">Right, and so and the answer to that is yes
and no.</p>
<p t="3124730" d="8339">And it's yes, in that well, obviously, from
a strict immediate biological perspective</p>
<p t="3133069" d="2540">they're your parents.</p>
<p t="3135609" d="7791">But from an archetypal perspective, it's
like, well you have parents going back three</p>
<p t="3143400" d="2609">and a half billion years.</p>
<p t="3146009" d="4730">Your parents are just the latest in a very
very very long line of parents.</p>
<p t="3150739" d="3461">And so the reason you call your father “Dad,”
or “Father,” or whatever you happen to</p>
<p t="3154200" d="6200">call him, is because it's in recognition
of the fact that the relationship that you</p>
<p t="3160400" d="2949">have with him, to some degree, isn't personal;
it's archetypal.</p>
<p t="3163349" d="1000">He's the Father.</p>
<p t="3164349" d="2661">He plays that role for you.</p>
<p t="3167010" d="4499">And, you know, you can even tell when he's
playing it properly because you might tell</p>
<p t="3171509" d="3770">your friends, you know, “I don't have
a very good father.”</p>
<p t="3175279" d="2121">It's like, well how the hell do you know
that?</p>
<p t="3177400" d="2980">You know, it's sort of like you've got
this idea in your mind about what a good father</p>
<p t="3180380" d="4439">would be like, and if he's not doing that
then it's not him—you know, subject to</p>
<p t="3184819" d="1950">your childhood and teenage misinterpretations.</p>
<p t="3186769" d="2211">And, you know, “I have an awful mother.”</p>
<p t="3188980" d="1559">It's like, well, compared to what?</p>
<p t="3190539" d="1560">Well, compared to the ideal mother.</p>
<p t="3192099" d="3101">Well, you might say, “Well, just who is
this ideal mother.”</p>
<p t="3195200" d="3079">Well, you can see her in religious representations
all the time.</p>
<p t="3198279" d="3651">So in Christianity, for example, you'll
see her represented as the Virgin Mary, who's</p>
<p t="3201930" d="1049">the perfect mother.</p>
<p t="3202979" d="2350">And that's why she's a holy figure.</p>
<p t="3205329" d="4260">And she's a holy figure partly—an archetypal
figure, lets say—because any society that</p>
<p t="3209589" d="3970">doesn't worship the mother and the infant
dies.</p>
<p t="3213559" d="6581">It has to be sacred because everybody starts—everyone
has that relationship, and if the society</p>
<p t="3220140" d="3459">doesn't support it properly and value it
properly then, well, then there's something</p>
<p t="3223599" d="3970">seriously wrong with the society.</p>
<p t="3227569" d="3290">So, now Sleeping Beauty.</p>
<p t="3230859" d="1141">King and Queen.</p>
<p t="3232000" d="1000">Baby.</p>
<p t="3233000" d="5089">Okay, so we've got the familiar triad going
there.</p>
<p t="3238089" d="2420">So then they decide they're going to christen
her; they're going to name her, and that's</p>
<p t="3240509" d="1750">sort of when she becomes an individual.</p>
<p t="3242259" d="2671">And they make a mistake when they're going
to christen her.</p>
<p t="3244930" d="1000">And what's the mistake?</p>
<p t="3245930" d="1000">Do you remember?</p>
<p t="3246930" d="1570">How many of you have seen Sleeping Beauty?</p>
<p t="3248500" d="3410">Yes, and how many of you haven't.</p>
<p t="3251910" d="5889">Okay, so of those who haven't, have you
seen other Disney movies?</p>
<p t="3257799" d="1810">Have you seen other Disney movies?</p>
<p t="3259609" d="1000">Lion King.</p>
<p t="3260609" d="1000">Lion King.</p>
<p t="3261609" d="1490">Okay, anything other than that?</p>
<p t="3263099" d="1000">No.</p>
<p t="3264099" d="4051">Okay, is there anybody here who's never
seen an animated Disney movie?</p>
<p t="3268150" d="2449">Okay, fine.</p>
<p t="3270599" d="4390">Well, you see how densely—there wasn't
anyone as far as I could tell—you see how</p>
<p t="3274989" d="5320">densely distributed throughout the culture
those stories are, you know, even though they're</p>
<p t="3280309" d="4050">very very old stories, but even in their movie
form they're quite old for movies.</p>
<p t="3284359" d="3890">Okay, so the mistake they make is they don't
invite the evil queen to the christening.</p>
<p t="3288249" d="2070">And that's Maleficent.</p>
<p t="3290319" d="4680">Well, obviously there's a satanic undertone
to that, and you know that because she's</p>
<p t="3294999" d="4310">got these black horns that she wears and like
she's got this cape that's basically on</p>
<p t="3299309" d="1000">fire.</p>
<p t="3300309" d="3010">I mean you can tell that she's an evil person.</p>
<p t="3303319" d="4431">And so she's an archetype; she's the archetype
of the negative feminine actually.</p>
<p t="3307750" d="2000">And it's a very very smart story.</p>
<p t="3309750" d="4479">You think, well, why would you invite something
like that to your daughter's christening,</p>
<p t="3314229" d="3640">especially if you've been waiting for her
forever and she's a real princess and everything's</p>
<p t="3317869" d="1000">perfect.</p>
<p t="3318869" d="3400">It's like, okay here's another story.</p>
<p t="3322269" d="1871">So, this is another archetypal story.</p>
<p t="3324140" d="5119">So there's these kids and their mother gets—their
father, I think—gets divorced, or separates,</p>
<p t="3329259" d="2651">or his wife dies, or whatever.</p>
<p t="3331910" d="3339">And so he picks up with this new woman and
she decides she doesn't really like these</p>
<p t="3335249" d="1080">kids very much.</p>
<p t="3336329" d="1930">And that happens a lot by the way.</p>
<p t="3338259" d="6230">So if you have a step-parent, you are 100
times more likely to be physically abused.</p>
<p t="3344489" d="2370">So it's the biggest single risk factor.</p>
<p t="3346859" d="2660">It's up there with having a drunk parent.</p>
<p t="3349519" d="4230">So, anyways, a nasty little statistic.</p>
<p t="3353749" d="2911">You know, it's hard enough to tolerate kids
but when they're someone else's kids then</p>
<p t="3356660" d="1240">it makes it even more difficult.</p>
<p t="3357900" d="3419">And that's a Freudian observation and it's
no joke.</p>
<p t="3361319" d="3461">And people are not that friendly, and there's
terrible jealously.</p>
<p t="3364780" d="4980">Like, you know, if a man and a women start
going out and a woman has children and the</p>
<p t="3369760" d="4009">man is jealous and the children get in the
way, especially if they also bother him because</p>
<p t="3373769" d="2911">maybe they're not that happy that he's
not actually their father—maybe he's just</p>
<p t="3376680" d="4260">a creep, you know, you never know—well the
tension that can build up in a situation like</p>
<p t="3380940" d="4599">that can rapidly become unbearable and it
can last forever.</p>
<p t="3385539" d="7980">So, anyways so she tells her new husband,
“Take those damn kids out in the bush and</p>
<p t="3393519" d="4030">see if you can lose them,” and so he's
not very happy with this but I guess he's</p>
<p t="3397549" d="3631">wrapped around the finger of his new wife
and not very bright and kind of evil on his</p>
<p t="3401180" d="1000">own.</p>
<p t="3402180" d="2880">And so he takes the children out into the
forest and leaves them there.</p>
<p t="3405060" d="1529">And so this is kind of hard on the children.</p>
<p t="3406589" d="4030">It's like they're out in the wilderness,
which is maybe how you feel when your mother</p>
<p t="3410619" d="2930">dies and, you know, your father goes and marries
a new woman.</p>
<p t="3413549" d="1141">You're out in the bloody wilderness.</p>
<p t="3414690" d="3379">And they get lost and then they're lost
and they're all freaked out because they're</p>
<p t="3418069" d="1000">lost.</p>
<p t="3419069" d="2341">And they're going to starve and wolves are
going to eat them because this is like medieval</p>
<p t="3421410" d="2369">Europe forest and it's full of wolves and
they eat people.</p>
<p t="3423779" d="6080">So, and they're wandering around out there
and they come across a gingerbread house.</p>
<p t="3429859" d="5190">Now, if you're a skeptical person and you're
not naïve, the first thing you think is,</p>
<p t="3435049" d="2091">“This is too good to be true.”</p>
<p t="3437140" d="2199">It's like, yeah a house: okay fine.</p>
<p t="3439339" d="5821">A shack maybe, or even a lean-to: sure, that
could happen, but a house that's also made</p>
<p t="3445160" d="1000">out of candy.</p>
<p t="3446160" d="4589">It's like, “Nah, there's something going
on there that's not so good.”</p>
<p t="3450749" d="3120">You know the kind of person that's really
nice to you but really isn't?</p>
<p t="3453869" d="2621">You remember again the Harry Potter series?</p>
<p t="3456490" d="1129">Remember that woman?</p>
<p t="3457619" d="1000">She was a bureaucrat.</p>
<p t="3458619" d="1331">She had all those plates of kitten.</p>
<p t="3459950" d="1190">Umbridge, Dolores.</p>
<p t="3461140" d="1189">Umbridge, Dolores.</p>
<p t="3462329" d="1351">Dolores means sad, right?</p>
<p t="3463680" d="1530">Umbridge means to take offense.</p>
<p t="3465210" d="3740">So she's the sad woman who takes offense.</p>
<p t="3468950" d="3430">And she's got all these pictures of kittens
on her plates, right?</p>
<p t="3472380" d="1359">They're on ceramic plates.</p>
<p t="3473739" d="1540">And so those are like hyper-sentimental.</p>
<p t="3475279" d="1750">It's like, “Oh, aren't they cute?</p>
<p t="3477029" d="3480">And they're on plates and everything and
we'll put them on our wall,” and, you</p>
<p t="3480509" d="2300">know, it's like really low-end taste.</p>
<p t="3482809" d="4701">And the sentimentality is a facade.</p>
<p t="3487510" d="3799">Jung would call that a persona of benevolence.</p>
<p t="3491309" d="1500">But remember old Dolores Umbridge.</p>
<p t="3492809" d="1800">She's not exactly your benevolent type.</p>
<p t="3494609" d="4740">In fact, you know, let her loose on the world
and horrible things happen.</p>
<p t="3499349" d="1000">And what's her name?</p>
<p t="3500349" d="1000">The woman who wrote Harry Potter.</p>
<p t="3501349" d="1031">She got that exactly right.</p>
<p t="3502380" d="1639">It's one of her best characters, I think.</p>
<p t="3504019" d="5350">So, she's got that, you know, fake voice
that often hear people who actually don't</p>
<p t="3509369" d="3160">like children use when they're talking to
children.</p>
<p t="3512529" d="1270">“Oh!</p>
<p t="3513799" d="1560">Aren't you just the cutest little thing?”</p>
<p t="3515359" d="3631">It's like, you know, you can actually talk
to children and they actually like that.</p>
<p t="3518990" d="5171">And then they don't think that, you know,
you're possessed by something that they</p>
<p t="3524161" d="2749">should run anyway from as fast as possible.</p>
<p t="3526910" d="3360">Anyways, so Hansel and Gretel.</p>
<p t="3530270" d="1949">The woman comes out and she's all nice.</p>
<p t="3532219" d="1880">And she says, “Oh, children, you're lost
in the forest.</p>
<p t="3534099" d="1990">Why don't you come in and have some gingerbread.”</p>
<p t="3536089" d="5881">And so then she puts little Hansel in a cage—like
a bird-cage I think—and she gets Gretel</p>
<p t="3541970" d="1829">to do all the slavery stuff, you know.</p>
<p t="3543799" d="1250">So she's not so nice.</p>
<p t="3545049" d="4891">And then every day she's stuffing them well
with gingerbread and then she goes and feels</p>
<p t="3549940" d="4250">little Hansel's legs so that he's nice
and plump so she can throw him into the stove</p>
<p t="3554190" d="1000">and eat him.</p>
<p t="3555190" d="3690">And what that means is: beware of people who
are too nice to you because what they're</p>
<p t="3558880" d="2090">trying to do is devour you.</p>
<p t="3560970" d="4889">And it's the prime dictum of Freudian psychopathology.</p>
<p t="3565859" d="4221">If you have a parent—now Freud concentrated
mostly on mothers because mothers are more</p>
<p t="3570080" d="1060">likely to do this.</p>
<p t="3571140" d="3639">Because for a variety of reasons that we're
not going to talk about—probably because</p>
<p t="3574779" d="4340">they are oriented towards babies but whatever.</p>
<p t="3579119" d="4841">If you're too nice to your child and you
do everything for them, what happens to them?</p>
<p t="3583960" d="4190">Well, then they can't do anything for themselves.</p>
<p t="3588150" d="1129">And so then what happens?</p>
<p t="3589279" d="3171">Well, then they live in your basement until
they're fifty.</p>
<p t="3592450" d="4480">You know, and then they get irritated one
day and they shoot up Dawson College.</p>
<p t="3596930" d="5250">So there's a deep metaphor in the story,
and the story is if it's too damn good to</p>
<p t="3602180" d="3149">be true it's probably aiming at your destruction.</p>
<p t="3605329" d="2240">Okay, now back to Sleeping Beauty.</p>
<p t="3607569" d="4730">So, Sleeping Beauty, Aurora, is going to be
christened, and they decide not to invite</p>
<p t="3612299" d="1770">the evil queen to the christening.</p>
<p t="3614069" d="2430">Now, that's not a very good idea.</p>
<p t="3616499" d="9381">One time I had—this is a composite client—so
this person, all she wanted to do was sleep.</p>
<p t="3625880" d="2220">So she'd sleep like sixteen – seventeen
hours a day.</p>
<p t="3628100" d="3050">And she was doing that partially with sleeping
pills, because it's hard to sleep that much,</p>
<p t="3631150" d="3290">but left to her own devices she would just
sleep.</p>
<p t="3634440" d="4859">Now, you might say, “Well, why would someone
want to do that?” and then you could say,</p>
<p t="3639299" d="4470">“Well, for the same reason that people drink
themselves into unconsciousness and oblivion.”</p>
<p t="3643769" d="3381">Which is like it's painful to be conscious,
especially when your life isn't going that</p>
<p t="3647150" d="3919">well and maybe you're afraid of things,
and so why be awake and suffer when you can</p>
<p t="3651069" d="2371">be unconscious and not suffer?</p>
<p t="3653440" d="2020">And so that was basically her idea.</p>
<p t="3655460" d="7680">And she was a vegetarian and she was terrified
of butcher shops and she was terrified of</p>
<p t="3663140" d="1079">raw meat.</p>
<p t="3664219" d="3341">And that was logical because she was sort
of terrified of life, and if you're going</p>
<p t="3667560" d="3459">to be terrified of life, if you really think
about it it's the whole bloody raw meat</p>
<p t="3671019" d="2520">part of life that you're more or less terrified
by.</p>
<p t="3673539" d="2940">So that was very concretized in her situation.</p>
<p t="3676479" d="3921">And so I used to take her to supermarkets
through the raw meat section because that's</p>
<p t="3680400" d="1000">what you do in psychotherapy.</p>
<p t="3681400" d="4590">In case any of you want psychotherapy, you
have to do the thing you least want to do,</p>
<p t="3685990" d="1650">and so that's not particularly fun.</p>
<p t="3687640" d="4520">That's the gateway to enlightenment: you
walk through the gate that you least want</p>
<p t="3692160" d="1000">to.</p>
<p t="3693160" d="3689">Well, so now you why people aren't enlightened;
because it's not all fun and games and follow</p>
<p t="3696849" d="1391">your bliss and all that nonsense.</p>
<p t="3698240" d="5240">It's like figure out what you're afraid
of and avoiding and confront it voluntarily.</p>
<p t="3703480" d="6769">So anyways, I got a little background from
her and her mother, who I met—who was definitely</p>
<p t="3710249" d="4531">the evil queen—I mean she yelled at me for
like forty-five minutes in my office.</p>
<p t="3714780" d="1339">It was really quite remarkable.</p>
<p t="3716119" d="4500">I hadn't had anyone—I've only had one
other person yell at me in my office ever,</p>
<p t="3720619" d="2610">and she was also definitely an evil queen.</p>
<p t="3723229" d="2471">But this woman, she was just something else.</p>
<p t="3725700" d="2909">Like it was just jaw-dropping to watch her
perform.</p>
<p t="3728609" d="4041">And she used to phone up my client all the
time, three or four times a day, and tell</p>
<p t="3732650" d="1780">her how stupid and useless she was.</p>
<p t="3734430" d="5169">And so if you have parents that phone you
up every day and tell you how stupid and useless</p>
<p t="3739599" d="4490">you are, then it's perfectly within your
rights to not talk to them because that isn't</p>
<p t="3744089" d="1200">what they should be telling you.</p>
<p t="3745289" d="4091">So then you can say, “Well, how about if
I call you, instead of you calling me, and</p>
<p t="3749380" d="3409">how about if it's once every two weeks,
instead of three times a day, and how about</p>
<p t="3752789" d="3770">if you say anything nasty I just hang up and
then I just don't talk to you for a month.”</p>
<p t="3756559" d="3150">And then you might say, “Well, I couldn't
do that to my mother,” and I would say,</p>
<p t="3759709" d="2590">“Well, that's because she already won.”</p>
<p t="3762299" d="7280">So anyways, this girl, her mother loved her
to death when she was little; she was perfect.</p>
<p t="3769579" d="2990">She was a princess when she was little but
then of course she hit puberty.</p>
<p t="3772569" d="2990">You know, and then that's the end of the
whole princess thing because then of course</p>
<p t="3775559" d="4480">you want to go out and have a life and maybe
associate with boys and do all that sort of</p>
<p t="3780039" d="3401">things that's not the least bit child-princess
like.</p>
<p t="3783440" d="7039">And that's when everything broke down and
started to go in a very very bad direction.</p>
<p t="3790479" d="4310">And that was partly because her mom didn't
want to invite the Evil Queen to her little</p>
<p t="3794789" d="3601">daughter's life, because the Evil Queen
is like the negative part of nature.</p>
<p t="3798390" d="3909">And like, if you have a little girl, well
the probability that she's going to grow</p>
<p t="3802299" d="3730">up and be a teenager and then a woman is pretty
high unless you do something to seriously</p>
<p t="3806029" d="2280">interfere with that, which you might.</p>
<p t="3808309" d="4981">And so you bloody well better be prepared
for that when she's three and not treat</p>
<p t="3813290" d="3400">her like she's someone who's feet are
never going to touch the earth.</p>
<p t="3816690" d="3909">You have to have the whole element of life
in there.</p>
<p t="3820599" d="1401">I had another client.</p>
<p t="3822000" d="7009">Her parents taught her that adults were angels—and
I don't mean metaphorically; they actually</p>
<p t="3829009" d="1070">taught her that.</p>
<p t="3830079" d="5000">And, in doing so, they set her up for serious
post-traumatic stress disorder, which she</p>
<p t="3835079" d="4841">had for about five years, because she ran
into someone, who wasn't an angel—surprise</p>
<p t="3839920" d="4980">surprise—and all he did to her, roughly
speaking, was look at her like he wanted to</p>
<p t="3844900" d="1000">kill her.</p>
<p t="3845900" d="2560">And you think, “Well, nobody can be traumatized
like that.”</p>
<p t="3848460" d="4180">It's like, “Well, A, probably no one's
ever looked at you like that, so don't be</p>
<p t="3852640" d="5290">so sure; but B, if they did look at you like
that AND you thought that adults were angels,</p>
<p t="3857930" d="4369">then you were pretty much nicely set up to
have post-traumatic stress disorder.</p>
<p t="3862299" d="4241">So, anyways you might think that you're
doing your children a big favor by keeping</p>
<p t="3866540" d="3840">the Evil Queen out of their nursery, but,
you know, you might let them see a glimpse</p>
<p t="3870380" d="3959">of her now and then so they can get used to
the fact that she exists.</p>
<p t="3874339" d="3520">You know, and I guess that's why children
have pets in part.</p>
<p t="3877859" d="1000">Like mice: they don't last very long.</p>
<p t="3878859" d="4521">So you have a live mouse for a while and then
you have a dead mouse, and that's not very</p>
<p t="3883380" d="1000">good.</p>
<p t="3884380" d="3429">But then there's some things that you get
accustomed to while you're doing that, and</p>
<p t="3887809" d="3101">maybe it's not so good to protect your children
from that because they're going to have</p>
<p t="3890910" d="2780">to grow up and survive in the awful world.</p>
<p t="3893690" d="2000">And your job isn't to make them happy.</p>
<p t="3895690" d="4470">Your job is to make them able to survive in
the nasty real world.</p>
<p t="3900160" d="3909">Anyways, okay so that's what happens with
Sleeping Beauty at the beginning; it's like</p>
<p t="3904069" d="1180">Hansel and Gretel.</p>
<p t="3905249" d="4580">And then the Evil Queen shows up anyways,
because good luck keeping her out of your</p>
<p t="3909829" d="4071">house, and she basically says, “Yeah, well
that's all well and good.</p>
<p t="3913900" d="2980">You know, there's nothing I can do about
it but come puberty, roughly speaking…”</p>
<p t="3916880" d="5489">In the Sleeping Beauty [story] she's going
to prick her finger on a needle on a spinning</p>
<p t="3922369" d="1000">wheel.</p>
<p t="3923369" d="3871">So there's blood involved there so we don't
have to use our imagination too much to imagine</p>
<p t="3927240" d="1000">what that means.</p>
<p t="3928240" d="3299">It's like, “I'm going to come back and
then all hell's going to break loose.”</p>
<p t="3931539" d="5951">And, of course, then the parents really protect
her, which is exactly the wrong thing to do,</p>
<p t="3937490" d="2819">and well, that's the Sleeping Beauty story.</p>
<p t="3940309" d="4621">Of course the Prince comes along and he eventually
figures out how to solve this problem, right?</p>
<p t="3944930" d="5089">She needs him, he's a pretty good guy, then
the Evil Queen puts him in a dungeon—it's</p>
<p t="3950019" d="4770">like her basement—and then she's going
to keep him there until he's so old that</p>
<p t="3954789" d="3730">he can't even ride and she's going to
laugh at him as he tries to leave.</p>
<p t="3958519" d="3550">And then he tries to leave and she turns into
a dragon.</p>
<p t="3962069" d="1000">It's like, “What the hell?</p>
<p t="3963069" d="1381">Why is she turning into a dragon?”</p>
<p t="3964450" d="1230">But you accept that.</p>
<p t="3965680" d="1000">It's no problem.</p>
<p t="3966680" d="2179">“Of course the Evil Queen turns into a dragon.</p>
<p t="3968859" d="1150">What else would she do?”</p>
<p t="3970009" d="3310">And then she, you know, spouts fire at him
and he fights her off.</p>
<p t="3973319" d="4540">And then he has to hack his way through all
the thorns and thistles that have gathered</p>
<p t="3977859" d="1331">around the castle.</p>
<p t="3979190" d="3899">And then he wakes the girl up and the fountains
come back on and everyone's happy.</p>
<p t="3983089" d="2520">And you all think that's an excellent story.</p>
<p t="3985609" d="3730">So, and it is an excellent story, but it's
a weird story because it's an archetypal</p>
<p t="3989339" d="3720">story and you understand it at an archetypal
level.</p>
<p t="3993059" d="7730">I mean let me show you some of it and then
I'll talk a little bit more about it.</p>
<p t="4000789" d="31210">So let's look at the beginning to begin
with.</p>
<p t="4031999" d="18770">Oh yeah.</p>
<p t="4050769" d="9391">Sorry.</p>
<p t="4060160" d="8660">This is a class so I don't want you to actually
enjoy the movie.</p>
<p t="4068820" d="1000">So I'm going to play around it a bit.</p>
<p t="4069820" d="1190">Okay, so tell me about the book.</p>
<p t="4071010" d="3660">Is it a valuable book or not?</p>
<p t="4074670" d="1319">How do you know?</p>
<p t="4075989" d="1000">Gold.</p>
<p t="4076989" d="1000">Hey!</p>
<p t="4077989" d="2901">It's covered with gold and jewels so you
can get a hint right there that there's</p>
<p t="4080890" d="1000">something valuable about this.</p>
<p t="4081890" d="1199">Let's see if I can do this properly.</p>
<p t="4083089" d="7150">Yeah, that'll do I guess.</p>
<p t="4090239" d="5881">Yeah, it's a valuable book; it's got gold
and jewels.</p>
<p t="4096120" d="2850">Why are—why is gold valuable?</p>
<p t="4098970" d="1419">It's rare.</p>
<p t="4100389" d="4881">Yeah, it's like the sun; looks like the
sun.</p>
<p t="4105270" d="1000">What else?</p>
<p t="4106270" d="1549">It's morally pure, gold.</p>
<p t="4107819" d="1000">Why?</p>
<p t="4108819" d="1000">It represents wealth?</p>
<p t="4109819" d="1000">It does.</p>
<p t="4110819" d="1000">Well, it is wealthy.</p>
<p t="4111819" d="3770">But it's morally pure because it won't
mix with other metals.</p>
<p t="4115589" d="2500">It doesn't mate with other metals.</p>
<p t="4118089" d="5541">It's imperishable and it doesn't tarnish,
so it's a symbol of purity.</p>
<p t="4123630" d="3629">And jewels: why are they beautiful and valuable?</p>
<p t="4127259" d="1011">Forget about rare.</p>
<p t="4128270" d="1000">They're shiny?</p>
<p t="4129270" d="1440">Yeah, they're shiny!</p>
<p t="4130710" d="1750">But even crows can appreciate that.</p>
<p t="4132460" d="2290">So, like what does shiny have to do with it
do you think?</p>
<p t="4134750" d="1000">Sun.</p>
<p t="4135750" d="1000">Sun.</p>
<p t="4136750" d="1400">Yeah, it reflects light, right?</p>
<p t="4138150" d="1810">So what do you want a good person to do?</p>
<p t="4139960" d="1270">Well, maybe you might say that…</p>
<p t="4141230" d="1000">Shine like the sun.</p>
<p t="4142230" d="1000">Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p t="4143230" d="1000">They reflect light.</p>
<p t="4144230" d="3929">And the reason—it's interesting, eh, because
the reason that crystals are the way they</p>
<p t="4148159" d="3491">are, translucent and reflect light, is because
their internal structure.</p>
<p t="4151650" d="6459">A crystal is a lattice of molecules and then
that lattice is precisely replicated everywhere</p>
<p t="4158109" d="4021">in the crystal, so it's one thing all the
way down to the molecular level.</p>
<p t="4162130" d="2899">And so one of the things that you might think
is that if—especially if you think about</p>
<p t="4165029" d="4770">that hierarchical model that we were talking
about—is that if you were as well put together</p>
<p t="4169799" d="4270">as you could be, and had maybe been subject
to the right amount of heat and pressure,</p>
<p t="4174069" d="3811">that you would be the same thing at every
single level of being.</p>
<p t="4177880" d="3729">And then you would be solid and crystalline
and you would reflect light.</p>
<p t="4181609" d="4951">And so anyways, you get a hint right off the
bat that this story is valuable.</p>
<p t="4186560" d="1000">In a far away land, long ago, lived a King
and his fair Queen.</p>
<p t="4187560" d="1000">Many years had they longed for a child, and
finally their wish was granted.</p>
<p t="4188560" d="1000">A daughter was born and they called her Aurora.</p>
<p t="4189560" d="1000">Sweet Aurora.</p>
<p t="4190560" d="1000">Yes, they named her after the dawn for she
filled their lives with sunshine.</p>
<p t="4191560" d="1000">Then a great holiday was proclaimed throughout
the kingdom so that all of high or low estate</p>
<p t="4192560" d="1000">may pay homage to the infant princess, and
our story begins on that most joyful day.</p>
<p t="4193560" d="1000">On that joyful day.</p>
<p t="4194560" d="1840">On that joyful day.</p>
<p t="4196400" d="9980">Joyfully now to our princess we come bringing
gifts and all good wishes to re-pledge our</p>
<p t="4206380" d="1250">loyalty anew.</p>
<p t="4207630" d="6190">Hail to the Princess Aurora.</p>
<p t="4213820" d="14399">All of the sultans and orphans.</p>
<p t="4228219" d="7321">Hail to the King!</p>
<p t="4235540" d="9860">Hail to the Queen!</p>
<p t="4245400" d="23080">Hail to the Princess Aurora!</p>
<p t="4268480" d="27480">Health to the Princess!</p>
<p t="4295960" d="7460">Wealth to the Princess!</p>
<p t="4303420" d="1270">Long live the Princess Aurora!</p>
<p t="4304690" d="1000">Hail Aurora!</p>
<p t="4305690" d="2049">A son and heir to Stefan's child would be
betrothed.</p>
<p t="4307739" d="6681">And so, to her, his gift he brought and looked
unknowing on his future brother.</p>
<p t="4314420" d="21330">Thou most honored and exalted Excellencies:
the three Good Fairies!</p>
<p t="4335750" d="4260">Mistress Flora…</p>
<p t="4340010" d="6000">So these are the good elements of the feminine
here and they give her various gifts.</p>
<p t="4346010" d="1000">Sweet Princess, my gift shall be…</p>
<p t="4347010" d="1000">Why, it's Maleficent!]</p>
<p t="4348010" d="1000">What does she want here?]</p>
<p t="4349010" d="10290">Well, quite a glittering assemblage, King
Stefan.</p>
<p t="4359300" d="30500">Royalty, nobility, the gentry, and, oh, wow
quaint, even the rabble.</p>
<p t="4389800" d="14950">I really felt quite distressed at not receiving
an invitation.</p>
<p t="4404750" d="4489">You weren't wanted.</p>
<p t="4409239" d="2991">Not wanted?</p>
<p t="4412230" d="2730">Alright, well we're out of time.</p>
<p t="4414960" d="5250">I'll show you a bunch more of this next
class and we'll see what it means.</p>
