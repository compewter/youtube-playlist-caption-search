<p t="11520" d="3700">OK, so</p>
<p t="15220" d="7900">the last time we were here we got maybe a third of the way through this story</p>
<p t="23120" d="7180">the story of Pinokio and the transformation of a marionette into something hypothetically real</p>
<p t="30300" d="5480">I'm gonna backtrack a few slides and it'll get us into it again</p>
<p t="35780" d="7920">so you remember that the blue fairy, so I would say that the benevolent element of mother nature</p>
<p t="43700" d="3840">in the schemata that we are going to use to investigate mythology</p>
<p t="47540" d="6960">was more or less allowed her entrance because Gepetto was a good guy and he wished for the right thing</p>
<p t="54500" d="4560">and so in some sense... here's a way of thinking about that... you know</p>
<p t="59060" d="6880">genetic / environmental studies on children's temperament have revealed something quite interesting</p>
<p t="65940" d="6280">which is that the shared environment that children have within a family</p>
<p t="72220" d="4220">so that would be what's the same about your environment and your brother's environment, the same</p>
<p t="76440" d="3820">doesn't have that much effect on your temperament or his temperament</p>
<p t="80260" d="4840">'cause the presumption always was that within a family there is a shared environment, right?</p>
<p t="85100" d="4900">and something was common about the environment to every child within that environment</p>
<p t="90000" d="4100">but there isn't much of a shared environmental effect on temperament</p>
<p t="94100" d="6380">so then you can say, well that makes it appear as though isn't that relevant in relationship to the development of temperament</p>
<p t="100480" d="2960">but you could also suggest something else</p>
<p t="103440" d="8200">you could suggest that if parenting is occurring properly, the effect of the shared environment should be very close to zero</p>
<p t="111640" d="6440">and the reason for that is that you establish an individual relationship with each child</p>
<p t="118080" d="8440">and the environment is actually a microenvironment that's composed of your observations of this child and that specific child's interaction with you</p>
<p t="126520" d="6160">like to some degree, if there is a shared environment, that means that you're forcing the same principles on every child</p>
<p t="132680" d="5140">so my suspicions are, although I don't know this, and the research hasn't been done</p>
<p t="137820" d="6160">that in bad families there's a shared environmental effect, but in good families that minimizes</p>
<p t="143980" d="8320">so that lets the child's biological predisposition, roughly, manifest itself with support and in some positive manner</p>
<p t="152300" d="5760">well, I don't want to extend the analogy too far, but you can imagine</p>
<p t="158060" d="6040">that, and this is what this film proposes, if you aim properly in relationship to your child</p>
<p t="164100" d="5080">what you're trying to do is to establish an individual relationship and to allow them to move towards</p>
<p t="169180" d="4900">whatever their particular expression of individuality happens to be</p>
<p t="174080" d="4820">and that's... that would be the same as allowing nature to take its course in some sense</p>
<p t="178900" d="3500">at least nature in its positive guise, and that's exactly what happens here</p>
<p t="182400" d="7380">the other thing that happens, of course, is that the cricket, for reasons that aren't clear, precisely</p>
<p t="189780" d="5960">is knighted by the blue fairy and serves as Pinokio's conscience</p>
<p t="195740" d="6860">although he isn't very good at it, which is a very peculiar thing, and quite a marked point that the film is making</p>
<p t="202600" d="3340">that that conscience actually has something to learn, too</p>
<p t="205940" d="4180">and there's actually a Freudian element to that, you know, because Freud thought of the superego</p>
<p t="210120" d="4000">as the internalization, roughly speaking, of the father,</p>
<p t="214120" d="6060">and it could be very severe, the superego, so like a really strict father, really tyrannical father inside your head</p>
<p t="220180" d="7540">although I think it's better to think about the superego as the internalized representation of society at large</p>
<p t="227720" d="5820">mediated to some degree through your parents, 'cause it's not as if your father, even assuming he's tyrannical</p>
<p t="233540" d="5040">is the inventor of all those tyrannical rules, he's the  propagator of them</p>
<p t="238580" d="6980">but he's actually a proxy voice, even if it's just for the harsh side of society, he's the proxy voice for society</p>
<p t="245560" d="6960">and because we're social creatures, the utility of having an internal social voice to guide you</p>
<p t="252520" d="5480">although, again, you seem to be able to follow it or not follow it, which I also find spectacularly interesting</p>
<p t="258000" d="4760">because, obviously if it was an unerring guide, you could just follow it</p>
<p t="262760" d="7480">and if it was an unerring guide, you wouldn't need free will either, because you could just act out the dictates of this internal representation</p>
<p t="270240" d="2000">that isn't what you do</p>
<p t="272240" d="6220">so anyways, the proposition here is that the conscience exists, but it's a relatively flawed entity</p>
<p t="278460" d="4160">it needs to be modified as well by nature</p>
<p t="282620" d="7260">which is quite interesting, 'cause the blue fairy knights him, 'cause you also might think of the conscience as only something that's socially constructed</p>
<p t="289880" d="3800">right, which is the more typical viewpoint, but I don't buy that for a second</p>
<p t="293680" d="7620">because I believe firmly, and I believe the Piagetian interpretation of child development</p>
<p t="301300" d="6500">more or less bears this out, is that there are parameters within which conscience has to operate</p>
<p t="307800" d="6400">and it's sort of like this, it's like, it's the same parameters that govern fair play, we'll say that</p>
<p t="314200" d="6260">and so you can say there's fair play within a game, and there's fair play across sets of games</p>
<p t="320460" d="5760">and the set of games is pretty much indistinguishable from the actual environment</p>
<p t="326220" d="8360">if you think all the things you do as nested games, at some point the spread of that is large enough so that it encompasses everything you do</p>
<p t="334580" d="7880">which includes the environment, and so I believe that you're adapted to the set of all possible games, roughly speaking</p>
<p t="342460" d="2980">all possible playable games, something like that</p>
<p t="345440" d="5940">and that you know the rules for that, which is why, we talked about this a little bit, why you're so good at identifying cheaters</p>
<p t="351380" d="3380">we have a module for that, according to the evolutionary psychologists</p>
<p t="354760" d="5020">and not only you identify them, but you remember them, it really sticks in your mind</p>
<p t="359780" d="6460">and there's other evidence, too, one piece of evidence that I love, well, there's a couple</p>
<p t="366240" d="8740">one I would derive from Frans de Waal, who's a famous primatologis, and he studied the prototype morality that emerges in chimpanzees</p>
<p t="374980" d="3860">and it's very much nested in their dominance structures</p>
<p t="378840" d="6840">you know, because you could think of morality in some sense as the understanding of the rules by which the dominance hierarchy operates, right</p>
<p t="385680" d="4120">and so you could say, well, the biggest, ugliest, meanest chimp...</p>
<p t="389800" d="5140">and the male dominance hierarchies in chimps seem to be the predominant ones, although the females also have a dominance hierarchy</p>
<p t="394940" d="4620">it's not quite so clear in bonobos, which seem to be more female-dominated</p>
<p t="399560" d="5380">but in any case, the primary chimp dominance structure is male</p>
<p t="404940" d="7500">and you could think, well it's like the caveman chimp who's biggest and toughest who necessarily rules, and who rules longest</p>
<p t="412440" d="6080">but that isn't what de Waal  found; see, the problem with being... mean, lets say</p>
<p t="418520" d="6060">and not negotiating your social landscape, and not trading reciprocal favors</p>
<p t="424580" d="8140">is that no matter how powerful you are as an individual, two individuals three quarters your power could do you in</p>
<p t="432720" d="6220">and that happens with the chimps fairly regularly; if the guy on top is too tyrannical</p>
<p t="438940" d="5100">and doesn't make social connections, then weaker chimps, males, make good social connections</p>
<p t="444040" d="3900">and when he's not in such good shape, they take him down, and viciously too</p>
<p t="447940" d="5840">de Waal has documented some unbelievably horrendous acts of, let's call it, regicide</p>
<p t="453780" d="4080">among the chimpanzee troupes that he studied, mostly in the Arnhem zoo</p>
<p t="457860" d="3600">the big troupe there, that's been there a long time</p>
<p t="461460" d="5540">but he's very interested in prototypical morality, and here's some other examples of prototypical morality</p>
<p t="467000" d="3260">emerging among animals, there's many of them, but one is</p>
<p t="470260" d="4860">you know, if two wolves have a dominance dispute, again that would be more likely among the male wolves</p>
<p t="475120" d="5500">but it doesn't really matter, they basically display their size, and they growl ferociously</p>
<p t="480620" d="5980">and they puff up their hair so they look bigger, and you can see cats do that when they go into fight or flight</p>
<p t="486600" d="4200">not only do they puff up, including their tail, but they stand sideways</p>
<p t="490800" d="2520">and the reason they do that is because they look bigger</p>
<p t="493320" d="3380">right, 'cause they're trying to put up the most intimidating possible front</p>
<p t="496700" d="5600">so anyways, if two wolves are going at it, what they're really trying to do is to size each other up</p>
<p t="502300" d="3760">and they're trying to scare each other into backing off, fundamentally</p>
<p t="506060" d="5220">because, see, the worst-case scenario is like, you're wolf number one, and I'm wolf number two</p>
<p t="511280" d="6120">and we tear each other to shreds, but I win, but I'm so damaged after that wolf number three comes in and takes me out</p>
<p t="517400" d="6500">so, like, there's a big cost to be paid even for victory in a dominance dispute, if it degenerates into violence</p>
<p t="523900" d="6480">and animals, and human beings, but animals in particular, have evolved very, very specific mechanisms</p>
<p t="530380" d="5880">to escalate dominance disputes towards violence step by step</p>
<p t="536260" d="6360">so that they don't... so that the victor doesn't risk incapacitating himself by winning</p>
<p t="542620" d="6560">so what happens with the wolves is that, you know, they growl at each other and posture display, and maybe they even snap at each other</p>
<p t="549180" d="4100">but the probability that they're gonna get into a full-fledged fight is pretty low</p>
<p t="553280" d="4220">and what happens is, one of the wolves backs off,  and flips over and shows his neck</p>
<p t="557500" d="4780">and that basically means: ";all right, tear it out,"; and the other wolf says:</p>
<p t="562280" d="6220">though of course he doesn't, ";well, you're kind of an idiot, and you're not that strong, but we might need you to take down a moose in the future</p>
<p t="568500" d="3760">and, you know, despite your patheticness, I won't  tear out your throat";</p>
<p t="572260" d="5980">and then they've established their dominance position, and then, from then on, at least for some substantial period of time</p>
<p t="578240" d="3140">the subordinate wolf gives way to the dominant wolf</p>
<p t="581380" d="4760">but at least the subordinate wolf is alive, and, you know, he might be dominant over other wolves</p>
<p t="586140" d="6740">and so, everyone in the whole hierarchy has sorted that out either through mock combat or through combat itself</p>
<p t="592880" d="8280">and, you know, the low-ranking members aren't in the best possible position, but at least they're not getting their heads torn off every second of their existence</p>
<p t="601160" d="5400">so there's even some utility in the stability of the dominance hierarchy for the low-ranking members</p>
<p t="606560" d="4740">'cause at least they're not getting pounded, getting threatened, which is way better</p>
<p t="611300" d="3300">I mean it's not good, but it's way better than actual combat</p>
<p t="614600" d="4300">and then there's the example of rats, which I love, this is Jaak Panksepp's work</p>
<p t="618900" d="4460">and he wrote a book called affective neuroscience, which I highly, highly recommend</p>
<p t="623360" d="3500">I have a list of readings, recommended readings on my website</p>
<p t="626860" d="6820">it's a brilliant book, and he's a brilliant psychologist, really, one of the top psychologists as far as I'm concerned</p>
<p t="633680" d="6500">both theoretically and experimentally, a real genius, he's the guy who discovered that rats laugh when you tickle them</p>
<p t="640180" d="5220">they laugh ultrasonically, so you can't actually hear them, but if you record it and slow it down</p>
<p t="645400" d="4840">then you can hear them giggling away when you tickle them with an erase, which  is sort of like their mother's tongue</p>
<p t="650240" d="4860">it's often what lab people use as a substitute for the licking of the little rat by the mother</p>
<p t="655100" d="5780">so, and he discovered the paly circuit in mammals, which is like a major deal, right</p>
<p t="660880" d="4900">he should get a Nobel prize for that, that's a big deal to discover an entire motivational circuit</p>
<p t="665780" d="5480">whose existence no one had really predicted, you know, apart from the fact that obviously mammals play</p>
<p t="671260" d="4560">and even lizards maybe, some of them are social lizards, seem to play</p>
<p t="675820" d="5980">so, anyhow, what Panksepp observed, and I think this is a brilliant piece of science</p>
<p t="681800" d="6400">is that, first of all, juvenile male rats in particular like to rough and tubmle play</p>
<p t="688200" d="5220">like to wrestle, and they actually pin each other like little kids do, or like adult wrestlers do</p>
<p t="693420" d="5020">they pin their shoulders down, and that basically means you win, and so, OK, so that's pretty cool</p>
<p t="698440" d="3740">but what's even cooler, I think, well there's three things, one is:</p>
<p t="702180" d="5160">the rats will work for an opportunity to get into an arena where they know that play might occur</p>
<p t="707340" d="4620">and so that's one of the scientific ways of testing an animal's motivation, right</p>
<p t="711960" d="5620">so imagine you have a starving rat and it knows that it's got food down in the end of a corridoor</p>
<p t="717580" d="6160">you can put a little spring on its tail and measure how hard it pulls, and that gives you and idication of its motivational force</p>
<p t="723740" d="7260">now, imagine the starving rat that's trying to get to some food, and you have a little spring on its tail, and you waft in some cat odor</p>
<p t="731000" d="6280">so now that rat is starving and wants to get out of there, he's going to pull even farther towards the food</p>
<p t="737280" d="6320">so getting away plus getting forward are separate motivational systems, and if you can add them together it's real potent</p>
<p t="743600" d="5860">and part of the reason why in the future authoring exercise that you guys are gonna do as the class progresses</p>
<p t="749460" d="3880">you're asked to outline the place you'd like to end up, which is your desired future</p>
<p t="753340" d="4620">and also the place that you could end up if you let everything fall apart</p>
<p t="757960" d="5500">so that your anxiety chases you and your approach systems pull you forward</p>
<p t="763460" d="7560">you're maximally motivated then, and it's important, because otherwise you can be afraid of pursuing the things you wanna pursue</p>
<p t="771020" d="5500">right, and that's very common, and so then the fear inhibits you as the promise pulls you forward</p>
<p t="776520" d="4900">but it makes you weak, because you're afraid; you wanna get your fear behind you, pushing you</p>
<p t="781420" d="5900">and so what you wanna be is more afraid of not pursuing your goals than you are of pursuing them</p>
<p t="787320" d="5440">it's very, very helpful; and lots of times in life, and this is something really worth knowing</p>
<p t="792760" d="4180">you know, and this is one of the advantages to being an autonomous adult</p>
<p t="796940" d="3560">you don't get to pick the best thing, you get to pick your poison</p>
<p t="800500" d="4260">you have two bad choices, and you get to pick which one you're willing to suffer through</p>
<p t="804760" d="5340">and every choice has a bit of that element in it, and so, if you know that it's really freeing</p>
<p t="810100" d="6600">because otherwise you torture yourself by thinking: ";well, maybe there's a good solution to this, compared to the bad solution";</p>
<p t="816700" d="5120">it's like, no, no, sometime's there's just risky solution 1, and risky solution 2</p>
<p t="821820" d="6180">and sometimes both of them are really bad, but you at least get to pick which one you're willing to suffer through</p>
<p t="828000" d="5380">and that's... that actually makes quite a bit of difference, because you're also facing it voluntarily then</p>
<p t="833380" d="5820">instead of it chasing you, and that is an entirely different psychophysiological response</p>
<p t="839200" d="6040">challenge vs threat, it's not the same, even if the magnitude of the problem is the same</p>
<p t="845240" d="5020">and so putting yourself in a challenging, let's call it, mindframe, you can't just do that by magic</p>
<p t="850260" d="5440">putting yourself in a challenging mindframe is much easier on you psychophysiologically</p>
<p t="855700" d="4660">'cause you don't produce... you don't go into the generalized stress response to the same degree</p>
<p t="860360" d="6360">and you're activating your exploratory and seeking systems, which are dopaminergically mediated, and that involve positive emotion</p>
<p t="866720" d="7340">so if you can face something voluntarily, rather than having it chase you, it's way better for you psychophysiologically</p>
<p t="874060" d="7980">so, that's partly why, well, it's worthwhile to go find the dragon in its lair instead of waiting for it to come and eat you</p>
<p t="882040" d="4980">so, and especially if you also add the idea that if you go find the dragon in its lair</p>
<p t="887020" d="6020">you might find it when it's a baby, instead of a full-fledged bloody monster that is definitely gonna take you down</p>
<p t="893040" d="7480">and so that's part of the reason why... well there's a whole bunch of things that emerge out of that observation</p>
<p t="900520" d="4200">like: don't avoid small problems that you know are there</p>
<p t="904720" d="4380">face them, because they'll grow into big problems all by themselves</p>
<p t="909100" d="6160">and you can think about... imagine the tax department sends you a notification, you owe them, like, 300 dollars</p>
<p t="915260" d="4680">well it's, you know, that's annoying, maybe you don't even wanna open the letter</p>
<p t="919940" d="5540">or maybe if you do, you just put it on the shelf, but that damn thing doesn't just sit there like a piece of paper on the shelf</p>
<p t="925480" d="5620">right, you ignore that for 5 or 6 years, it's gonna become attached to all sorts of horrible things</p>
<p t="931100" d="8200">and if you ignore it long enough... you get the idea, it's gonna turn into something that's completely unlike the little piece of paper that it's written on</p>
<p t="939300" d="7800">and many, many problems in life are like that, you'll see that they pop their ugly little head up, and you know</p>
<p t="947100" d="4380">and you might wanna turn away, you might not want to think about it</p>
<p t="951480" d="3680">which is the easiest way of turning away, right, you just don't attend to it</p>
<p t="955160" d="4000">it's not like you repress it or anything like that, you just fail to attend to it</p>
<p t="959160" d="4660">and that's a... really, as a long-term strategy it's dismal</p>
<p t="963820" d="5320">it's also something, I think, that's more characteristic of people who are high in neuroticism and high in agreeableness</p>
<p t="969140" d="2120">'cause agreeable people don't like conflict</p>
<p t="971260" d="6960">and people who are high in neuroticism, or high in negative emotion, are hit harder per unit of uncertainty or threat</p>
<p t="978220" d="6540">and so, you know, and that's partly why in psychotherapy a lot of times the people you see need assertiveness training</p>
<p t="984760" d="5960">so that would be the opposite of agreeableness, or they need help to get their anxiety and emotional pain under control</p>
<p t="990720" d="5140">those are not the only reasons, there's antisocial behavior, but you can't fix that in therapy in all likelyhood</p>
<p t="995860" d="3960">there's alcoholism, there's lotsa, lotsa other reasons, but those are two major reasons</p>
<p t="999820" d="6520">so anyways, there is a... that was all to telly you that... oh yes, back to the rats</p>
<p t="1006340" d="6180">so okay, the rats are pulling on... you can measure rat motivation by how hard they pull on the spring, let's say</p>
<p t="1012520" d="5200">and they're more motivated if they're running away and they're running towards, but let's go back to play</p>
<p t="1017720" d="4580">so, you can take juvenile rats who haven't been able to play for a while, maybe they've been isolated</p>
<p t="1022300" d="7220">or maybe they just haven't been able to engage in physical activity, like many schoolchildren that you might be thinking about</p>
<p t="1029520" d="5720">neither allowed to play nor engage in physical activity, and there's a reason I'm telling you that</p>
<p t="1035240" d="5580">so anyways, you get one of these little rats, and you can measure how hard he'll pull to go out and play</p>
<p t="1040820" d="4060">or how many buttons he'll push, you know, and that gives you an indication of his motivation</p>
<p t="1044880" d="7780">so anyways, you can see that the play-deprived juvenile rat will fight harder to play than a non-play deprived juvenile rat</p>
<p t="1052660" d="4480">and so you can infer that the rat wants to go play</p>
<p t="1057140" d="4760">and, you know, you do that... you do the same measurement with everyone around you</p>
<p t="1061900" d="5900">if they wanna do something, you're gonna poke and prod at them to see what sort of things they're willing to overcome</p>
<p t="1067800" d="3680">in order to go and do that, you'll object even if you don't really object</p>
<p t="1071480" d="5100">it's like... it's a measurement device, and if they're willing to overcome a bunch of your objections</p>
<p t="1076580" d="2340">then you think: ";oh, well, maybe they really want to";</p>
<p t="1078920" d="7740">and that's another thing to really know: if there's something you want, you need about five arguments about why you want it</p>
<p t="1086660" d="7020">because the probability that the person who's opposing you will have five arguments about why you should't have it is very low</p>
<p t="1093680" d="4580">they just won't have thought it through enough; so the other thing that happens in the future authoring exercise</p>
<p t="1098260" d="6360">is that you're asked to articulate the reasons for all the goals that come out of your vision of the future</p>
<p t="1104620" d="5880">so you're asked like: ";why would it be good for you? why would it be good for your family? why would it be good for broader society?";</p>
<p t="1110500" d="3160">so that gives you three levels of argumentation right there</p>
<p t="1113660" d="4620">and if you have it articulated down into detail, and it's related to other important goals</p>
<p t="1118280" d="5220">they you're a hell of a thing to argue with, because people just aren't that deep</p>
<p t="1123500" d="5360">by which I mean that they just don't have that many levels of explanation or objection</p>
<p t="1128860" d="4980">and it's also really useful in relationship to your own mind, because if you want to do something that's difficult</p>
<p t="1133840" d="5240">and that requires energy, a lot of different subsystems  in your mind are gonna throw up objections</p>
<p t="1139080" d="3980">it's like, ";well, maybe that isn't what you should be doing right now, maybe you should be doing the dishes</p>
<p t="1143060" d="2900">or vacuuming, or watching TV, or looking at YouTube";</p>
<p t="1145960" d="5040">if you're really sneaky, when you're trying to do something hard, what your brain does</p>
<p t="1151000" d="5580">is give you something else hard to do that 's not quite as hard, so that you can feel justified in not doing the thing you're supposed to</p>
<p t="1156580" d="4800">'cause you're doing somethig else useful, and if you give in to that temptation, which you often will</p>
<p t="1161380" d="4900">then it wins, and because it wins, it gets a little dopamine kick, and it grows stronger</p>
<p t="1166280" d="4640">anything you let win the internal argument, grows</p>
<p t="1170920" d="3040">and anything you let be defeated, shrinks</p>
<p t="1173960" d="3220">'cause it's punished, it doesn't get to have its way</p>
<p t="1177180" d="5520">so that's another thing really to remember, don't practice what you do not wanna become</p>
<p t="1182700" d="6340">and because those are... they're neurological circuits, you build those thing in there man, and they're not going anywhere</p>
<p t="1189040" d="3980">you can build another little machine to inhibit them, that's the best you can do</p>
<p t="1193020" d="6680">once they're in there, you can't get them out, so... and then the one's you built to inhibit can be taken out by stress</p>
<p t="1199700" d="5060">and the old habits will come back up, so you gotta be careful what you say and what you do</p>
<p t="1204760" d="4640">because you build yourself that way; so anyways, back to the rats</p>
<p t="1209400" d="4820">okay, so the little rat gets to go out there and play, now imagine one little rat is paired with another rat</p>
<p t="1214220" d="7380">but the other little rat is 10% bigger, 10% in juvenile rats is enough to attain permanent dominance</p>
<p t="1221600" d="6780">so the 10% bigger rat will win the first wrestling, and so that's what happens</p>
<p t="1228380" d="4820">and then... so the little rat gets pinned, and maybe they play a bit, and then they're done with it</p>
<p t="1233200" d="4060">and so you separate them, then you let them play again, and the next time what happens</p>
<p t="1237260" d="3680">is that the subordinate rat does the invitation to play</p>
<p t="1240940" d="3140">and that's like, you know, like a dog does when he wants to play</p>
<p t="1244080" d="4620">you can recognize that, it kind of splays its feet apart, and looks up and looks interested</p>
<p t="1248700" d="4340">and then it sort of dances around; you can do it with any kid that has a clue, you know</p>
<p t="1253040" d="5280">that hasn't been destroyed by adults, if your little 3-year-old, or 4-year-olds are better for this</p>
<p t="1258320" d="4580">if you go like this, like, they know exactly what's gonna happen, you know, they're ready to dart back and forth</p>
<p t="1262900" d="7460">and they'll usually smile, and kids love rough and tumble play, which is now basically illegal in all daycare</p>
<p t="1270360" d="6140">seriously, it's seriously is, kids need it so desperately, 'cause it teaches them the limits of their body</p>
<p t="1276500" d="3960">and your body, and it teaches them what's painful and what isn't</p>
<p t="1280460" d="5700">and it teaches them the dance of play, and without that they're just little disembodied blobs</p>
<p t="1286160" d="4300">like, they have no finesse, that's what you're checking out when you dance with someone, you know</p>
<p t="1290460" d="6200">you're seeing if they have that fluency and facility for mutual reciprocal action</p>
<p t="1296660" d="6900">embodied in them; and if they're kinda like this, you know, and don't have any sense of rhythm and don't pay any attention to you</p>
<p t="1303560" d="4960">and all of that, you have reason to question whether they actually inhabit their body</p>
<p t="1308520" d="7480">and whether they can engage in a mutual interaction, physical interaction that's going to be reciprocal and mutually satisfying</p>
<p t="1316000" d="6940">it's really important to check out; and a lot of that rough and tubmle play, even interactions between a child and its mother</p>
<p t="1322940" d="7520">if you have a happy mother and a happy infant, and you videotape them, and you speed up the video tape, you'll see that they're dancing</p>
<p t="1330460" d="6240">so one responds, then the other responds, then the other responds, it might be just with eye gaze, and movement, and all of that</p>
<p t="1336700" d="4980">but there's a dynamic interplay, which you don't see with depressed mothers and their infants</p>
<p t="1341680" d="7100">so, okay, so back to play, so the little rat, who is the subordinate one, he has to do the invitation</p>
<p t="1348780" d="4740">and then the big rat can agree to play, 'cause he's in the dominant position</p>
<p t="1353520" d="4720">but if you pair them repeatedly, and this is really worth thinking about</p>
<p t="1358240" d="4200">because, you see, morality emerges out of repeated interactions</p>
<p t="1362440" d="5840">because, you might say, if you only interact with someone once, you might as well just take advantage of them and run off</p>
<p t="1368280" d="7120">that's what a psychopath does, by the way, and there is room in the environmental niche for psychopaths</p>
<p t="1375400" d="3540">but they have to keep moving around, 'cause otherwise people figure out who they are</p>
<p t="1378940" d="5660">so they just move around, and they can take advantage of one person, you know, maybe five times, or ten times, or something</p>
<p t="1384600" d="3560">and then the reputation spreads, and they gotta get the hell out of there</p>
<p t="1388160" d="4460">but... so it's not a good long-term strategy, unless you can't think of a better one</p>
<p t="1392620" d="7840">so anyways, if you repeatedly pair these rats, unless the big rat lets the little rat win at least 30% of the time</p>
<p t="1400460" d="3000">the little rat will not ask the big rat to play</p>
<p t="1403460" d="5060">and that is... it's a staggering discovery, it's a staggering discovery</p>
<p t="1408520" d="4700">because you've got the emergence there of an implicit morality, essentially</p>
<p t="1413220" d="4160">that's even incarnated in rats, that emerges across multiple play sessions</p>
<p t="1417380" d="4940">it's like, yes, exaclty, that's exactly what Piaget said about the emergence of morality</p>
<p t="1422320" d="4700">it's exactly the same idea, at the rat level, so it's a massively...</p>
<p t="1427020" d="4020">and the fact that there's a circuit, a separate neurophysiological circuit</p>
<p t="1431040" d="4080">that's actually specialized for that sort of thing is also a big deal</p>
<p t="1435120" d="7500">now the other thing  Panksepp figured out is that if you deprive juvenile rats of the opportunity to engage in rough and tumble play</p>
<p t="1442620" d="2620">their prefrontal cortexes don't develop properly</p>
<p t="1445240" d="6100">and they become impulsive and restless, and then you can fix them with methylphenidate or ritalin</p>
<p t="1451340" d="6540">and those are the drugs that are used to fix hyperactive kids, most of who are male</p>
<p t="1457880" d="5060">and that's because, well, really, you're gonna take your six-year-old, your five-year-old</p>
<p t="1462940" d="5880">you're gonna put them in a desk, you're gonna get them to sit there for six hours, that's your plan, right?</p>
<p t="1468820" d="5640">that's a stupid plan; and they're denied the opportunity to engage in play</p>
<p t="1474460" d="5180">and that means that their ability to become social is being impaired</p>
<p t="1479640" d="3740">it may cause neurological impairment, that's what the rat evidence suggests</p>
<p t="1483380" d="6100">and then you suppress that with amphetamines, 'cause amphetamines actually activate the play circuit</p>
<p t="1489480" d="3840">they activate a different circuit, which will suppress the play circuit</p>
<p t="1493320" d="5400">so it's very, very... it's not very wise, and I'm not gonna go off on that tangent</p>
<p t="1498720" d="5280">because I could tell you why the school systems were set up that way, which I probably will at some point</p>
<p t="1504000" d="6400">because it's quite and interesting story in and of itself, and it's the reason all you guys are sitting in desks right now</p>
<p t="1510400" d="7460">somebody laughingly referred to this once as grade 15, that was pretty funny, given the look of the bloody place, you know</p>
<p t="1517860" d="4160">hideous... okay</p>
<p t="1522020" d="5880">so, now, this is an interesting thig, so you got the emergence of morality in, say chimps</p>
<p t="1527900" d="3700">you got the emergence of morality in wolves, you got the emergence of morality in rats</p>
<p t="1531600" d="6160">and the morality governs sequential interactions or group interactions, they have to repeat</p>
<p t="1537760" d="5420">because, because it's an emerging property of social or repetitive interactions</p>
<p t="1543180" d="4080">that's why, you can't just localize it in one instance, it's repeated</p>
<p t="1547260" d="2740">and there's been computer simulations of this</p>
<p t="1550000" d="4660">they help you figure out how you might attain victory across games, across time</p>
<p t="1554660" d="6820">maybe you need a strategy, and there's a very simple strategy, which, I believe is called ";modified tit for tat";</p>
<p t="1561480" d="4520">so if you're nice to me, I'm nice back, and if you do something bad to me, I do something bad back</p>
<p t="1566000" d="7180">but imagine you run that out in sequences of behavior, and see who does with what strategy across time</p>
<p t="1573180" d="6480">or an alternative strategy... [?] here's the best strategy: I trust you, you trust me, we start interacting</p>
<p t="1579660" d="3960">you screw up, I whack you, and then I forgive you, and we start again</p>
<p t="1583620" d="2860">that's modified tit for tat, and so...</p>
<p t="1586480" d="9580">it's a very simple algorithm; no one has come up with a better algorithm in a computerized simulation of game space than that particular strategy</p>
<p t="1596060" d="5900">so it's like: trust but don't be a pushover, if someone violates the rules, you gotta nail them</p>
<p t="1601960" d="4040">but then you don't hold a grudge, you open the door to further interactions</p>
<p t="1606000" d="2880">so, pretty smart, pretty smart</p>
<p t="1608880" d="6960">and, okay, so anyways... so what this means, 'cause rats can't talk, and wolves can't talk, and chimpanzees can't talk</p>
<p t="1615840" d="6120">and what that means, just as Piaget suggested, was that the morality, the development of the morality</p>
<p t="1621960" d="4760">precedes the development of the linguistic ability to describe the rules for the morality</p>
<p t="1626720" d="7200">he said exactly the same thing about kids, right, is that they learn to play games before they know what the rules are to the games</p>
<p t="1633920" d="4840">and so, you see that when you're playing peek-a-boo with a kid, they can pick that up really young</p>
<p t="1638760" d="6560">they get that right away, and there's... you can play with kids almost immediately after they're born, if you play simple enough games</p>
<p t="1645320" d="3180">so they've got that deep, and they're unbelievably playful</p>
<p t="1648500" d="6860">so, they've got that circuitry ready to go right off the bat, and it's one of the things that makes kids so much fun</p>
<p t="1655360" d="7080">because they just like to play all the time, and so if you... if the play circuit in you hasn't died</p>
<p t="1662440" d="5680">which is a bad thing, then you can use that a lot with your kids, and it's one of the things that helps you love them</p>
<p t="1668120" d="3280">so that's a good thing, so, okay</p>
<p t="1671400" d="6880">so, the point is that the damn morality emerges before the representation of the morality</p>
<p t="1678280" d="5320">it's a big deal to know that, and that it emerges as a consequence of repeated social interaction</p>
<p t="1683600" d="3960">so it's not a top-down thing, it's a bottom-up thing</p>
<p t="1687560" d="6300">now, Piaget says: well, it's not just bottom-up, because what happens with human beings is that they learn to play the games...</p>
<p t="1693860" d="6760">one of his experiments was: watch seven-year-olds, I think that's the right age, play marbles</p>
<p t="1700620" d="4580">and then he noticed that they can play with each other, and that they can follow the rules</p>
<p t="1705200" d="4400">but that if you take the individual seven-year-old out of the game, and you say: what are the rules?</p>
<p t="1709600" d="3760">they give incoherent and incomplete explanations of the rules</p>
<p t="1713360" d="4760">so what that means is they don't really represent the rules, but they can act them out</p>
<p t="1718120" d="3760">and have a partial representation of what they're acting out</p>
<p t="1721880" d="5740">now, when they get older, the rule representation starts to fall into alignment with the actual rules of the game</p>
<p t="1727620" d="6180">and you can imagine that's why [?], because when they're playing something like marbles, they're gonna have discussions like: you're cheating</p>
<p t="1733800" d="4280">or: you're not allowed to do that, 'cause they're always gonna be pushing the envelope a little bit</p>
<p t="1738080" d="3840">and then the group is gonna render a judgment on whether or not that's appropriate</p>
<p t="1741920" d="5620">and out of that the rules are going emerge, but they're not rules to begin with, they're patterns of behavior</p>
<p t="1747540" d="4660">it's not the same thing as a rule, a rule describes a pattern of behavior</p>
<p t="1752200" d="4180">but a pattern of behavior is a pattern of behavior, it's something that's acted out</p>
<p t="1756380" d="8100">so, there's the individual within the group and then the interactions of the individuals within the group produce a hierarchical arrangement</p>
<p t="1764480" d="5040">or multiple hierarchical arrangements, those are games, roughly speaking, or stories</p>
<p t="1769520" d="4040">nested iside an overarching story, which is the fundamental culture</p>
<p t="1773560" d="4980">right, and that's nested within a whole bunch of competing cultures that have some commonalities</p>
<p t="1778540" d="5820">or they would just be at war all the time, which, you know, to some degree they are</p>
<p t="1784360" d="6940">so, okay, now, you see that... back to the movie, you see that happening in the movie</p>
<p t="1791300" d="6360">I mean it's very, very quick, but the blue fairy turns the bug into the conscience</p>
<p t="1797660" d="4940">and then the bug tries to explain to Pinokio what the rules of morality are</p>
<p t="1802600" d="5140">but the thing is the bug doesn't know, because he's just a bug, and you know, he's just not omniscient, so</p>
<p t="1807740" d="7920">the best he can do is to come up with, like, a propagandistic semantic, verbal representation</p>
<p t="1815660" d="5300">that's internally contradictory, and when he tells Pinokio, Pinokio has no idea what he's talking about</p>
<p t="1820960" d="3640">and neither does the bug, that's the thing; and so...</p>
<p t="1824600" d="5360">so what happens is this, the cricket says: well Pinok, maybe you and I had better have a little heart-to-heart talk</p>
<p t="1829960" d="6480">and the puppet says: why? 
and the cricket says: well, you wanna be a real boy, don't you?</p>
<p t="1836440" d="5320">alright, sit down son, now you see the world as full of temptations</p>
<p t="1841760" d="5520">- temptations?
- yes, temptations, they're the wrong things that seem right at the time</p>
<p t="1847280" d="8260">but even though the right things may seem wrong sometimes, sometimes the wrong things may be right at the wrong time</p>
<p t="1855540" d="5280">or vice versa, understand?
- no!</p>
<p t="1860820" d="6060">no, and neither did the cricket, and that's actually very nicely done in that piece of the movie</p>
<p t="1866880" d="4180">because you just wanna slap him as soon as he starts talking like that</p>
<p t="1871060" d="6240">because he gets up on his little matchbox and lectures, and he's dull and tyrannical, both at the same time</p>
<p t="1877300" d="5680">and so there's nothing genuine about what he's saying, he's imitating something that isn't him</p>
<p t="1882980" d="4280">so he's really acting like a puppet at that point, too, and it doesn't work at all</p>
<p t="1887260" d="6560">and so Pinokio says: I'm going to try to be a good boy; and the cricket says: well that's the spirit, son</p>
<p t="1893820" d="2860">and then away they go, so...</p>
<p t="1896680" d="4500">alright, so then we're at the next day, 'cause this all happens in one night</p>
<p t="1901180" d="3580">we're at the next day, and you know, it's a nice day, and there's these birds flying around</p>
<p t="1904760" d="3380">that's actually, that's a bit of foreshadowing there, you know</p>
<p t="1908140" d="5840">so, um, you have to remember, when you watch something like this movie</p>
<p t="1913980" d="4020">not a single bit of it is random or accidental, none of it</p>
<p t="1918000" d="6520">because, you know, they had to draw I don't remember how many frames per second these things are</p>
<p t="1924520" d="6120">thirty, maybe, if it's high-quality animation; so someone had to paint thirty pictures to get a second of this</p>
<p t="1930640" d="5840">you're not doing that accidentally, it's really expensive, and everyone has to agree on exactly what's going to happen</p>
<p t="1936480" d="4520">and you might say: well, do the people who are doing this consciously know what they're doing?</p>
<p t="1941000" d="6120">and the answer to that is: well, sort of, just like you do, it's yes, they know, and no, they don't</p>
<p t="1947120" d="5900">and they know because they're really smart and gifted, and all that, but they don't know, because it's not all articulated</p>
<p t="1953020" d="5780">plus they're working in a group, so they know and don't know, just like you do when you're watching it</p>
<p t="1958800" d="2840">and so... and when you do anything else...</p>
<p t="1961640" d="5200">now, they're also guided by what you might call... they're guided by their unconscious</p>
<p t="1966840" d="3460">in the Freudian, and in the cognitive way, partly because</p>
<p t="1970300" d="5140">your unconscious value structures determine the direction and content of your perceptions</p>
<p t="1975440" d="5220">so it's built right into the way you move your eyes, 'cause you tend to look at things you value</p>
<p t="1980660" d="4400">right, or at things you're afraid of, like you look at things with valence</p>
<p t="1985060" d="5940">and part of the decision about what has value is dependent on the implicit structure of your moral system</p>
<p t="1991000" d="2940">because morality is about what's good, and what isn't</p>
<p t="1993940" d="4680">and that's been partly a conscious construction of you, but it's partly partly something you've been...</p>
<p t="1998620" d="3360">you've picked up by interacting with people like mad since you were born</p>
<p t="2001980" d="3140">you don't know all the rules anymore than the damn cricked did</p>
<p t="2005120" d="6380">you just don't, and you can't, 'cause you're too complicated, but you act them out</p>
<p t="2011500" d="5160">and then you also have representations of how people act, in your imagination</p>
<p t="2016660" d="6960">that's what a dream is, that's what a fantasy is, that's what that little movie that plays inside your head when you remember what you did is</p>
<p t="2023620" d="9060">and you only remember the gist, you know, so even the imagistic representation of your behavior in your past, which is basically your episodic memory</p>
<p t="2032680" d="5400">it's already selecting, and molding, and turning it into a relatable story</p>
<p t="2038080" d="3720">it can't help but do that, it's the only way you can represent it</p>
<p t="2041800" d="5360">and so you don't know how you do that or why you do that, but part of it's governed by this implicit morality</p>
<p t="2047160" d="7320">it's part of your procedural memory, part of the way you act, part of the way you move your eyes, and listen to things, and focus on them</p>
<p t="2054480" d="6380">that's all been instantiated inside of you because of your biology, but also this immense social project</p>
<p t="2060860" d="2160">that you're continually engaged in</p>
<p t="2063020" d="6780">and so, that informs what you remember, it informs what you imagine, it informs what we collectively imagine</p>
<p t="2069800" d="2840">it informs what we can collectively understand</p>
<p t="2072640" d="9340">and partly what you're doing while you become conscious of yourself is to map the implicit structures that already constitute you</p>
<p t="2081980" d="3700">from society into explicit representation</p>
<p t="2085680" d="5500">that's what self-understanding means; and you know, when you have that moment of insight about something you've done</p>
<p t="2091180" d="5380">it's like you're watching this repetitive behavior that you've manifested, probably that got you in trouble</p>
<p t="2096560" d="4020">you know, it's your characteristic way of falling accidentally into chaos</p>
<p t="2100580" d="4660">and you talk about it, your problems, you talk about them with your friends, you talk about them</p>
<p t="2105240" d="2820">and maybe you have dreams about them, and you're trying to relate them</p>
<p t="2108060" d="3220">and you have memories about them that you can't get rid of, 'cause they're negatively toned</p>
<p t="2111280" d="5180">so you talk about them, and then someone comes up with a little statement that links them together causally</p>
<p t="2116460" d="4820">and you thing: aha! that's what I'm doing; and then maybe you can stop doing it</p>
<p t="2121280" d="5620">or at least maybe then you can thing of some strategies for not doing it anymore</p>
<p t="2126900" d="5160">but it's not like you know, it's like you're acting it out, you know it that way</p>
<p t="2132060" d="7320">but until the representation matches that pattern, that click of insight doesn't occur</p>
<p t="2139380" d="3620">and that's like a revelation, it's a really good way of thinking about it</p>
<p t="2143000" d="5940">because the knowledge is there in its implicit form, and all of a sudden, bang! it's been made explicit</p>
<p t="2148940" d="4780">as a fantasy maybe, or also as a set of semantic statements</p>
<p t="2153720" d="3600">you know, maybe you have a crush on someone and you don't notice it</p>
<p t="2157320" d="6500">and maybe you find yourself having a fantasy about them, you think: oh! that means something!</p>
<p t="2163820" d="4960">maybe you don't want to know that that's what you want, but the fantasy will tell you</p>
<p t="2168780" d="6880">and one of the things Jung suggested, and this is sort of out of the freudian tradition of free association</p>
<p t="2175660" d="6640">is: watch yourself, watch your fantasies, because they're always happening, and they'll tell you something</p>
<p t="2182300" d="7260">and so, one of the things I do when I'm interacting with my clients is we'll have a discussion, and then their eyes will drift a little bit</p>
<p t="2189560" d="4040">and I'll know that something's flitted through their mind, you know</p>
<p t="2193600" d="4880">and that means we've touched on something that has a multiplicity of elements</p>
<p t="2198480" d="5120">and so I'll stop and say: look, I noticed that you... maybe you teared up, that's another thing  to really watch</p>
<p t="2203600" d="6200">or maybe you laughed, or you drifted at least, it's like... it's because some other thought has entered your field of consciousness</p>
<p t="2209800" d="4040">and if you can get the person to grab those thoughts, to notice them</p>
<p t="2213840" d="6020">then you can often figure out the avenues along which that particular conversation might unfold</p>
<p t="2219860" d="3560">that's a complex, that's a Jungian complex or a psychoanalytic complex</p>
<p t="2223420" d="5080">it's like, there's an emotional core that produces a whole range of associated ideas</p>
<p t="2228500" d="5720">and that thing's got a life, it's like a micropersonality, and it might have resentment in it, might have anger</p>
<p t="2234220" d="7900">it's often negative emotion-tinged, because negative emotion-tinged episodes are still problems</p>
<p t="2242120" d="6500">and they will emerge automatically, 'cause you're threat detection systems force them onto your consciousness, essentially</p>
<p t="2248620" d="7640">so you watch, and when you drift... you'll drift, and the fantasy is partly a representation of of the problem space</p>
<p t="2256260" d="3520">you know, that happens when you wake up at three in the morning and you're worried about things</p>
<p t="2259780" d="4140">right, 'cause actually what happens is you wake up during threat processing</p>
<p t="2263920" d="5640">and if you're depressed, actually that gets so intense, you can't sleep, so then you just lay there all night, worrying</p>
<p t="2269560" d="5560">not fun, and those are fantasies about the negative elements of your past, present and future</p>
<p t="2275120" d="7640">and the fantasies can also breed solutions, and that's partly why Freud regarded dreams as wish-fulfillments</p>
<p t="2282760" d="6320">it's partly... and he wasn't... that was where he stopped; it's not correct</p>
<p t="2289080" d="6860">it's partially correct, it's like the fantasy will provide you with a problem and a potential solution</p>
<p t="2295940" d="8700">but they're more like problem-identification mechanisms, the fantasies, with the possibility of a solution built in</p>
<p t="2304640" d="6880">and so, a way of thinking about that is that you can generate potential futures</p>
<p t="2311520" d="4740">so they're like each segregateable environments, according to the rules of your fantasy</p>
<p t="2316260" d="5720">then you can generate little avatars of yourself that inhabit each of those little universes, and you can run them as simulations</p>
<p t="2321980" d="5920">and then you can watch what happens in the simulation, and if it's a catastrophy, then you don't have to act it out</p>
<p t="2327900" d="5300">and that's exactly, not exactly, that's akin to what you're doing when you go watch a movie</p>
<p t="2333200" d="7720">except that is much more coherent and well thought-through, than just a dream, which is often quite fragmentary</p>
<p t="2340920" d="7400">that's partly 'cause the dream is willing to sacrifice coherence to play with category structures</p>
<p t="2348320" d="3760">you know, and that's why in dreams things can change one thing into another really weirdly</p>
<p t="2352080" d="5520">or scenes can change from one scene into another without a logic, the logic gets loosened</p>
<p t="2357600" d="3220">so that the expanse of your thinking can widen</p>
<p t="2360820" d="5240">and it's dangerous to do that, and that's partly why you do it while you're asleep and paralyzed</p>
<p t="2366060" d="8560">you know, you don't run around and act out your pseudopodal fantasies, where you're stretching yourself out into the world</p>
<p t="2374620" d="4800">there's no risk, exactly, although it can be bad enough so you'll wake up in terror</p>
<p t="2379420" d="3960">but that's better than being in a crocodile's mouth by a large margin</p>
<p t="2383380" d="7460">anyways, back to these birds, these are used later in the movie as manifestations of the Holy Spirit, roughly speaking</p>
<p t="2390840" d="3540">and of course that's a standard Christian symbol, although, as I mentioned</p>
<p t="2394380" d="5040">the dove often represents the Holy Spirit, and we'll talk about that  later</p>
<p t="2399420" d="6080">but this movie has very strong pagan elements in it, as I mentioned before</p>
<p t="2405500" d="3460">as opposed to strictly Christian symbolism</p>
<p t="2408960" d="4960">but that's foreshadowing, and what it foreshadows is that, well, a new day has dawned</p>
<p t="2413920" d="5360">it's  the emergence of new consciousness, and everything last night went well, really well</p>
<p t="2419280" d="6380">everything in the... let's call it the unconscious, say, after time stops, that all went well, and so the new day is full of promise</p>
<p t="2425660" d="4560">and so, the birds are singing, and the sun is shining, and, like, hurray</p>
<p t="2430220" d="7980">this is the next scene, right, so it sets the tenor for that scene just like the introductory song does</p>
<p t="2438200" d="6360">so anyways, then you see all these kids playing and enthusiastic, so they're off to school</p>
<p t="2444560" d="4200">which is presented in a positive light, and so that's where you get socialized</p>
<p t="2448760" d="5120">so Pinokio's ready to go beyond the boundaries of the familial home</p>
<p t="2453880" d="4580">and he's ready because his father prepared him, and his mother prepared him</p>
<p t="2458460" d="3520">and so he goes off, and he's not going off alone, he's going with his conscience</p>
<p t="2461980" d="5620">you can think about it, again, as the internalized representation of nature and society</p>
<p t="2467600" d="3980">and so he's not going out there alone, even though he's not very good at it</p>
<p t="2471580" d="5980">he's pretty excited about it, and so is Gepetto; see, Gepetto isn't standing there paralyzed with terror</p>
<p t="2477560" d="6500">and the kid isn't phobic of the outside world, and so he's treating it as an adventure</p>
<p t="2484060" d="5880">even though, well, it's an adventure, but adventures can be dangerous</p>
<p t="2489940" d="9380">you can imagine a kid, especially one who's, like, high in neuroticism, who hasn't been encouraged sufficiently to overcome that, let's say</p>
<p t="2499320" d="4940">their primary idea might be: well, what if the other kids don't like me</p>
<p t="2504260" d="3380">that's a big one; what if the teachers don't like me, what if the other kids won't play with me</p>
<p t="2507640" d="7500">it's like, yeah, what if, that's rough, man, and if you're not a playful kid, it could easily be the case</p>
<p t="2515140" d="4360">so... but that's not Pinokio, he's like, spinning out, ready to go</p>
<p t="2519500" d="7040">and so... good, good, he's got... naive, but enthusiastic, ok, well at least that gets the ball rolling</p>
<p t="2526540" d="5200">now, you've got these two evil creatures here, the fox and the cat</p>
<p t="2531740" d="6140">I think this one's based on one of the Marx brothers, actually, Harpo Marx, who, I believe, never said anything</p>
<p t="2537880" d="5380">but, be that as it may, they're these ne'er-do-well characters, the fox in particular</p>
<p t="2543260" d="10720">now fox is standard trickster animal, right, it's a... classic animal, maybe because it's good at hiding, and it's good at hunting</p>
<p t="2553980" d="4040">I don't know exactly why, but coyotes are like that, too</p>
<p t="2558020" d="5000">they're classic trickster animals, he's kinda like Wile E. Coyote, in fact</p>
<p t="2563020" d="8140">you know, the Warner Brothers character who's genius at large, and whose arrogance continually gets him wallopped</p>
<p t="2571160" d="8380">and this character has a lot of features like that, but he feigns being an English gentleman of the 1890s</p>
<p t="2579540" d="6960">and pretends to be educated, and has a kinda high-blown way of talking, and he's a fraud through and through</p>
<p t="2586500" d="9220">and he's got this sidekick who's barely there at all, and he doesn't treat him that well</p>
<p t="2595720" d="5060">but he's got someone to lord it over, so that keeps his dominance hierarchy thing going well</p>
<p t="2600780" d="4980">and the fact that he's like a second-rate companion, well, he never really notices that</p>
<p t="2605760" d="2920">although he'll treat him contemptuously whenever he gets a chance</p>
<p t="2608680" d="6900">so anyways, they're walking down the street, and the fox is bragging away about some crooked thing that he's done</p>
<p t="2615580" d="5520">how he pulled the wool over someone's eyes, and he confuses that with wisdom and intelligence</p>
<p t="2621100" d="3840">and one of the things that you see, this is worth knowing too, because</p>
<p t="2624940" d="6220">if you're preyed upon by a psychopath, which you will be to some degree at some point in your life</p>
<p t="2631160" d="5560">the psychopath, who will be narcissistic, will presume that you're stupid</p>
<p t="2636720" d="6000">and that you deserve to be taken advantage of, because you're naive and stupid, so it's actually a good thing that he's doing it</p>
<p t="2642720" d="5840">and his proof... and I'm saying ";he,"; because there are more male psychopaths</p>
<p t="2648560" d="5640">the proof that you're stupid and naive is that he can take advantage of you</p>
<p t="2654200" d="4640">and so, like, if you were wiser, you'd be a, you know, you'd know his tricks</p>
<p t="2658840" d="6040">then it wouldn't be morally necessary for him to show you just exactly who knows what about what</p>
<p t="2664880" d="11220">and so, the psychopath will use his ability  to fool you as proof of his own grandiose omnipotence, omniscience, and narcissism</p>
<p t="2676100" d="5640">and the problem with that is that you can be fooled by a psychopath, and virtually anybody can</p>
<p t="2681740" d="4100">so that Robert Hare, for example, who's studied psychopaths for a long time</p>
<p t="2685840" d="5160">and interviewed a lot of them, like hundreds of them, and videotaped many of the interviews</p>
<p t="2691000" d="2880">he said when he was talking to the psychopath he always believed what they were saying</p>
<p t="2693880" d="4660">and then he's watch the video afterwards, and see where the conversation went off the rails</p>
<p t="2698540" d="7700">but, you know, the proclivity to be polite in a conversation is very strong</p>
<p t="2706240" d="5960">and if you're polite, you don't object to the way that the person unfolds their strategy, you know</p>
<p t="2712200" d="5640">and psychopaths are pretty good at figuring out how to manipulate, obviously, how to manipulate people</p>
<p t="2717840" d="3660">and the probability that you will be immune to that is extraordinarily low</p>
<p t="2721500" d="4640">go watch Paul Bernardo being interviewed by policemen on the Youtube</p>
<p t="2726140" d="7300">that's bloody... that's enlightening, man, Paul Bernardo, he's like the CEO of a meeting in that video</p>
<p t="2733440" d="7480">he gives the cops hell, he gives the lawyers hell, he protests his innocence, he basically tells them that they're rude and untrustworthy</p>
<p t="2740920" d="4360">because they don't trust him, because he did a few little things seventeen years ago</p>
<p t="2745280" d="7080">and he gets away with the few little things, right, I mean he killed a bunch of people, including the sister of his girlfriend at the time</p>
<p t="2752360" d="3440">and you know, he was a repeat sexual offender, and murderer</p>
<p t="2755800" d="6200">but he basically goes: you know, that's a long time ago, it's like, we're past that, aren't we?</p>
<p t="2762000" d="6340">I mean, I'm having a discussion with you, I'm trying to help you solve some crimes, which, by the way, I committed, but we won't bring that up</p>
<p t="2768340" d="5340">you know, and you're accusing me of being a liar, you're not playing fair, what's up with you?</p>
<p t="2773680" d="5060">and then when they answer, he looks at his fingernails, which is, like, that's a lovely little manipulative thing</p>
<p t="2778740" d="7740">'cause it basically means: whatever happens to be under my fingernail at the moment is much higher priority than your foolish story</p>
<p t="2786480" d="4340">and you watch, you'll see people do that to you, and then you get a little insight into what they're up to</p>
<p t="2790820" d="6280">he's very good at that; or he looks outside, or he just looks at his hands, or he looks out the window</p>
<p t="2797100" d="4240">immediately dismissive in his nonverbal behavior, it's brilliant</p>
<p t="2801340" d="6480">the courts were forced to release that, by the way, look it up, Paul Bernardo on Youtube</p>
<p t="2807820" d="4500">wow, it's jus mind-boggling, he's so good at what he does</p>
<p t="2812320" d="4060">and he's good-looking, and he's charismatic, and, you know, he can really pull it off</p>
<p t="2816380" d="6540">and you can't tell what's happening with the cops and the lawyers, whether they're just letting him play his routine to get some information from him</p>
<p t="2822920" d="4340">or whether he's actually setting them back on his heels, and I suspect it's a bit of both</p>
<p t="2827260" d="6880">but it's a masterful performance; if you didn't know who he was, and you were watching it without the audio</p>
<p t="2834140" d="5520">you'd think he's the CEO of some company giving his employees hell for not being up to scratch</p>
<p t="2839660" d="5680">that's all his body language, his eye contact, everything, just speaks that, it's amazing</p>
<p t="2845340" d="4940">so anyways, you got these two-bit hoods here, who think they're really something</p>
<p t="2850280" d="6600">and they also think they're tough and dangerous, and they're not, they're just, you know, cowardly corner dwellers</p>
<p t="2856880" d="7340">and they confuse their unwillingness to abide by reasonable rules with an indication of their heroic courage</p>
<p t="2864220" d="3220">which is something else that low-rent hoods like to do, you know</p>
<p t="2867440" d="5460">and it's partly because lots of people who just attend to the law do do that because they're cowardly</p>
<p t="2872900" d="4040">which is a Nietzschean observation, are you good? or are you just afraid?</p>
<p t="2876940" d="7980">let's start with afraid first, before we proceed to good, and that the reason you follow the rules is that you're afraid of getting caught</p>
<p t="2884920" d="6560">yeah, well, you know those kids who... often university kids who are in a hockey riot</p>
<p t="2891480" d="8700">and breaking windows, and stealing things, you know, they get nailed for it, and afterwards they're really blown away by their own behavior</p>
<p t="2900180" d="6680">it's like, well, they're in that camp, they think they are good people, but they're not, they're just never anywhere where you could be bad</p>
<p t="2906860" d="4740">and as soon as you put them somewhere, where they could be bad, it's like, out it comes, just like that</p>
<p t="2911600" d="8080">and that's really worth thinking about, 'cause most of you, many of you, but not all of you, I suspect</p>
<p t="2919680" d="4800">have never really been somewhere that you could be really bad and get away with it</p>
<p t="2924480" d="6580">and so you might think, well, you wouldn't do it, but people do it, all the time</p>
<p t="2931060" d="3420">so anyways, they're talking about some exploits, and</p>
<p t="2934480" d="5560">then they see that this character named Stomboli, he has a puppet show, right</p>
<p t="2940040" d="3240">and he's kind of a wheeler-dealer too</p>
<p t="2943280" d="5600">remember, I showed you that mas that was glaring at Pinokio when he got his voice?</p>
<p t="2948880" d="6880">it's like, Stromboli is one of his manifestations, the fox here is another one of his manifestations</p>
<p t="2955760" d="4360">all the negative characters throughout the movie are manifestations of the same thing</p>
<p t="2960120" d="5140">it's partly the adversarial individual, and it's partly the tyrrannical aspect of society</p>
<p t="2965260" d="3500">it's the negative masculine, that's one way of thinking about it</p>
<p t="2968760" d="5180">so, and you know, when men go bad, they often go bad by being antisocial and tyrrannical</p>
<p t="2973940" d="6580">there's way more antisocial men than there antisocial women, which is why there's twenty times as many men in jail as there are women</p>
<p t="2980520" d="6120">so each gender, let's say each sex has it's own characteristic pathologies</p>
<p t="2986640" d="5040">and there are some antisocial women, you know, and there are some high-neuroticism guys</p>
<p t="2991680" d="5920">or some guys who are really agreeable as well, but they're rare</p>
<p t="2997600" d="7580">so anyways, he sees this poster advertising Stromboli's puppet show</p>
<p t="3005180" d="7620">so Stromboli's a puppet master; now that's really worth thinking about, because that's an archetypal theme</p>
<p t="3012800" d="7120">or it's at least attached to an archetypal theme: something's behind the scenes, pulling the strings</p>
<p t="3019920" d="5440">and everyone always wonders what that is, what's actually going on; what's actually going on with Trump?</p>
<p t="3025360" d="7220">who's actually in control? is it Putin? I mean that's the fantasies of the left, it's Putin</p>
<p t="3032580" d="5520">it's like, well, the question always is, what's going on behind the scene</p>
<p t="3038100" d="6540">right, and the question is... that's the case certainly on the political landscape, business landscape, interpersonal relations</p>
<p t="3044640" d="5360">what are you really up to, everyone's always wondering that, right, it's why they're watching you eyes</p>
<p t="3050000" d="7600">'cause your eyes point at things, and they can infer what you're interested in, and what you're up to by looking at what you look at</p>
<p t="3057600" d="6020">and that's why your eyes have whites, it's so that we can see where you're pointing them, 'cause gorillas don't</p>
<p t="3063620" d="7320">and so what that means, roughly speaking, is that all of your ancestors whose eyes couldn't be reliably tracked</p>
<p t="3070940" d="6420">were either killed or didn't mate, it's a big deal for us to see where people's eyes are pointed</p>
<p t="3077360" d="4140">and so we're always watching each other's eyes, constantly; what are you up to, what are you up to?</p>
<p t="3081500" d="5820">what are you looking at? what do you want? I wanna know, because if I know what you want, I can predict how you're gonna behave</p>
<p t="3087320" d="5360">and that also means I can cooperate with you, or I can compete with you, or I can lie to you</p>
<p t="3092680" d="8100">but all the information is in the eyes, surrounded by the facial display, right, 'cause that's also an indication of motivation and emotion</p>
<p t="3100780" d="8600">our eyes are so good at that, that for you guys sitting there in the back, I can tell if you're looking at my eyes or at my chin</p>
<p t="3109380" d="8420">and the deviation in your eyes is so tiny, that it's a kind of miracle that we're capable of making that perceptual observation</p>
<p t="3117800" d="4860">it's really important to us, so and we have really good eyes, so that's another thing about us</p>
<p t="3122660" d="7280">so anyways, what's going on behind the scenes? well, if you look at Stromboli, you might be thinking:</p>
<p t="3129940" d="4300">it's not clear he's someone you'd want to have pulling your strings</p>
<p t="3134240" d="7220">there's a little bit of, forced ethusiasm, let's say, there, and he's just not a very savory looking character</p>
<p t="3141460" d="7200">so anyways, the fox knows him, and they start talking about Stromboli, that old joker</p>
<p t="3148660" d="5380">how they could possibly involve him in some sort of scam, because he's back in town</p>
<p t="3154040" d="5680">and then they see the puppet, and the fox does his equivalent of thinking</p>
<p t="3159720" d="4160">which is, you know, pretty sad and nasty, but that's what he does</p>
<p t="3163880" d="3920">and then they see this puppet with no strings, and they think: hey man</p>
<p t="3167800" d="6080">a puppet master would pay a lot for something that is capable of semi-autonomous movement like that</p>
<p t="3173880" d="4280">it would be kind of a miracle; and so they decide that they would take him to Stromboli</p>
<p t="3178160" d="8800">and so they grab him, and, hah, he's got an apple to take to the teacher, which, I think it's the cat, promptly eats</p>
<p t="3186960" d="9980">and the fox acts out this false enthusiasm about what Pinokio is up to, and pretends that he's his friend</p>
<p t="3196940" d="5220">which is of course what your typical pedophile will do, and so this is in the same kind of category</p>
<p t="3202160" d="6980">and it truly is; one of the things that's interesting to know about pedophiles is that they're predatory, right</p>
<p t="3209140" d="7200">and so they don't go after kids that are assertive and likely to be noisy</p>
<p t="3216340" d="6340">they watch, and they watch to see if they can find a kid who's defeated, and...</p>
<p t="3222680" d="6700">that's good enough, who's defeated, and who's gonna need a friend, and who's not going to object</p>
<p t="3229380" d="5180">and so when they check out... these are the ones who do the stranger abductions, which are, by the way, extraordinarily rare</p>
<p t="3234560" d="5460">they look for a victim type, they look for a kid who's gonna be easy to take down</p>
<p t="3240020" d="4780">and so, you know, that's one thing you don't want... so you might think, well...</p>
<p t="3244800" d="5760">one of the things that was really big, it's probably even worse now, when I was a parent of young children</p>
<p t="3250560" d="8580">was to teach your kids how to be afraid of strangers, it's like, uh, no, wrong, that is not what you teach them</p>
<p t="3259140" d="8100">because all you do is teach them then to be timid and fearful, and the real predatory types, they're pretty much thrilled about that</p>
<p t="3267240" d="3840">'cause you'll also make them sheltered and naive</p>
<p t="3271080" d="7400">you make your kids courageous, and you get their damn eyes open, and that's the best thing you can do against people who are truly dangerous</p>
<p t="3278480" d="6200">so, none of that terrifying... it's not a good idea</p>
<p t="3284680" d="8020">anyways, the fox befriends the puppet, and then they come up with this evil scheme to get him off to Stromboli, the puppet master</p>
<p t="3292700" d="5680">and away they go, and they sing a little song about being an actor, ";an actor's life for me";</p>
<p t="3298380" d="6460">this took me along time to figure out, I thought: they're taking Pinokio away to be an actor</p>
<p t="3304840" d="5100">now why in the world are actors getting such a rough time in this movie?</p>
<p t="3309940" d="7000">it's like, it's a Hollywood movie, you know, it's acting, obviously, the voiceovers and all of that are acting</p>
<p t="3316940" d="6160">it's... why is this thing about being an actor? and then I thought: oh, I get it, I see what's going on</p>
<p t="3323100" d="6120">they sing to Pinokio about the delights of unearned celebrity</p>
<p t="3329220" d="4560">so he doesn't have to go and get an education, he doesn't have to take the difficult route</p>
<p t="3333780" d="6900">he can take the easy way to dominance... to success, to dominance success</p>
<p t="3340680" d="7540">he can circumvent all the hard work and go right to the top, you know, and when you think about phenomena like the Kardashian family</p>
<p t="3348220" d="6280">and how popular they are, part of that is this desire that people have for unearned celebrity</p>
<p t="3354500" d="5560">because you can ge to the top without any sacrifices and without any work, and if you're really cynical</p>
<p t="3360060" d="5360">you know, you think that the people at the top are just there by accident anyways, and it might as well be you</p>
<p t="3365420" d="8000">of course, there's a lot of naivety in that as well, and a fair bit of, you know... a fair lack of wisdom and all of that</p>
<p t="3373420" d="5960">but the actor idea here is that you can pretend to be something you're not</p>
<p t="3379380" d="5640">and that that's the proper route of anyone wise to success, it's the ultimate in cynicism</p>
<p t="3385020" d="4960">and it's a nihilistic perspective as well, and that's how they entrap him</p>
<p t="3389980" d="4860">they say: look, why are you bothering to go to school? that's gonna take 18 years</p>
<p t="3394840" d="5760">with all of your talents you could just go on the stage, your name will be up in lights, you'll be at the top in no time</p>
<p t="3400600" d="6120">and what does the puppet know? plust he does have some talents, he is, after all, a semi-autonomous puppet</p>
<p t="3406720" d="6040">now, he doesn't exactly know how special that makes him, but the fox can obviously see something in him</p>
<p t="3412760" d="5080">and he's good at playing that naivety off, and then offering these false promises</p>
<p t="3417840" d="5420">but, see, the thing is... one of the things that Carl Jung said, that I thought  was really interesting</p>
<p t="3423260" d="4100">when he was talking about the Edipal situation in families, I never forgot this</p>
<p t="3427360" d="5540">so the Edipal situation, roughly speaking, is when - I'll lay out the classic story -</p>
<p t="3432900" d="5500">is when a child is seriously overprotected, usually a male child by his mother</p>
<p t="3438400" d="3820">now, the reverse can be the case, and it can be a female child by the mother, and all of that</p>
<p t="3442220" d="2940">but I'll just talk about the classic case to begin with</p>
<p t="3445160" d="5220">now, what Freud observed was that there were usually not very good boundaries in families like that</p>
<p t="3450380" d="4940">and so, the relationship between the husband and the wife was either strained or nonexistent</p>
<p t="3455320" d="5100">and the wife would often turn to the child to be what she isn't getting from the husband</p>
<p t="3460420" d="5580">and so, there's a great South Park episode about this, a wonderful South Park episode</p>
<p t="3466000" d="6740">where... I don't remember that horrible little guy 
[student: Cartman] 
yeah, that's him</p>
<p t="3472740" d="6280">his mother brings in the dog whisperer to train him, and it's a brilliant episode</p>
<p t="3479020" d="5760">if you want to learn about the freudian edipal situation, you watch that, you've got it down cold</p>
<p t="3484780" d="4520">because she brings in this expert, who then she wants to have an affair with, so that's a boundary issue</p>
<p t="3489300" d="8720">and he basically separates her son from him [sic], and imposes the same discipline on him, that he would impose on a bad dog</p>
<p t="3498020" d="6280">although he also trains the dog's owners all the time, because maybe it's not the dog, maybe it's the owner</p>
<p t="3504300" d="5740">there's a horse whisperer movie, too, about the original horse whisperer that does a beautiful job of laying that out, too</p>
<p t="3510040" d="7880">'cause he's very good at fixing problem horses, and unbelivably good at diagnosing psychopathology on the part of the owner</p>
<p t="3517920" d="2520">he's got a gift for it, but...</p>
<p t="3520440" d="7160">anyways, what happens in the South Park episode is that the dog whisperer gets Cartman straightened out</p>
<p t="3527600" d="3620">and he starts, like, dressing properly, and doing his homework, and...</p>
<p t="3531220" d="4100">and the mother is pursuing an affair with the dog whisperer, but he's professional</p>
<p t="3535320" d="3280">he keeps his distance, he keeps boundaries around him</p>
<p t="3538600" d="4440">and then he leaves, and then the first thing that she does when he leaves</p>
<p t="3543040" d="7960">is bribe Cartman, basically, out of doing his homework, so that he can accompany her to, I don't know, a fast food restaurant or something like that</p>
<p t="3551000" d="4580">and so, the reason she does that is 'cause she's lonesome, and doesn't have anybody else around</p>
<p t="3555580" d="7040">and, you know, maybe she's also deeply, deeply, deeply terrified that if she helps that boy grow up, he will leave</p>
<p t="3562620" d="2000">and she'll have nothing</p>
<p t="3564620" d="5020">you know, and so, mothers who don't have something, say, outside their infants</p>
<p t="3569640" d="4000">not merely their children, are more likely to fall into that, and it's no wonder</p>
<p t="3573640" d="7400">you know, you gotta think that through; and lots of women, most women, really fall in love with their babies</p>
<p t="3581040" d="4440">and so, even if they start growing into larger children that can be threatening</p>
<p t="3585480" d="7540">because when the child... when the infant turns into a toddler, the infant is dead</p>
<p t="3593020" d="7420">the toddler is there now; and you can radically interfere with that process, that happens all the time</p>
<p t="3600440" d="2960">that's the classic Freudian oedipal nightmare</p>
<p t="3603400" d="4080">and that episode is brilliant, it's bloody brilliant, it just nails it</p>
<p t="3607480" d="4520">some of you've been in my personality class and watched ";Crumb";, the documentary ";Crumb";</p>
<p t="3612000" d="5240">and that's another staggering exposition of exactly that kind of pathology</p>
<p t="3617240" d="3280">anyways, one of the things Jung pointed out...</p>
<p t="3620520" d="5200">so I knew this guys once, who had a mother who basically was trying that trick</p>
<p t="3625720" d="5840">and she was very smart, and had lots of tricks up her sleeves, and there was just no way he was gonna go for it</p>
<p t="3631560" d="5840">he rebelled at every possible moment, and he basically became, I would say, somewhat hypermasculine in response</p>
<p t="3637400" d="6540">which is an interesting lesson with regards to the hypermasculinity that boys often develop when they're raised by single mothers</p>
<p t="3643940" d="2200">'cause they tend to go one of two ways</p>
<p t="3646140" d="4160">and he just fought her at every step of the way, and it didn't happen</p>
<p t="3650300" d="5100">but one of the things Jung said, which I loved, and you can really see this in the ";Crumb"; documentary</p>
<p t="3655400" d="4980">is that the oedipal mother basically entices the child, she says: look</p>
<p t="3660380" d="5580">here's the deal, you don't have to do anything, but you don't get to leave</p>
<p t="3665960" d="4300">and if you don't leave, and you don't to these difficult things, then I'll take care of you</p>
<p t="3670260" d="7020">and the child has a choice, all the way along there, I mean, obviously he's outclassed in some sense, but it's not as obvious as you'd think</p>
<p t="3677280" d="3440">little kids are tough, and they make decisions all the time</p>
<p t="3680720" d="5400">and so Jung thought about it more as a conspiracy than as something imposed on the child by the mother</p>
<p t="3686120" d="4520">and I really like that, it's actually a conspiracy between mother, father, and child, actually</p>
<p t="3690640" d="3500">and I think that's a good way of looking at it, even though it's really rough, 'cause</p>
<p t="3694140" d="6420">well, should you hold the child responsible? well, yes, but judiciously, and not completely</p>
<p t="3700560" d="4660">'cause then if you deal with someone like that as an adult, and they're trying to escape from it</p>
<p t="3705220" d="3920">you have to go all the way back and figure out how the hell it happened</p>
<p t="3709140" d="5420">they have to figure out where they opened the door, like inviting a vampire in</p>
<p t="3714560" d="4320">'cause they can't come in unless you invite them in, so don't invite them in</p>
<p t="3718880" d="4640">'cause once they're in they're really hard to  get rid of, and they'll take all your blood</p>
<p t="3723520" d="2480">so that's a cautionary tale</p>
<p t="3726000" d="5380">so anyways, Pinokio doesn't know any better, and he's got the egotism of youth</p>
<p t="3731380" d="6480">he's offered the easy way to success, which is exactly what the fox tells him, and off they go to see Stromboli</p>
<p t="3737860" d="4440">so this is this song, I'm not gonna read it all</p>
<p t="3742300" d="5780">it's great to be a celebrity, an actor's life for me</p>
<p t="3748080" d="6200">you sleep till after two
you promenade a big cigar
you tour the world in a private car</p>
<p t="3754280" d="3160">you dine on chicken and caviar
an actor's life for me!</p>
<p t="3757440" d="4200">it's all this idea of wealth and public exposure</p>
<p t="3761640" d="5980">and zero attention whatsoever to anything regarding responsibility or discipline or learning</p>
<p t="3767620" d="5220">and so it's a dual attraction, right, you get everything you want, and you don't have to do anything</p>
<p t="3772840" d="5300">geez, what a deal; and so that's what the actor represents, it's a liar, fundamentally</p>
<p t="3778140" d="5600">it's someone who's acting out a deception, they're a persona in the Jungian sense</p>
<p t="3783740" d="7400">so the persona is the mask you wear in public that you might even think you are. but you're not</p>
<p t="3791140" d="3220">it's this mask, and that's the actor, that's the persona</p>
<p t="3794360" d="5960">so the fox and the cat are inviting the puppet to only become a persona</p>
<p t="3800320" d="10160">see, for Jung, you start as a persona, and then, when you start to investigate the parts of you that don't really fit in that persona</p>
<p t="3810480" d="3800">and that would be the shadow, then you start understanding who you really are</p>
<p t="3814280" d="5960">and that's shocking, because the persona contains everything, roughly speaking, that you think is good</p>
<p t="3820240" d="2960">and maybe even that your immediate culture thinks is good</p>
<p t="3823200" d="2940">and then the shadow contains everything's that's not part of that</p>
<p t="3826140" d="5960">and some of that's really bad, but some of it is good disguised as bad</p>
<p t="3832100" d="6120">and you can't break out of the persona and transcend it until you incorporate a lot of what's in the shadow</p>
<p t="3838220" d="5960">and so, for example, it you're and extrordinarily compassionate person, let's say 98th percentile</p>
<p t="3844180" d="4260">you're going to be sacrificing yourself to other people all the time</p>
<p t="3848440" d="3720">and there are people who will find that extraordinarily endearing</p>
<p t="3852160" d="5400">and it will be, under some circumstances, but the problem is that you will sacrifice yourself</p>
<p t="3857560" d="3980">and that's a really bad attitude to have, for example, towards adult males</p>
<p t="3861540" d="3900">it's a great thing for infants, but for adult males it is *the* wrong approach</p>
<p t="3865440" d="7600">you will get taken advantage of continually by people who are looking for someone like you, until you grow some teeth</p>
<p t="3873040" d="7600">and you'll think: no, no, that's the opposite of compassion, being able to bite hard is the opposite of compassion</p>
<p t="3880640" d="4420">which it is; and so you'll have that pushed into the predator category</p>
<p t="3885060" d="3180">";I'm not doing that, I'm not getting angry, I don't like conflict";</p>
<p t="3888300" d="6800">until you bring that out of the depths and put it on, so you can use it, you're gonna be in trouble</p>
<p t="3895160" d="3540">and that's kinda Nietzsche's idea of the revaluation of good and evil</p>
<p t="3898700" d="5880">you have a sense of what's good, and a sense of what isn't with your conscience, but it's not very smart</p>
<p t="3904580" d="4280">it's got things in the wrong boxes, even nature itself</p>
<p t="3908860" d="5180">a lot of the things that you accept as untrammeled goods, like compassion, let's say</p>
<p t="3914040" d="5400">have a very dark side, first of all, and second, are not enough to get you through life</p>
<p t="3919440" d="3900">you need the opposite virtues, too, and so you have to develop them</p>
<p t="3923340" d="4220">you get outside the persona to do that</p>
<p t="3927560" d="6840">but anyways, Pinokio's invited to be a false persona to take the gains of celebrity</p>
<p t="3934400" d="5340">without having to do anything to be educated, he's just gonna go right to the top from right where he is</p>
<p t="3939740" d="5940">and you know, people are kinda fascinated by that idea, that's why you watch America's Got Talent</p>
<p t="3945680" d="3480">or the X-Factor, which shows I actually love, by the way</p>
<p t="3949160" d="8820">you never see narcissism in its purer forms than you see it when you watch people who display an absolute lack of talent</p>
<p t="3957980" d="3500">and become homicidal when someone dares point it out</p>
<p t="3961480" d="4560">accusatory and homicidal, instantly, it's really something</p>
<p t="3966060" d="6400">and then, now and then, you do see one of these people who's so introverted, and so out of society</p>
<p t="3972460" d="4540">and have this unbelievable gift, which is also something really remarkable to see</p>
<p t="3977000" d="6580">and it's no wonder these things are so popular, they're psychologically extraordinarily interesting</p>
<p t="3983580" d="7080">so that's the actor, first of Pinokio's temptations, and of course it's the first one, because he's entering the social world</p>
<p t="3990660" d="4740">and the temptation in the social world is to be exactly what other people want you to be</p>
<p t="3995400" d="3600">and the thing that's cool about that is that is what you should be doing</p>
<p t="3999000" d="7880">when you go out in your peers, you should be not subjugating your individuality to your peers, 'cause that's not exactly right</p>
<p t="4006880" d="5740">that's kinda based on an inhibition model, you've got aggression, you've got bad habits, they have to be inhibited</p>
<p t="4012620" d="5680">you learn that by interacting with your peers;
it's not the right model, that's a Freudian model</p>
<p t="4018300" d="4860">Piaget was correct about that, he basically pointed out that what should happen is</p>
<p t="4023160" d="5140">let's say, with your aggression, and hopefully you have some, is that it gets socialized</p>
<p t="4028300" d="5860">you learn how to play games, but you don't drop your drive to win, you integrate that in the games</p>
<p t="4034160" d="6740">you try to win, you try to play hard, but if you're defeated or you hit something negative, you don't respond negatively</p>
<p t="4040900" d="5500">and you can keep that all bounded within being a good player, a fair player</p>
<p t="4046400" d="5180">and that means what's happened is you learned how to play a game or a set of games</p>
<p t="4051580" d="5520">that also includes the darker parts of you, and they actually become part of your force of character</p>
<p t="4057100" d="4820">it's way better if you can pull that off, and that's what you definitely wanna do as an adult</p>
<p t="4061920" d="5740">all you people are gonna have to learn to negotiate on your own behalf, and that's really hard</p>
<p t="4067660" d="6940">it means that you have to know what you want, you have to be able to communicate it, and you have to be able to say ";no";</p>
<p t="4074600" d="5360">and to say ";no"; you have to be built on a solid foundation, you have to have options</p>
<p t="4079960" d="2660">so you gotta remember that as you go through your life</p>
<p t="4082620" d="5860">if you don't have options, you can't negotiate with someone, and if you're not willing to use them, they win, period</p>
<p t="4088480" d="5660">because if you're asking your boss for more money, say, the answer is no</p>
<p t="4094140" d="6420">because he doesn't have any spare money lying around that he can just give to you, and lots of other people are asking</p>
<p t="4100560" d="6560">so some of that zero-sum stuff, not all of it, because often you cooperate with people, and the whole pot can grow</p>
<p t="4107120" d="4220">but some of it's zero-sum, and so you better have a case made</p>
<p t="4111340" d="7900">";here's how much money I should have, here's why, here's the benefit to you if you do it</p>
<p t="4119240" d="6360">here's the consequences if you don't, they're actually real, they will cost you, and I will do them";</p>
<p t="4125600" d="6300">then you can negotiate, and you don't do that rudely, but those arguments, you better have them in order</p>
<p t="4131900" d="4680">for example, if you're gonna negotiate for a raise or a status shift</p>
<p t="4136580" d="7020">you better have your resume at hand, all polished up, and know where else you're gonna look for a job, and you better be able to get one</p>
<p t="4143600" d="4380">'cause otherwise you're weak, and you will not win the negotiation</p>
<p t="4147980" d="6620">and if you're too agreeable, so your conflict-avoidant, you will make less money across time</p>
<p t="4154600" d="5700">that's already been well established, and that's because you don't have teeth, not enough</p>
<p t="4160300" d="4800">and so, in the little micro-contest that you're going to have every day</p>
<p t="4165100" d="4100">you're going to incrementally lose to people who are more aggressive</p>
<p t="4169200" d="7220">who have bigger teeth, and that's what happens, so don't let that happen</p>
<p t="4176420" d="7220">you place yourselves so you can negotiate, 'cause otherwise you're just a facade</p>
<p t="4183640" d="8940">and in a real battle a facade is just torn down right away</p>
<p t="4192580" d="6960">well, the cricket, he's supposed to be helping the puppet out, but he overslept</p>
<p t="4199540" d="5980">that's just another indication that he's not everything he could be yet, and that's really...</p>
<p t="4205520" d="3340">that took me a long time to puzzle out with regards to interpreting this movie</p>
<p t="4208860" d="6280">I could not figure out, I told you this, if the bug is the person who opens the hero narrative</p>
<p t="4215140" d="5580">and who can guide the transformations of time and who has the same initials as Jesus Chris</p>
<p t="4220720" d="4100">and is knighted by nature herself,
why is he such an idiot?</p>
<p t="4224820" d="6340">it's a very difficult thing to figure out, but the idea that the conscience isn't omniscient</p>
<p t="4231160" d="4140">even though it has that voice of, let's say, common sense</p>
<p t="4235300" d="6680">and that fits very nicely in with the Freudian idea of the superego, again, because the superego can be flawed</p>
<p t="4241980" d="3900">it can be too harsh, it can not be properly developed</p>
<p t="4245880" d="7400">you see that often with people who are orderly, so they're high in conscientiousness, conscientiousness fragments into industriousness and orderliness</p>
<p t="4253280" d="6000">orderly people like willpower, they're very judgmental, and they like things to be exactly where they're supposed to be</p>
<p t="4259280" d="6160">but they're also very self-punitive; conservatives are much more likely to be orderly, by the way</p>
<p t="4265440" d="7380">it's one of the best predictors of conservatism; low openness is the best predictor, but right after that is high orderliness</p>
<p t="4272820" d="8000">and it's associated with disgust sensitivity, which is really an amazing thing, we'll talk about that later</p>
<p t="4280820" d="5500">anyways, the cricket, he falls down his first day on the job</p>
<p t="4286320" d="6820">he's not as conscientious a conscience as he should be</p>
<p t="4293140" d="6500">so he's feeling pretty stupid, he's got his little millionaire clothes on, but he's really not living up to them</p>
<p t="4299640" d="8920">he does catch up to the fox and the puppet, however, and tries to dissuade Pinokio from going down this road</p>
<p t="4308560" d="5460">and of course, the cat, well, you can see what the cat's doing there, he's got a big hammer</p>
<p t="4314020" d="5360">big mallet, and he's... it also shows you just exactly how much of a clue he has</p>
<p t="4319380" d="4740">he's gonna wallop the bug who's sitting on the fox's hat, which I think he actually does</p>
<p t="4324120" d="6520">then the fox can't get out of his hat, and has to talk through his hat, which basically he's doing all the time anyways</p>
<p t="4330640" d="8700">so, this I really like, you see on the left here that the cricket is speaking inside this flower</p>
<p t="4339340" d="5280">and like I said, there's nothing accidental in these representations</p>
<p t="4344620" d="5400">these are artists who were coming up with these compositions, and their fantasy has a structure</p>
<p t="4350020" d="7420">so the cricket is speaking out of this flower that has, well, you could think about it as... it has a sexualized element</p>
<p t="4357440" d="5980">so you could think about that as a phallic part, and that part of the feminine part of it, they are flowers, after all</p>
<p t="4363420" d="7280">they are the sex organs of plants, and that's very much the same over here, this is the yoni and lingam</p>
<p t="4370700" d="7520">this is from Hindu culture, and you see there's a snake wrapped around that, so that's masculine and feminine</p>
<p t="4378220" d="5860">with a snake wrapped around it, and that's a holy representation, a sacred representation</p>
<p t="4384080" d="5220">and it represents the deepst reality, that's one way of thinking about it</p>
<p t="4389300" d="4140">like chaos and order, surrounded by the snake, it's exactly the same idea</p>
<p t="4393440" d="5520">so the cricket speaks out of that; well we already know that, 'cause it is the conscience</p>
<p t="4398960" d="7200">and he's been awakened in part by Gepetto and the good father, and awakened in part by the good fairy and nature</p>
<p t="4406160" d="7620">so he speaks with those voices, and he's also a manifestation of the underlying chaos itself</p>
<p t="4413780" d="3140">because nature and culture spring out of chaos</p>
<p t="4416920" d="4800">I already showed you that schematic representation</p>
<p t="4421720" d="6520">I'll just end this scene, and then we'll have a 15-minute break, okay?</p>
<p t="4428240" d="6680">anyways, the cricket tires to make a case for why Pinokio shouldn't go off to be a celebrity</p>
<p t="4434920" d="7680">but, you know, it's a hard case to make, because the fox is very manipulative, and Pinokio is naive</p>
<p t="4442600" d="5980">and it sounds like a good offer, and also the fox is actually quite forceful, he basically takes him by the hand</p>
<p t="4448580" d="4760">so the temptation is, and this is something else I like about the movie</p>
<p t="4453340" d="3460">you can't just say: ";well, the puppet gets what he deserves";</p>
<p t="4456800" d="6360">'cause he's little and naive, and what he's facing is really malevolent, truly malevolent</p>
<p t="4463160" d="8160">and physically overpowering, and so the movie does a nice job of not minimizing the threat that's posed by this particular temptation</p>
<p t="4471320" d="2860">and that's part of what makes it art</p>
<p t="4474180" d="6200">so we'll stop there, we'll have a break for 15 minutes, and then we'll start with the stage</p>
<p t="4480380" d="7160">alright, so here we are, at the big event, and Pinokio is off to be a celebrity</p>
<p t="4487540" d="7680">and the cricket is watching, and Pinokio basically...</p>
<p t="4495220" d="4880">well, he's got some natural talent, because he's a puppet, but he doesn't have strings</p>
<p t="4500100" d="4920">he goes on stage with strings, and then he drops his strings, and the whole crowd is amazed</p>
<p t="4505020" d="5280">and the crowd should be amazed when that happens; you can imagine when a kid goes to school</p>
<p t="4510300" d="9100">and shows some independence, that that's actually gonna... people are gonna notice that</p>
<p t="4519400" d="3600">his peers are gonna notice that, the teachers are gonna notice that</p>
<p t="4523000" d="4740">maybe it's too much independence even, but it's still a... it is a remarkable thing, too</p>
<p t="4527740" d="7720">it's so interesting, you can see marked signs of independence in children, well, right from the time they're born, basically</p>
<p t="4535460" d="5700">because one of the things that's really funny about the infants, is when they're crying, you always think:</p>
<p t="4541160" d="6640">";oh, the baby's sad";, it's like, no, a lot of the time that baby is angry</p>
<p t="4547800" d="8520">and the way that we know that is because you can do facial expression coding on infants, just like on adults</p>
<p t="4556320" d="3420">and you can tell what emotion they're expressing, and very frequently...</p>
<p t="4559740" d="4040">like when a kid starts to recognize his mom explicitly</p>
<p t="4563780" d="4980">'cause he or she knows the smell right away, pretty much, and the sound of the voice, but visually</p>
<p t="4568760" d="6540">if someone comes in and it isn't who the baby wants, so generally it isn't mom</p>
<p t="4575300" d="6460">the baby will start to cry, but it's not 'cause the baby's sad, generally, it's because it's angry that mom didn't show up</p>
<p t="4581760" d="4420">and that's an early sign of will, it's like this kid wants things</p>
<p t="4586180" d="3620">and it's perfectly willing to tell you about</p>
<p t="4589800" d="4460">and of course a two-year-old who's having a temper tantrum is in some sense doing the same thing</p>
<p t="4594260" d="5960">it's poorly integrated will and independence, obviously, but it certainly runs contrary to what you want</p>
<p t="4600220" d="3640">you don't want your two-year-old having a temper tantrum in the middle of the toy store</p>
<p t="4603860" d="6300">it's extraordinarily embarrassing for you and... well, for you, but it's also embarrassing for the two-year-old</p>
<p t="4610160" d="5880">this is one of the reasons I think that that sort of thing should be carefully socialized rapidly</p>
<p t="4616040" d="3840">because it's actually humiliating for the kid, 'cause other people don't like that</p>
<p t="4619880" d="4560">and they're very judgmental about it, they won't say anything, usually, but sometimes they will</p>
<p t="4624440" d="4920">but they're not happy about the fact that that's happening, and they will judge the child negatively</p>
<p t="4629360" d="6940">so you don't want your child to be behaving in a way in public that makes other people think badly of them</p>
<p t="4636300" d="9460">it's really, really not good, and so part of your job as a parent is to not expose your child to that sort of experience</p>
<p t="4645760" d="3520">especially not repeatedly, it's really hard on them</p>
<p t="4649280" d="3540">or they get narcissistic, which is also rally hard on them</p>
<p t="4652820" d="2600">it just takes a lot longer to manifest itself</p>
<p t="4655420" d="6260">so anyways, he's off on stage and Stromboli introduces him and talks about how wonderful this is going to be</p>
<p t="4661680" d="3920">and Pinokio comes out on stage with the strings on, and drops them</p>
<p t="4665600" d="3540">and then he falls down the steps and puts his nose into a hole, makes a fool out of himself</p>
<p t="4669140" d="7820">and that's the first time Stromboli shows his true character, 'cause he just really yells and screams at him</p>
<p t="4676960" d="6300">and he has his back to the audience, Stromboli, while he's doing this, so he's not noticing how the audience is reacting</p>
<p t="4683260" d="6600">typical tyrannical parent, right, who's not noticing that society is reacting a different way than him</p>
<p t="4689860" d="5460">he's not happy about it, and Pinokio of course is dazed and feels like a fool, and he is a fool</p>
<p t="4695320" d="7980">so that's appropriate; but then Stromboli hears the crowd laughing, and as soon as he turns around he's all smiles again</p>
<p t="4703300" d="4480">so that's the first time you get insight into what sort of puppet master he is</p>
<p t="4707780" d="5240">he's there to please the crowd and that's all, and he's there to look good in public, but fundamentally he's a tyrant</p>
<p t="4713020" d="7980">and I guess that's the problem with false celebrity, that the negative spirit of the crowd becomes your master</p>
<p t="4721000" d="6900">because to be a celebrity, you have to be a crowd pleaser, and if you're pleasing the kind of crowd who likes a celebrity like you</p>
<p t="4727900" d="8720">which is... and there's not much reason for that, then it's not exactly like you're appealing to the proper side of the crowd</p>
<p t="4736620" d="4960">and you've become its puppet one way or another, and maybe it's rewarding you with wealth, perhaps</p>
<p t="4741580" d="7360">and with attention, but fundamentally it's not something I would recommend</p>
<p t="4748940" d="6080">if you want to stay reasonably psychologically healthy for any reasonable amount of time; you're gonna sell yourself out</p>
<p t="4755020" d="4560">and I don't mean that in any casual way, you know</p>
<p t="4759580" d="5940">all right, so anyways, Stromboli changes from the tyrant to the good father in half a second</p>
<p t="4765520" d="4700">he gives Pinokio a pat on the head despite the fact that he's made a mistake, looks all kind</p>
<p t="4770220" d="4420">and the show continues; now, the cricket is not very happy about this</p>
<p t="4774640" d="6280">he's sitting in the stage, watching, he's very  angry and, let's say, disgusted by what's happening</p>
<p t="4780920" d="5040">partly because Pinokio is making a fool of himself; now that's an interesting thing</p>
<p t="4785960" d="8380">human beings blush, in fact, if I remember correctly, the name Adam, you know, like Adam and Eve</p>
<p t="4794340" d="6260">is related to the capacity to blush; now that comes from something I read a long time ago, and that might be wrong</p>
<p t="4800600" d="5820">but Adam does manifest shame in the sight of God, so there is a relationship there</p>
<p t="4806420" d="5820">but anyways, people do make foold of themselves for public display</p>
<p t="4812240" d="4200">and you can tell you've done that in some sense, not always, if you blush</p>
<p t="4816440" d="5320">because you've either said something you shoulnd't've and you realize that</p>
<p t="4821760" d="5440">which is more like you've tried to be funny and gone a little bit too far, and sometimes that can be really funny</p>
<p t="4827200" d="7380">or you've said something you know to be false, manipulative, deceitful, beneath you</p>
<p t="4834580" d="5000">any of those things, and you'll have an automatic response to it, you'll be ashamed and blush</p>
<p t="4839580" d="7300">one theory about that is you can trust people who blush, because you know that their conscience will betray them</p>
<p t="4846880" d="4760">and so that even if they are lying, they tell you; it's an interesting theory</p>
<p t="4851640" d="5940">because blush is definitely... like it's a facial display, it's right out there, where people can see it</p>
<p t="4857580" d="4500">you know, maybe that's true, maybe it isn't, but it's kind of an interesting idea</p>
<p t="4862080" d="3720">anyways, the cricket is not happy with what's going on, he's not happy about Stromboli</p>
<p t="4865800" d="6880">and he's not happy about the willingness of Pinokio to make a fool of himself to support this false celebrity</p>
<p t="4872680" d="8280">I actually think that's why celebrity types like that often get narcissistic and arrogant</p>
<p t="4880960" d="8880">it's because they aren't paying attention really to what's happening inside them, they drown it out</p>
<p t="4889840" d="5520">because the glory and the money, and all that is so attractive and enticing</p>
<p t="4895360" d="3580">they refuse to notice what price they're paying for it</p>
<p t="4898940" d="4960">and they magnify up their grandiosity and their arrogance to keep that stuff all under control</p>
<p t="4903900" d="3720">and then of course they get surrounded by sycophants, which is a really bad thing</p>
<p t="4907620" d="4900">they get surrounded by people who will tell them exactly what they wanna hear</p>
<p t="4912520" d="3920">and that's really bad if what you wanna hear from other people is not good for you</p>
<p t="4916440" d="7660">to surround yourself with people who won't offer you genuine criticism, or even genuine reward, it's the same thing</p>
<p t="4924100" d="7620">you want from me that I differentially reward and punish you in approximately the way that the good part of the crowd will</p>
<p t="4931720" d="2400">that's what you want from all your friends</p>
<p t="4934120" d="5660">because then your interactions with them can generalize out to the broader community in a productive way</p>
<p t="4939780" d="5840">and so a good friend... your friends tend to be on the supportive side, and perhaps that's appropriate</p>
<p t="4945620" d="5360">assuming there's reciprocity; but a good friend will also tell you when one way or another</p>
<p t="4950980" d="4480">when your behavior is starting to tilt in a direction that's going to make you unpopular with them</p>
<p t="4955460" d="6980">and likely unpopular with other people; and that's the prime job of a parent, in my estimation</p>
<p t="4962440" d="5920">like: ";don't do that, other people will hurt you if you do that</p>
<p t="4968360" d="6960">by exclusion, by threat, by failure to offer you an opportunity, bad things will happen to you";</p>
<p t="4975320" d="5460">so you can't do that; and then you're a representative of the social situation</p>
<p t="4980780" d="4260">which is exactly what you should be, not a friend</p>
<p t="4985040" d="7160">or at least not precisely a friend, that doesn't make you an enemy, it makes you better than a friend</p>
<p t="4992200" d="7320">so Pinokio's on stage making a fool out of himself, and then he gets all tangled up in other puppets' strings</p>
<p t="4999520" d="6940">that's what happens to him, and then it all ends rather badly with everything being a tangled mess on stage</p>
<p t="5006460" d="5880">but it also turns out to be rather funny; it's funny, 'cause he's surrounded by angry Russians</p>
<p t="5012340" d="7480">you could kind of view that as a potential lesson, that if you're a puppet on a stage, and you mess around too much</p>
<p t="5019820" d="5780">you just might get tangled up with a bunch of angry Russians, these are Cossacks, that's exactly what happens</p>
<p t="5025600" d="5620">of course, no, that's not what's happening here, but it's still funny</p>
<p t="5031220" d="7680">so Stromboli is not happy with the tangled mess, but then the crowd reacts very positively</p>
<p t="5038900" d="6760">and that confuses the conscience, because he thinks: ";well, look, this is horrible, this guy's a tyrant, Pinokio's making a fool of himself</p>
<p t="5045660" d="3920">everything turns into a tangled mess, but the crowd goes crazy";</p>
<p t="5049580" d="4560">being a fool, that can be entertaining, right?</p>
<p t="5054140" d="6080">so it's hard to tell when a crowd, especially at a spectacle, 'cause this crowd is at a spectacle</p>
<p t="5060220" d="6260">you just don't know exactly why it is that they're responding positively, but you've definitely given them what they want</p>
<p t="5066480" d="7580">you can see this look on Stromboli's face, it's like this false false kindness and generosity, public facing</p>
<p t="5074060" d="6000">anyways, the conscience is very confused, and I really think this is an important thing</p>
<p t="5080060" d="3540">'cause I've often thought... I spent a lot of time thinking about Hitler, and I was thinking:</p>
<p t="5083600" d="9080">how do you get into a state like that? and you think: he's a dictator, and he led his people down a bad path</p>
<p t="5092680" d="7820">that's not right, that is not what happened; they had a conspiracy together, and went down a bad path</p>
<p t="5100500" d="7720">think about it this way: if one person thinks something about you, it's like whatever, right?</p>
<p t="5108220" d="8420">but if 5 people tell you that, then to start not taking that seriously is kind of narcissistic</p>
<p t="5116640" d="5400">and if it isn't 5, let's say it's 15 people tell you the same thing or act the same way towards you</p>
<p t="5122040" d="6120">it's like probably you should clue in; well, what if you're a politician</p>
<p t="5128160" d="5040">and you're trying out a bunch of different ideas, and you're good at interacting with a crowd</p>
<p t="5133200" d="5000">you're charismatic, you watch the crowd, but you're not necessarily all that articulate</p>
<p t="5138200" d="3080">you don't have your values all straightened out, but you're kinda angry, too</p>
<p t="5141280" d="6200">and maybe that's 'cause you spent a bunch of time in World War I in the trenches, which was like no joke</p>
<p t="5147480" d="3860">and all your friends got blown up; and then you were unemployed</p>
<p t="5151340" d="3540">and then you tried to be an artist, and that didn't work out, even though you were moderately talented</p>
<p t="5154880" d="4620">and then maybe the economy fell apart completely on you, hyperinflation</p>
<p t="5159500" d="5160">and then maybe there was a communist menace coming in from the east, and there genuinely was</p>
<p t="5164660" d="6440">so you're not the world's happiest clam at that point,  and you're talking to people who aren't that happy either</p>
<p t="5171100" d="5580">'cause they were also badly defeated in World War I, and they had a terrible treaty they had to sign, and they lost part of their territory</p>
<p t="5176680" d="6700">and so the crowd's not happy, and neither are you, and there's reason for it; and so you start talking to them</p>
<p t="5183380" d="3120">and you don't know what you're upset about, and neither does the crowd</p>
<p t="5186500" d="5400">so you start to articulate some things about why you might be upset, and some of them fall flat</p>
<p t="5191900" d="3580">but you're paying attention to the crowd, so you stop saying those things</p>
<p t="5195480" d="6900">and some of the things make the crowd really wake up and listen, and so you start saying more of those things</p>
<p t="5202380" d="5680">it's an unconscious dialectic between you and the crowd; it's mediated by consciousness</p>
<p t="5208060" d="5280">but it's not like you're sitting there, saying, although you might be: ";I'm gonna tell this crowd more of what it wants to hear";</p>
<p t="5213340" d="7700">it's more sophisticated than that; and so you do that a thousand times, and you do that to ever-increasing crowds</p>
<p t="5221040" d="6360">and the crowd really starts to go mad, and they basically tell you that you're the savior of the nation</p>
<p t="5227400" d="5980">how many bloody people have to tell you that before you start to believe it?</p>
<p t="5233380" d="4980">I would say, with a typical person, a hundred would do it</p>
<p t="5238360" d="6640">that'll get you going, man, if a hundred people tell you specifically why you're special, you're gonna be thinkin'...</p>
<p t="5245000" d="4800">even if you're humble to begin with, you're gonna be thinking: ";geez, there's gotta be something to this, man";</p>
<p t="5249800" d="5040">but if it's a million people, and they're roaring their approval, well...</p>
<p t="5254840" d="3680">and then when it's a whole nation, good luck withstanding that</p>
<p t="5258520" d="4580">there's just not a chance, how are you going to withstand that?</p>
<p t="5263100" d="6020">now, you could be like Ghandi, and you could've taken that into account beforehand, because he did</p>
<p t="5269120" d="4860">he read Tolstoy, by the way, he was a student of Tolstoy, and that's very interesting</p>
<p t="5273980" d="7760">because Tolstoy developed the techniques of non-violence that Ghandi used; and Tolstoy was also a deeply religious writer</p>
<p t="5281740" d="7320">apart from his novels, which are not, I wouldn't say, really in the religious category, although they're profound</p>
<p t="5289060" d="9920">Tolstoy stressed humility with non-violence, he really stressed it, and that's what Ghandi took to heart</p>
<p t="5298980" d="4780">so he lived a very, very, very simple, bare-bones, ascetic life</p>
<p t="5303760" d="6680">and that was to kinda see if he could keep his damn ego tapped down while the groundswell was building behind him</p>
<p t="5310440" d="4160">you know, and he dressed really simply, and he didn't own much, and he ate very simply</p>
<p t="5314600" d="4040">and he just tried to stay away from the whole materialistic success element</p>
<p t="5318640" d="3820">that would be an element of what would turn him into an actor, and also inflate his ego</p>
<p t="5322460" d="4840">he seemed to do that pretty well, he certainly...</p>
<p t="5327300" d="5300">well, he led a non-violent revolution that resulted in the independence of India</p>
<p t="5332600" d="5740">it also produced a terrible civil war in the separation of the Muslim Indians from the Hindu Indians</p>
<p t="5338340" d="5360">but I don't think you can precisely lay that at the feet of Ghandi</p>
<p t="5343700" d="5260">but what I'm saying is that you have to be an extraordinary person, you have to be extraordinarily wise</p>
<p t="5348960" d="5080">and you have to take ridiculous precautions if you're gonna put yourself in the public sphere like that</p>
<p t="5354040" d="5200">and expose yourself to that kind of adulation without becoming a puppet of the crowd</p>
<p t="5359240" d="4740">and that's what happened to Hitler; I mean it's not like he wasn't also a conscious manipulator</p>
<p t="5363980" d="3960">and surrounded himself by people who were propagandists, and all of that</p>
<p t="5367940" d="6200">so there was a conscious element, but... you gotta think these things through, and see how that dialectic develops</p>
<p t="5374140" d="5940">he learned how to appeal to the darkest fantasies of the crowd, he was really, really good at it</p>
<p t="5380080" d="4520">and that was a dialectic process, right, the crowd told him what they wanted to hear...</p>
<p t="5384600" d="4900">and the crowd's a mob at that point, so I don't have to take responsibility</p>
<p t="5389500" d="4740">for the fact that I'm screaming my approval when I'm surrounded  by a million people</p>
<p t="5394240" d="7140">so I can scream my approval for whatever I want, for whatever dark, revengeful fantasy might be playing out in my imagination</p>
<p t="5401380" d="5440">because I'm not gonna be held accountable for it</p>
<p t="5406820" d="5460">anyways, the cricket's confused, and it's no wonder, it's like the public has rendered its judgment</p>
<p t="5412280" d="7180">and the judgment is positive; so when I wrote the book on which this course is based</p>
<p t="5419460" d="7420">I was thinking: ";how am I gonna judge success?"; and I thought: ";well, there's sort of four... there's a two by two matrix of success";</p>
<p t="5426880" d="6300">you could say: it's a great book, no one reads it; that happens, what do you do about that?</p>
<p t="5433180" d="6040">Nietzsche sold virtually nothing in his life time, and you know that's happened to lots of artists</p>
<p t="5439220" d="4400">then: it's a terrible book, and everyone loves it; that happens too</p>
<p t="5443620" d="4160">and then: it's a great book, and everyone loves it; and then: it's a terrible book, and everyone hates it</p>
<p t="5447780" d="5320">that's probably a better category, actually, than ";it's a terrible book and everyone loves it";</p>
<p t="5453100" d="4340">I mean, you wouldn't pick ";a terrible book that everyone hates"; if you had a choice</p>
<p t="5457440" d="7180">but at least the quality and the response match, at least it's truthful, like: ";great book, good response";</p>
<p t="5464620" d="6480">but the problem with those four categories is you can't really tell which category your production falls into</p>
<p t="5471100" d="3200">because how do you know?</p>
<p t="5474300" d="4440">I think you should assume ";horrible book, bad response,"; because that's the most likely</p>
<p t="5478740" d="7440">of all four of those categories, that's the most likely to be true, purely on actuarial grounds, let's say</p>
<p t="5486180" d="4920">so, all right, so anyways, the cricket wanders away, because he obviously...</p>
<p t="5491100" d="3900">not only was he late for work that day, but he turned out to be wrong about everything</p>
<p t="5495000" d="9280">so he lets Pinokio go off on his adventure; and Stromboli puts him in this little touring wagon</p>
<p t="5504280" d="10080">and away they go; and the cricket thinks: ";well, the consciensce isn't needed anymore on this journey towards unearned celebrity";</p>
<p t="5514360" d="10500">well, meanwhile, back at the ranch, as they say, the puppet is supposed to come home after school</p>
<p t="5524860" d="7400">but he doesn't, he doesn't show up</p>
<p t="5532260" d="7820">and the kitten, and the fish, and Gepetto are all waiting there for him, ready to eat</p>
<p t="5540080" d="6780">but he doesn't show up</p>
<p t="5546860" d="5980">and so Gepetto goes out into the rain to look for him</p>
<p t="5552840" d="8040">and he can't find him; and then we see the inside of the traveling show cart</p>
<p t="5560880" d="6960">and Stromboli is having a snack, and counting all the money that he's made from tonight's performance</p>
<p t="5567840" d="6540">and hypothetically dividing it out with the puppet, so we've got this little stack of gold, and some of it's false</p>
<p t="5574380" d="5300">somebody paid with a... looks like a little washer, mechanical washer, and it's bent</p>
<p t="5579680" d="6280">and so he curses about that for a while, even though, it's interesting, eh, because he's made all this money</p>
<p t="5585960" d="7980">he's been really successful, but this one little error is enough to enrage him, which is very ungrateful and tyrannical</p>
<p t="5593940" d="7680">look, you got a hundred gold pieces, someone's slipped you a fake one</p>
<p t="5601620" d="3800">you could've had 101, it's still a pretty good day, all things considered</p>
<p t="5605420" d="4300">you know, you gotta make a bit of allowance for error, which is something a tyrant does not do</p>
<p t="5609720" d="8700">and that's perfect, because if you don't make allowance for error at all, then people are always guilty of something</p>
<p t="5618420" d="5960">and if you're a tyrant, that's exactly what you want; and people *are* always guilty of something</p>
<p t="5624380" d="5020">so the tyrant who is willing to exploit that is always on solid ground</p>
<p t="5629400" d="6820">anyways, he doesn't share with Pinokio</p>
<p t="5636220" d="5820">and he puts him in a bird cage, a jail, and he also shows him this other puppet that has an axe through him</p>
<p t="5642040" d="6480">that was the previous puppet, who didn't precisely perform as he was supposed to</p>
<p t="5648520" d="5920">so there's a big threat there, it's like: ";you stay in that jail, you do exactly what I want</p>
<p t="5654440" d="5080">or it's off to the wood pile for you, to be burned";</p>
<p t="5659520" d="6900">well, that's just worth thinking about, 'cause that's kind of what happens with tyrants</p>
<p t="5666420" d="4820">and literally, not just metaphorically</p>
<p t="5671240" d="8800">so the cricket is basically wondering what in the world he should do</p>
<p t="5680040" d="4700">and then the cart rolls by, and he gets an inking or hears, I don't quite remember this</p>
<p t="5684740" d="5520">that Pinokio is in there, and might be in trouble, or he thinks that up, I'm sorry, I can't remember that</p>
<p t="5690260" d="4720">but he ends up inside the cart, he finds that traveling cart, and he goes inside</p>
<p t="5694980" d="4380">and then he tries to pick the lock, 'cause he's a bug, he can climb inside</p>
<p t="5699360" d="5660">he tries to pick the lock, he tries to get Pinokio out of the jail that he sort of collaborated himself into</p>
<p t="5705020" d="7020">it's interesting, because if you read, for example, if you read Solzhenitsyn's Gulag Archipelago</p>
<p t="5712040" d="10620">which I would highly recommend, one of the things you find is that if you were arrested by the  KGB</p>
<p t="5722660" d="11320">the secret police in the Soviet Union, and you were hauled off to a... like a tribunal, before a judge</p>
<p t="5733980" d="7380">they wanted you to admit that you were guilty, you had to, they'd torture you until you confessed</p>
<p t="5741360" d="5000">or you could just confess, and I always found that so mysterious</p>
<p t="5746360" d="5940">they kick down your door, they know perfectly well that they haven't got anymore on you than they've got on anyone else</p>
<p t="5752300" d="4960">and yet you have to go through the damn trial, and you have to admit that they're right</p>
<p t="5757260" d="5480">why do they even bother with that? why don't they just throw your sorry ass into the camp?</p>
<p t="5762740" d="4800">which is essentially what's gonna happen anyway; why do they need your collaboration?</p>
<p t="5767540" d="9940">you know, I never quite figured that out, I think it's partly because they're not willing to let you stand in opposition to the rules</p>
<p t="5777480" d="7420">because the mere fact that you'll do that means that you exist as something that is allowed to exist outside the rules</p>
<p t="5784900" d="5340">and they're not having any of that, so that's part of it</p>
<p t="5790240" d="5780">but there's more to it, there's more to it than that, it's like the drama of collaboration</p>
<p t="5796020" d="5260">one of the things I learned about societies like the Soviet Union, and this is true of all tyrannical societies</p>
<p t="5801280" d="6300">is that the idea that that's top-down, and that people are just following orders, they're good people, but they're just following orders</p>
<p t="5807580" d="2920">you can forget about that, that's a stupid theory</p>
<p t="5810500" d="5820">when a society becomes tyrannical like that, the tyranny exists at every single level of the society</p>
<p t="5816320" d="6880">you tyrannize your own conscience; so let's say you're a true believer in Marxist utopia, let's say</p>
<p t="5823200" d="6140">or a national socialist Third Reich, that's gonna last a thousand years and be racially pure, and you really believe that</p>
<p t="5829340" d="4980">and that's supposed to be a perfect state, and that's already been delivered to you</p>
<p t="5834320" d="5740">so what that means is that insofar as you're a true believer, your own suffering becomes heretical</p>
<p t="5840060" d="6200">because to the degree that you're suffering, you're living proof of the fact that the system is not delivering what it promised to deliver</p>
<p t="5846260" d="5540">and so you have to suppress that, you have to become your own tyrant, you can't admit that anything's gone wrong</p>
<p t="5851800" d="4940">and of course you can't talk about it to your family, because one out of three of them are government informers</p>
<p t="5856740" d="4260">just like one out of three of everyone, and you're certainly not going to mention it in the workplace</p>
<p t="5861000" d="4080">because unless you're a devout communist party member, you're not going anywhere</p>
<p t="5865080" d="6200">and if any of your ancestors were land owners or bourgeoisie, you're done, you're done</p>
<p t="5871280" d="2940">class guilt, man, you're not going anywhere</p>
<p t="5874220" d="6020">and then every single level of the bureaucracy is exactly the same as that, and on the top there's a tyrant</p>
<p t="5880240" d="4680">but the tyrant is everywhere, everywhere from the peak to the soul</p>
<p t="5884920" d="5660">it's all tyranny, and everyone participates in that by lying about everything</p>
<p t="5890580" d="3440">and that's why you see what happens next in the movie</p>
<p t="5894020" d="6560">Pinokio's in jail, and he's there because he was naive, and he allowed himself to be enticed</p>
<p t="5900580" d="5740">and because he did something that would've run contrary to his conscience; but the movie does not put up straw men</p>
<p t="5906320" d="6320">the poor damn puppet got tangled into this, his conscience wasn't even around, so you have to have some sympathy for him</p>
<p t="5912640" d="2880">but it doesn't matter, it doesn't matter</p>
<p t="5915520" d="9300">because he ends up in jail and he can't get out, and the fact that in some ways it wasn't his fault</p>
<p t="5924820" d="3780">doesn't change the fact that he's in jail, and he can't get out</p>
<p t="5928600" d="2580">and then his...</p>
<p t="5931180" d="5440">I was watching Louis CK the other night, and he was talking about children lying</p>
<p t="5936620" d="5860">he was talking about his 9-year-old daughter lying, and he said: ";it's no wonder children lie</p>
<p t="5942480" d="5200">no wonder it's impossible for you to stop them</p>
<p t="5947680" d="6040">because you're talking to someone whose head would scrape the roof, they weigh three times as much as you</p>
<p t="5953720" d="6080">and they're capable of force, and they're intimidating; and they say to you something like:</p>
<p t="5959800" d="3860">";did you take that last cookie after I told you not to?";</p>
<p t="5963660" d="4940">and you're thinking: ";oh no, I took the cookie, what am I gonna do?";</p>
<p t="5968600" d="6540">and then you get a genius idea in your head; smarter children learn to lie earlier</p>
<p t="5975140" d="4140">children with high IQs learn to lie younger; and CK says:</p>
<p t="5979280" d="4260">";well, it's like you've just been handed a magic get out of jail free card</p>
<p t="5983540" d="6920">you can just say: ";no, I didn't take that cookie";; and worse than that, it works in every single situation</p>
<p t="5990460" d="4860">if you get away with it; and now you're supposed to learn not to do that</p>
<p t="5995320" d="8900">well, great, that's the thing about comedians, they tell you the underlying truth, which is why people think they're so funny</p>
<p t="6004220" d="5120">like the jester at the king's court, he's the only one who's allowed to tell the king the truth, 'cause he's beneath contempt</p>
<p t="6009340" d="3280">that's what comedians do</p>
<p t="6012620" d="4560">so what happens is Pinokio is not very happy about this, it's really breaking him up</p>
<p t="6017180" d="4040">and the blue fairy appears again from the star, same way</p>
<p t="6021220" d="8780">so what this means is, and I think this is right, this is something Jung talked about, it's also extraordinarily brilliant</p>
<p t="6030000" d="6040">he said that it's one thing to break a rule when you don't really know the rule</p>
<p t="6036040" d="5500">for whatever reason you seem to get a bit of a free pass for that</p>
<p t="6041540" d="6380">but if then you know the rule, and then you break it anyway, you get hit a lot harder</p>
<p t="6047920" d="5860">and I know that's true, and I even think I figured out why it was true at one point, but I can't remember at the moment</p>
<p t="6053780" d="9740">but there's something about... it's like the severity of the moral error isn't quite as massive if you're genuinely ingorant and unconscious about the rule</p>
<p t="6063520" d="5720">and maybe it's because you're not violating your own belief system as much when you engage in the misactivity</p>
<p t="6069240" d="4180">it's something like that</p>
<p t="6073420" d="5020">so Pinokio is in there, and he's partly at fault, at least because he's naive</p>
<p t="6078440" d="7160">and he's very desperate about it; but it's also because his conscience isn't functioning very well</p>
<p t="6085600" d="5920">so he has his reasons, and so whatever, the blue fairy shows up again, mother nature steps in</p>
<p t="6091520" d="7980">to aid him; and that is true, I would say, it's not like you get walloped</p>
<p t="6099500" d="6020">or killed every time you make a mistake, which is kinda interesting</p>
<p t="6105520" d="4620">and especially that's the case with kids, we have more leeway for them</p>
<p t="6110140" d="5380">whether nature does, that's a different issue, but I would say yes, because kids are really cute</p>
<p t="6115520" d="5780">and they're appealing, and they're naive, and they're kind of helpless, they have those motions even</p>
<p t="6121300" d="4820">that indicate helplessness, and that's associated with a natural apprehension of cuteness</p>
<p t="6126120" d="5620">cuteness is basically: big eyes, small nose, symmetrical features, baby-like features</p>
<p t="6131740" d="7200">helpless movements; that elicits sympathy and compassion, and it does it cross-species</p>
<p t="6138940" d="8780">and so does the cry; my roommate when I was in college had a niece who was quite young, about a year and a half old, I think</p>
<p t="6147720" d="7980">and we had a cat, a wild cat, it was a really fighty cat, partly because of me, because I would always play with it</p>
<p t="6155700" d="5000">and I let it fight with me quite a lot, so it was a fighty cat</p>
<p t="6160700" d="6480">that little girl would come over, and you know, maybe she'd cry, and that cat was there right now, trying to figure out what was wrong</p>
<p t="6167180" d="5260">the cat would use its claws on me, but it would never use its claws on the little kid</p>
<p t="6172440" d="5040">and I thought, that's an indication of that cross-species cuteness</p>
<p t="6177480" d="6160">you're all attracted to that, more or less, and the more maternal you are, the more you're attracted to such things</p>
<p t="6183640" d="4500">but you know, you see something on YouTube, and you go ";aww";, and ";that's so cute";</p>
<p t="6188140" d="11080">yeah, it is, it appeals to exactly this concomitation [sic][possibly meant combination] of infantile features</p>
<p t="6199220" d="7360">and it brings out compassion unless you're psychopathic, so it's a good thing</p>
<p t="6206580" d="5800">but it can be manipulated, that's for sure, women actually manipulate it with makeup</p>
<p t="6212380" d="5700">which is quite sneaky, and good of them</p>
<p t="6218080" d="7220">anyways, the Blue Fairy shows up, so that's nature, so what I'm saying is nature will cut kids a break</p>
<p t="6225300" d="6040">if you think of nature in the guise of their mother, for example, but even the biology of other people</p>
<p t="6231340" d="5180">'cause we're wired to accept behavior from children that we wouldn't accept from other people</p>
<p t="6236520" d="6820">so nature will forgive; so she shows up in her heavenly guise, and says:</p>
<p t="6243340" d="6540">";what's going on?"; and Pinokio, again because he's naive, but also because he's not good</p>
<p t="6249880" d="5140">he's not evil either, he's neither or both, depends on how you look at it</p>
<p t="6255020" d="5880">he also has no idea how smart he is, and how smart he isn't, or how smart the person he's talking to is</p>
<p t="6260900" d="6040">and instead of admitting what he's done, he lies about it, and that's interesting</p>
<p t="6266940" d="7060">because it does suggest that he understands at some level that he set himself up for this</p>
<p t="6274000" d="9800">because he could have just told the truth, ";this horrible fox kidnapped me, and sold me to this slave holder";</p>
<p t="6283800" d="6000">which is true, it's a lot more true than the story he tells, he tells a story about some monster</p>
<p t="6289800" d="6340">a fictional monster; he could have told even three quarters of the truth and had it work, but he doesn't</p>
<p t="6296140" d="4980">he just obscures the story entirely; and this is the part of the movie that people remember</p>
<p t="6301120" d="6720">and I edited this out for years when I was talking about this movie, I forgot why it was so significant</p>
<p t="6307840" d="6140">his nose grows, and it grows to ridiculous length</p>
<p t="6313980" d="5520">and why is that?</p>
<p t="6319500" d="4700">I think it was Mark Twain, Samuel Clemens, who said:</p>
<p t="6324200" d="4440">";one of the advantages to telling the truth is that you don't have to remember what you said";</p>
<p t="6328640" d="5420">and that, God, that's worth listening to, because...</p>
<p t="6334060" d="4660">there's a bunch of things that I learned as a clinician</p>
<p t="6338720" d="4540">and one of them is... 'cause you're often in really weird situations if you're a clinician</p>
<p t="6343260" d="3820">'cause things happen that don't happen normally, and you don't know what to do</p>
<p t="6347080" d="4220">so what I've learned is I just say what's happening, whatever it is</p>
<p t="6351300" d="4500">regardless of what it is, I'll just try to describe it as accurately as I can</p>
<p t="6355800" d="3380">and don't worry in some sense about the consequences</p>
<p t="6359180" d="3480">I'm not going to go out of my way to cause trouble, but if you're in a really...</p>
<p t="6362660" d="4920">and I'm telling you, this could save your life at times, especially if you're dealing with someone's who's paranoid</p>
<p t="6367580" d="4300">who's really paranoid; you do not lie to someone who's paranoid and violent</p>
<p t="6371880" d="4680">because as soon as you lie you're aligned with the forces that are persecuting him</p>
<p t="6376560" d="4320">and they're gonna be watching, because paranoia makes people hyper-vigilant, like they're on amphetamines</p>
<p t="6380880" d="3880">in fact, you can make people paranoid by giving them enough amphetamines</p>
<p t="6384760" d="4040">and you can make paranoid people more paranoid by giving them amphetamines</p>
<p t="6388800" d="4620">so they're hyper-vigilant, because they feel that everything is predatory, and against them</p>
<p t="6393420" d="4980">and so they're watching you like you would not believe, way more than you're watching them</p>
<p t="6398400" d="5120">and if you flicker a lie while you're talking to them, and they're really on the edge</p>
<p t="6403520" d="6220">you're done; so it's one thing to know if you're ever in a really bad situation</p>
<p t="6409740" d="7220">and you don't know what to do: you tell the truth, minimally, don't disclose too much, that's just another lie</p>
<p t="6416960" d="4980">you tell the truth minimally and carefully, and hopefully</p>
<p t="6421940" d="3740">and you might get out of it, you might get out of it</p>
<p t="6425680" d="4620">but if you falsify it, look the hell out</p>
<p t="6430300" d="6540">so the truth is a real mechanism of protection in dangerous situations</p>
<p t="6436840" d="4940">if someone's trying to intimidate you, and you think they might be violent, and they ask you if you're afraid</p>
<p t="6441780" d="5760">then you tell them that you're terrified and that you hope things will go okay</p>
<p t="6447540" d="4420">or you say... I'll give you an example</p>
<p t="6451960" d="9700">one time I was in an airport, and we're in this lineup to fly back to Canada that said ";international flights";</p>
<p t="6461660" d="6780">it's a long lineup, like 50 people, I got about 3 [people] from the front, there's still like 40 people behind me</p>
<p t="6468440" d="3840">and the guy behind the counter decided that he was just gonna shut down the line</p>
<p t="6472280" d="6400">and we could all go to this other line, which was like 300 people long, and I suggested that he not do that</p>
<p t="6478680" d="5340">because we'd been standing there for half and hour, and that he could just deal with the 20 of us that were left</p>
<p t="6484020" d="3920">and have a clue; and he called the sheriff, right away</p>
<p t="6487940" d="4400">and this was down in Florida, and it wasn't that long after 9/11</p>
<p t="6492340" d="4980">and so these guys came up, and they were armed, and they came, and looked at me</p>
<p t="6497320" d="5580">because of course he told them that I was causing trouble, which I wasn't, I was just trying to not...</p>
<p t="6502900" d="7600">let, what would you say, an arrogant bureaucratic scumrat [sic] take advantage of me</p>
<p t="6510500" d="5620">which is not the same as causing trouble; as soon as the cops came up, I said: ";look</p>
<p t="6516120" d="5960">I'm going to do exactly what you tell me to do right now, and I'm not gonna cause any trouble</p>
<p t="6522080" d="6100">but I would like you to hear what actually happened,"; that's a good example of a situation like that</p>
<p t="6528180" d="5740">if someone's got you, no bravado, it's a very bad idea</p>
<p t="6533920" d="5960">and I was going to do exactly what they told me, because they didn't know who I was</p>
<p t="6539880" d="3520">and I didn't know what they had been told</p>
<p t="6543400" d="7060">anyhow, the problem with lying is that it's a hydra, and kids find out this very early</p>
<p t="6550460" d="5440">'cause you tell one lie, and what happens is it has one of the consequences you'd expect, maybe you get away with it</p>
<p t="6555900" d="5800">but it has 3 or 4 others that you don't expect, and it's like it grows some complexity</p>
<p t="6561700" d="6280">and then you have to tack a lie on each of those little complexity outcrops, and then they grow three more complexities</p>
<p t="6567980" d="6940">and soon this little lie turns into a great big ball of lies, and at some point it becomes painfully evident to everyone</p>
<p t="6574920" d="5040">and by that time you're in such... you see this with politicians, like that guy who was sexting</p>
<p t="6579960" d="4520">Anthony Weiner, and perfect name for him, man, it's so funny</p>
<p t="6584480" d="3980">I shouldn't make that comment 'cause it's so obvious, but it's still funny</p>
<p t="6588460" d="5840">but that's exactly what happened to him, it wasn't even so much the event</p>
<p t="6594300" d="6180">because people are stupid, they make mistakes, and actually the public is somewhat forgiving</p>
<p t="6600480" d="7200">if you say: ";yeah, geez, I'm a real moron, like really, seriously, how could I do that? but I did</p>
<p t="6607680" d="7160">I'll try not to do it again";; but what happens with politicians is... and I'm not speaking specifically of politicians</p>
<p t="6614840" d="4480">they'll make an error and it gets exposed, and then they'll make three others, trying to cover it up</p>
<p t="6619320" d="4460">it happened with Nixon, for example, and then the whole thing turns into a complete scandal</p>
<p t="6623780" d="5000">and maybe they could've got out of it at the beginning by just telling the truth</p>
<p t="6628780" d="5520">";yes, I'm an idiot, I'll try not to do it again";</p>
<p t="6634300" d="7380">that isn't what happens in this case, and Pinokio grows this elaborate series of lies</p>
<p t="6641680" d="5780">and the fairy is willing to be a little generous to him, because he's little and cute, and he's still a puppet</p>
<p t="6647460" d="4480">and she tells him not to do that</p>
<p t="6651940" d="7440">and that she's gonna give him a pass this time, but that she isn't gonna be able to intervene on his behalf again</p>
<p t="6659380" d="5380">and that's partly... one of the things that's quite interesting about people who have Rousseauian ideas about children</p>
<p t="6664760" d="5640">so: children are all good, and they get corrupted by society, which is half true</p>
<p t="6670400" d="5180">because they're also not good, and they get shaped and disciplined by society</p>
<p t="6675580" d="5420">but the Rousseauian types often are very interesting when their kids hit teenage years</p>
<p t="6681000" d="4760">or when they're judging, say, criminal teenagers</p>
<p t="6685760" d="5980">it's like the child is perfect until they hit like 11, then they turn into a teenager, and the they're like thugs</p>
<p t="6691740" d="5400">so they go from good to thug in one move; and you often see that in families, too</p>
<p t="6697140" d="4820">that have treated especially their daughters like a princess, and then they hit puberty</p>
<p t="6701960" d="5260">and the parents who have princessed them to death have no idea what to do with them</p>
<p t="6707220" d="7260">so then they become demonized, so the overly good child turn into the overly wicket teenager</p>
<p t="6714480" d="8680">and sometimes they'll act that out, too, one of the things I've seen with girls who are held in princess esteem when they're little</p>
<p t="6723160" d="4320">and their parents have to tight [sic] a grip on them, and too much of a demand for good behavior</p>
<p t="6727480" d="7260">is they'll find some nasty character associate with, who will tear them out of the family, bikers are really good for that sort of thing</p>
<p t="6734740" d="7760">and especially if you have some vengeful thoughts towards your parents, a nice biker is your perfect solution to that problem</p>
<p t="6742500" d="10780">okay, we'll go through this scene, and then I think we'll call it a day</p>
<p t="6753280" d="6400">so now Pinokio's gone free, he's been reunited with his conscience, he's learned a couple of lessons</p>
<p t="6759680" d="4900">1. don't be an actor, 2. and don't lie, and those things are quite similar</p>
<p t="6764580" d="6100">and especially once you're caught in your actor trap, don't lie to get out, 'cause that will just make it worse</p>
<p t="6770680" d="5940">so that's the first of his trials, his moral trials on the road to becoming real</p>
<p t="6776620" d="4920">now here we're at a different place, we're at this... I think it's called the Red Lobster Inn</p>
<p t="6781540" d="7280">and it's a shadowy place, kind of cave-like, it's an underground entrance to somewhere that's not good</p>
<p t="6788820" d="6440">and it's a foggy night, and you can't really see, so everything's murky and gloomy there</p>
<p t="6795260" d="7800">inside we see the coachman and the fox and the cat</p>
<p t="6803060" d="6420">and the coachman's a bad guy, he's that mask that we saw first of all</p>
<p t="6809480" d="4860">he's the archetype of that mask that was judgmental about Pinokio having a voice</p>
<p t="6814340" d="7500">one of the things Jung said about the shadow, and this is, I would say, one of the primary impediments to enlightenment</p>
<p t="6821840" d="7680">is that if you start looking at your motives for misbehaving, and I mean by that something very specific</p>
<p t="6829520" d="5000">I don't mean that you're misbehaving by someone else's standards, I don't mean that</p>
<p t="6834520" d="6580">I mean: when you know by your own standards that you're doing something that devious or malevolent or underhanded</p>
<p t="6841100" d="5020">you know it, and you still do it, so it's your own judgment you're bringing to bear on yourself</p>
<p t="6846120" d="6740">if you look at why you're doing that, the longer you look at it, the deeper a hole you dig</p>
<p t="6852860" d="4260">this is the motif of Dante's Inferno, fundamentally</p>
<p t="6857120" d="8820">Dante's Inferno is a story about, I can't remember his name, unfortunately; might be Dante, in fact</p>
<p t="6865940" d="7700">I don't remember; he's led into hell by Virgil, who is an ancient philosopher, thinker [he was a poet]</p>
<p t="6873640" d="9100">and hell has levels, so the outer level is... and this is a christianised version of hell, because there's hells of all sorts</p>
<p t="6882740" d="6840">but this is a christianised version; on the outermost levels of hell, which is sort of like normal life</p>
<p t="6889580" d="4240">are the ancient philosophers, and they're still in hell, because they weren't christian</p>
<p t="6893820" d="6180">but it's like cheap motel hell instead of the full pit thing</p>
<p t="6900000" d="6860">so then Dante goes deeper and deeper into hell, until he gets right to the bottom of it</p>
<p t="6906860" d="6660">it's been a while since I read it, but if I remember correctly, Satan himself is encased in ice at the bottom of hell</p>
<p t="6913520" d="8880">surrounded by people who betray others; so Dante's notion was that worst of all possible violations of  moral behavior</p>
<p t="6922400" d="6000">was betrayal, they're in the deepest levels hell, and I really like that idea, I think it's true</p>
<p t="6928400" d="5780">because if you trust me, then you're manifesting the necessary courage that puts someone through life</p>
<p t="6934180" d="7060">if you're smart, you don't trust me 'cause you're naive, you trust me knowing that I'm full of snakes, and so are you</p>
<p t="6941240" d="3940">but maybe we can cooperate, and move things along nicely</p>
<p t="6945180" d="4900">we can reduce each other to our word, and we can cooperate</p>
<p t="6950080" d="8880">but you're awake, and then I betray that, then I'm undermining your necessary faith in life and humanity</p>
<p t="6958960" d="5000">and you can really hurt someone that way; sometimes it's self-betrayal</p>
<p t="6963960" d="5420">but you can really do someone in, you can really traumatize them, so that they can't recover</p>
<p t="6969380" d="5260">so it's a really terrible thing to do to someone, and maybe it's the worst thing, and that was Dante's idea</p>
<p t="6974640" d="6280">and it's tied in... that makes very interesting reading, if you read it at the same time as Milton's Paradise Lost</p>
<p t="6980920" d="8380">because those metaphysical explorations, this is what they are, they're metaphysical explorations of the terrible places you can end up</p>
<p t="6989300" d="6380">and that people do end up, and also a metaphysical explanation of what spirit takes you there</p>
<p t="6995680" d="6680">'cause you might ask: ";well, why do you betray someone?"; and that is a deep question</p>
<p t="7002360" d="4080">so you'll have your specific reasons, but under that there'll be some other reasons</p>
<p t="7006440" d="3760">and under that there'll be some other reasons, and under that there'll be some other reasons</p>
<p t="7010200" d="4600">and if you all the way to the bottom, you come up with the ultimate reasons why you  betrayed someone</p>
<p t="7014800" d="3140">and when you look at that, that will not be pretty</p>
<p t="7017940" d="5940">that's when your proclivity for evil, let's say, unites with the general human proclivity for evil</p>
<p t="7023880" d="3660">and you discover just exactly what you're capable of</p>
<p t="7027540" d="6560">Jung's notion was that that was a full encounter with the shadow, which is I suppose partly what this course is about</p>
<p t="7034100" d="6060">because one of the things I believe I told you at the beginning was that I was going to try and help you understand</p>
<p t="7040160" d="4520">how it might be that you could be an Auschwitz guard</p>
<p t="7044680" d="4280">and to really understand that, that's a horrifying thing to understand</p>
<p t="7048960" d="5880">but I'll tell you, if you wanna grow some teeth, that's a really good thing to understand</p>
<p t="7054840" d="8420">so we were talking about your capacity to negotiate before, if you aren't a monster, you cannot negotiate</p>
<p t="7063260" d="6440">but if you've got that under control, then you don't have to be a monster</p>
<p t="7069700" d="9000">it's really paradoxical, so if you're just naive, well, you end up in jail, and a marionette master has control over you</p>
<p t="7078700" d="5000">that's not helpful, so that's not good, that just means you're useless, and you can be manipulated</p>
<p t="7083700" d="4320">you won't go out of your way to be malevolent, but it's mostly because you just don't have the skills</p>
<p t="7088020" d="8060">the organizational skills, or even the depth to do that; you're good because you're harmless, that's not good</p>
<p t="7096080" d="4300">that's easily manipulated, so you think, well, how do you get out of that?</p>
<p t="7100380" d="5460">partly, you watch people, because you know what they're like, because you know what you're like</p>
<p t="7105840" d="4600">but you also know what you could do, and would do if you were pushed</p>
<p t="7110440" d="5880">you don't have to show much of that when you're negotiating with someone for them to take you really seriously</p>
<p t="7116320" d="10020">it's a strange thing; but one of the things Jung pointed out, too, was that what you most need to know will be found where you least want to look</p>
<p t="7126340" d="2760">and that's 'cause you haven't already looked there</p>
<p t="7129100" d="6340">it's a little different for everyone, right, 'cause your particular place you don't wanna look isn't gonna be the same as your place</p>
<p t="7135440" d="5480">but you're gonna have a place you don't wanna look, and what you haven't discovered, that's where it is</p>
<p t="7140920" d="6280">that's partly going to be discovered by you looking at what you're capable of, what you're truly capable of</p>
<p t="7147200" d="7420">people, especially on the compassionate end, think: ";I could never be brutal like that";</p>
<p t="7154620" d="6040">and that could be true, but you can kill people with compassion, no problem, that's the Freudian oedipal situation</p>
<p t="7160660" d="5700">so think about working in a nursing home, there's actually a rule of thumb, which I also use</p>
<p t="7166360" d="4580">to guide my interactions with children, and also with my clients, and I would say with people in general</p>
<p t="7170940" d="7340">*do not do anything for anyone that they can't do themselves,* you just steal it from them</p>
<p t="7178280" d="5600">so imagine you're working with really elderly people, they have Alzheimer's, it's really easy to do things for them</p>
<p t="7183880" d="7680">because, well, ";easy";, 'cause it's really a hard job, but it might be easier to do something for them than to let them struggle through it</p>
<p t="7191560" d="5220">but you just speed their demise by taking away the last vestiges of their independence</p>
<p t="7196780" d="5960">you do the same thing with kids, it's like: ";struggle through it, man";; did you ever see ";My Left Foot?";</p>
<p t="7202740" d="7160">that's a great movie, it's about this author whose name escapes me at the moment, brilliant movie</p>
<p t="7209900" d="6880">the person who played the part, Daniel Day-Lewis, I think he won an Academy Award for it</p>
<p t="7216780" d="8140">it's about this author in Ireland, I think he had cerebral palsy, and he could really do was use his left foot</p>
<p t="7224920" d="4400">that was it, the rest of him was pretty spastic and not controllable</p>
<p t="7229320" d="4980">but he was there, he was very intelligent, he was with it, and his dad would not help him</p>
<p t="7234300" d="5180">he had to drag himself um the damn stairs with his left foot, he just would not help him</p>
<p t="7239480" d="5620">and what happened was, he learned how to live, he could function</p>
<p t="7245100" d="5540">the book and the movie is called ";My Left Foot";, and it does a lovely job of laying that out</p>
<p t="7250640" d="7000">but you have to be one hard-hearted son of a bitch to let your son crawl up the stairs with his left foot over and over</p>
<p t="7257640" d="6480">think about that; but what's the alternative? if he would have been... and of course he lays this out in the book</p>
<p t="7264120" d="8660">if he would have been catered to, he would have ended up just like you'd expect someone who was always catered to</p>
<p t="7272780" d="11760">so it's a very nice lesson in the triumph of fostering independence over too casual compassion</p>
<p t="7284540" d="5560">that's what I would say; so you look at the Coachman here, kind of looks like a demented Santa Claus</p>
<p t="7290100" d="6500">doesn't have a beard, but... it's a nice touch on the animators' part, he's even got a pipe and the red suit</p>
<p t="7296600" d="6240">and so he's listening to the fox and the cat brag about how much money they made selling Pinokio to the Puppet Master</p>
<p t="7302840" d="4440">and how evil and terrible they are, they're bragging away, and he's the real thing, eh</p>
<p t="7307280" d="8540">he's the real thing, and he can see through their little petty, narcissistic, grandiose tales of quasi-criminality</p>
<p t="7315820" d="6520">and has nothing but contempt for, and you can see that in his facial expression, it's like he's sitting back a bit, thinking:</p>
<p t="7322340" d="3180">";keep talking, bucko, pretty soon I'm gonna have you right where I want you";</p>
<p t="7325520" d="4500">the fox and the cat are drinking beer and smoking cigarettes, and talking about how evil they are</p>
<p t="7330020" d="8500">and bragging about how they got one over on like a four-year-old; real impressive, guys, real impressive</p>
<p t="7338520" d="8060">and the Coachman is thinking up his own nefarious schemes right now, what he might do with that puppet if he got his hands on him</p>
<p t="7346580" d="5460">so that's when he reveals himself, so what you see... the filmmakers just do it for a second</p>
<p t="7352040" d="6840">and that's an archetypal trip, you've got the fox and the cat, they're sort of petty examples of criminality and evil</p>
<p t="7358880" d="4880">and then you've got the coachman, and he's the real thing, but he's not really showing anybody who he is</p>
<p t="7363760" d="5160">and then in one scene in the bar he lets his guard down, and he lets them see what he's really like</p>
<p t="7368920" d="6600">and so you see this: all teeth and predatory eyes and glee all at the same time</p>
<p t="7375520" d="5360">that's a bad combination, ";I'm going to eat you, and it's going to make me very happy";</p>
<p t="7380880" d="3800">that's insanity, you do not wanna see that look on someone's face</p>
<p t="7384680" d="5220">so that's the look; and the fox is traumatized by that</p>
<p t="7389900" d="6100">he thinks he's a bad guy, and he's not, he's just... he just can't be a good guy</p>
<p t="7396000" d="5200">he hasn't got the talent to be a bad guy; and then he's talking to the coachman and bragging</p>
<p t="7401200" d="7060">and the Coachman's had enough of it, he shows his real face, and it's like that's not good, the Fox gets a real glimpse into hell</p>
<p t="7408260" d="6760">and that just terrifies him; and the other thing the Coachman does is revel his plans</p>
<p t="7415020" d="7080">and his plans are to kidnap Pinokio along with a bunch of other boys, and to take them to this place called Pleasure Island</p>
<p t="7422100" d="8680">and the Fox knows what's going on there, it's the foreshadowing of the next stage of the adventure</p>
<p t="7430780" d="12440">after the Fox and the Cat are terrified, the Coachman, who takes you along with him</p>
<p t="7443220" d="4940">has a little chat with them, and they describe exactly what they're going to do next</p>
<p t="7448160" d="3660">and the Fox and the Cat know perfectly well that they're over their head</p>
<p t="7451820" d="4380">but at this point in their misadventures there's no pulling back</p>
<p t="7456200" d="7320">and I think we'll stop there, even though it's a little early, because that was a lot of material, and this is a really good place to stop</p>
<p t="7463520" d="5620">I'd be happy to take some questions if you guys have some questions</p>
<p t="7469140" d="4940">we could take questions for like 10 minutes, and then we'll call it a day</p>
<p t="7474080" d="4960">and you can ask me a question about anything you want</p>
<p t="7479040" d="6000">[student] this goes back to the beginning of the lecture, but how does morality go from</p>
<p t="7485040" d="5800">[student] who's stronger and who's weaker to what's good and what isn't?</p>
<p t="7490840" d="4360">we'll, I think it depends to some degree on what you mean by stronger</p>
<p t="7495200" d="4240">so physical strength is one element, if you look at mythological heroes...</p>
<p t="7499440" d="8580">imagine that the stories of heroes are fragmented elements of the archetype</p>
<p t="7508020" d="4980">and so one kind of archetypal hero, obviously, is someone who's physically strong</p>
<p t="7513000" d="5040">there's a great movie that you could watch about this, it's called Hitman Hart</p>
<p t="7518040" d="3940">it's one of the best documentaries I've ever seen, and it's about this guy named Brett Hart</p>
<p t="7521980" d="4200">and Brett Hart was for a while the most famous Canadian on the planet</p>
<p t="7526180" d="5560">and he was a World Wide Wrestling Foundation? what do the call it? WWF?</p>
<p t="7531740" d="4720">[WWE - World Wrestling Entertainment] yeah, he was their lead good guy</p>
<p t="7536460" d="7420">... I love the documentary, 'cause when I was a little kid, like 4 or 5, I used to to watch his father, whose name was Stu Hart</p>
<p t="7543880" d="5260">who ran this channel, this wrestling confederation in Alberta</p>
<p t="7549140" d="5060">and Stu Hart had I think 8 boys, and he trained all of then to be pro wrestlers</p>
<p t="7554200" d="5040">and part of the movie is extraordinarily funny, 'cause Stu Hart is in it, and he's really old</p>
<p t="7559240" d="7500">he's like 85, and he's just barely... can you imagine he was like a pro wrestler for 40 years? every joint is broken</p>
<p t="7566740" d="6500">and he's still big, but he's just barely moving, and this kid and another kid come over</p>
<p t="7573240" d="5740">and Stu is telling the story about how he used to take his boys into the basement and toughen them up</p>
<p t="7578980" d="4040">I think Brett called that the journey to pain or something like that</p>
<p t="7583020" d="5720">his father would take all these kids down there and wrestle with them, and push them right to the edge of their pain tolerance, constantly</p>
<p t="7588740" d="6820">and anyways, they grew up tough, there's no doubt about that, and all his daughters married pro wrestlers, too</p>
<p t="7595560" d="3880">and I think he has 7 daughters, so he's quite the character</p>
<p t="7599440" d="4240">anyways, these two kids, they're late adolescents, early adulthood, come over</p>
<p t="7603680" d="5120">and one of them is pretty damn cocky, and he's listening to Stu, and he says something smart</p>
<p t="7608800" d="3200">like ";well, you know, you were pretty tough in the old days, eh?";</p>
<p t="7612000" d="3720">and Stu looks at him and says: ";why don't you come down to the basement with me?";</p>
<p t="7615720" d="6700">and he says: ";look, I don't wanna hurt you, old man";; so the filmmakers follow them into the basement</p>
<p t="7622420" d="7640">and they're kinda standing there, that old guy grabs him in a headlock, he's like a snake, eh?</p>
<p t="7630060" d="4500">he's got him in a headlock so fast, the kid doesn't what to do, and then...</p>
<p t="7634560" d="10380">Stu, he knows how to put a headlock on someone; he's flexing his forearm, which is still not so bad a forearm</p>
<p t="7644940" d="8300">and this guy's face is just... it's like he's stepped in a  bear trap, plus he's absolutely shocked that this old guy got him</p>
<p t="7653240" d="3420">so he's kind of gasping, and Stu says something like:</p>
<p t="7656660" d="5180">";you watch, if I flex this muscle just right, you can see this vein on his forehead start to pop out";</p>
<p t="7661840" d="3860">it's extraordinarily funny
[Peterson misremembered the scene in some key points, watch it for yourself]</p>
<p t="7665700" d="3560">anyways, Brett Hart plays out the good guy archetype, and Brett's...</p>
<p t="7669260" d="5920">he's a solid guy, but I would say he's not particularly sophisticated, and I'm not being cruel about that</p>
<p t="7675180" d="3060">I mean he had a great career, and he's tough as a boot, so good for him</p>
<p t="7678240" d="5760">but he plays out this good guy archetype and he gets tangled up in it</p>
<p t="7684000" d="5400">now, I don't remember your damn question, but I am trying to answer it, tell me the question again</p>
<p t="7689400" d="6660">[student] so I was wondering how in morality you go from to who's strongest and who's weakest to what's good and what's bad</p>
<p t="7696060" d="6380">oh yes, exactly; one of the things I really liked about this movie was it showed me why people watch wrestling</p>
<p t="7702440" d="3760">and I couldn't... because certainly they're not appealing...</p>
<p t="7706200" d="9580">and I'm not being... there are different strata of conception of abstraction that any entertainment process has to appeal to</p>
<p t="7715780" d="9800">and most people don't go to movies, and that actually... it really is because movies operate at a level of sophistication that is too high for many people</p>
<p t="7725580" d="10220">just like novels, hardly anyone reads; 15% of the population, might be 20%, cannot read well enough to follow written instructions</p>
<p t="7735800" d="8300">and there are people, maybe it's 15% of the population or 10%, who have never finished a book, never</p>
<p t="7744100" d="8580">and it is that high; but the archetype still needs to manifest itself on different levels</p>
<p t="7752680" d="5880">and so it manifests itself in wrestling; but even there, where it is physical force, it's not just physical force</p>
<p t="7758560" d="5780">it's a drama between good and evil, and you can see this so clearly in the Brett Hart documentary</p>
<p t="7764340" d="5260">'cause he's the good guy; the bad guys are really over-the-top bad, it's a real drama</p>
<p t="7769600" d="5640">it's good versus evil in the ring every time, and hopefully good wins, but good often gets...</p>
<p t="7775240" d="5840">maybe the bad wrestler brings two of his friends in, and they bring in chairs, and they bash the hell out of the good guy</p>
<p t="7781080" d="6280">and the whole audience is just outraged by this, and the documentary does a lovely job of showing that</p>
<p t="7787360" d="7000">so even at the level of physical combat, let's say, you can't reduce what's good to what's strong</p>
<p t="7794360" d="3880">it's just one element of it; better to be strong than to be weak</p>
<p t="7798240" d="4480">and so you can have strong hero, because it's better to be strong than to be weak</p>
<p t="7802720" d="3600">but it's better to be strong and kind than to be strong</p>
<p t="7806320" d="3860">and it's better to be strong and kind and wise than to be strong and kind</p>
<p t="7810180" d="7240">and that's true not only in human beings, but it's even true, let's say, at the wolf or chimpanzee level</p>
<p t="7817420" d="5180">because one of the things you see with the chimp dominance hierarchies, and I think I mentioned this before</p>
<p t="7822600" d="8200">is if the leader, the dominant male, is really good at fostering social relations and being reciprocal in acts like grooming</p>
<p t="7830800" d="5940">and also paying attention to the females and their offspring, his dynasty will be much more stable</p>
<p t="7836740" d="8200">and so, strong might be good for one battle, it might be good for two battles, but for 50 battles it's not optimized</p>
<p t="7844940" d="4800">especially because no matter how strong you are, someone can take you out</p>
<p t="7849740" d="8440">so what happens is the idea of what's ideal becomes increasingly complex across time, multifaceted</p>
<p t="7858180" d="6980">and so: strength, wisdom, intelligence, vision, all these things are amalgamated into a single being</p>
<p t="7865160" d="4460">and we'll talk a lot about that, because I wanna show you how that happened in Mesopotamia</p>
<p t="7869620" d="4240">because that's one of the first places where we have documentation about how that ideal emerged</p>
<p t="7873860" d="3580">they had a god called Marduk, and Marduk had 50 names</p>
<p t="7877440" d="7180">and as far as I can tell, the reason for that was that Marduk was an amalgam of the tribal deities of at least 50 tribes</p>
<p t="7884620" d="6460">and when the tribes were brought together, and civilized, each of their gods, who were ideals-</p>
<p t="7891080" d="7280">had to be amalgamated into something that was a single dramatized representation of value</p>
<p t="7898360" d="3340">or there was no way that all those people could have lived together</p>
<p t="7901700" d="5060">their different value structures would have fragmented them, and they would have stayed in a state of war</p>
<p t="7906760" d="5180">so the question is... it's the question you're asking: if it's not strength, then what is it?</p>
<p t="7911940" d="8040">well, strength is an element, but the Egyptians figured out that it was vision, it was actually the capacity to pay attention</p>
<p t="7919980" d="4080">that was paramount, and the Mesopotamians had that figured out more or less too</p>
<p t="7924060" d="4340">because their god Marduk had eyes all the way around his head, he could see everywhere</p>
<p t="7928400" d="7100">so seeing was a critical element of what should be on top, and the other thing for the Mesopotamians was the ability to speak</p>
<p t="7935500" d="5020">so by the time of Mesopotamia people had already dramatized the idea</p>
<p t="7940520" d="4400">that cardinal human attributes are vision and the ability to speak</p>
<p t="7944920" d="4860">and the ability to speak the truth, too, not just speak</p>
<p t="7949780" d="3020">other questions?</p>
<p t="7952800" d="8120">[student] so, I wasn't really aware of what you just said that most people don't watch movies</p>
<p t="7960920" d="8660">[student] because I've probably watched [unintelligible] so is that why we sort of consider... 'cause we were talking about celebrity career</p>
<p t="7969580" d="11820">[student] that different levels of abstraction of celebrity are respected more? like reality TV probably lower than ... Cumberbatch, than like a theater actor, then like a novelist</p>
<p t="7981400" d="4840">[Peterson] sure, yes, that's exactly why, because, you see</p>
<p t="7986240" d="10200">the less sophisticated the genre, the more the genre is like real life</p>
<p t="7996440" d="9600">and the more sophisticated it is, the more it has abstracted out across instances of real life the fundamental lessons</p>
<p t="8006040" d="5580">and that's what makes something profound and deep, it's abstracted from multiple sources</p>
<p t="8011620" d="5580">and it applies across multiple dimensions; 'cause that's what you want, and here is why</p>
<p t="8017200" d="9260">fundamentally, you have a problem, but that's not the problem, the problem is that there are problems</p>
<p t="8026460" d="4280">so the problem is a metaproblem: there are problems</p>
<p t="8030740" d="7300">you need a solution to that, that's not a solution to a problem, that's a metasolution to the class of problems</p>
<p t="8038040" d="6320">right, and that's what people have been trying to figure out ever since we were able to actually figure things out</p>
<p t="8044360" d="6400">it's not: ";how do you solve a problem";, it's: ";how do you act so that you solve the problem of problems";</p>
<p t="8050760" d="5560">and that's basically the complexity of life and the fact that you're mortal and vulnerable</p>
<p t="8056320" d="5780">[student] so then a follow-up question, from your book you have this sort of strata</p>
<p t="8062100" d="7560">from play all the way up to religion and beyond that, sort of looking back retroactively with philosophy and rationality</p>
<p t="8069660" d="7760">[muted]</p>
<p t="8077420" d="6160">well that's a  good one, because I would say [muted]</p>
<p t="8083580" d="4940">if you really wanna think this through, the best way to do that is to read Nietzsche and Dostoevsky at the same time</p>
<p t="8088520" d="5100">now, I'm sure there's other ways of doing this; but Nietzsche was actually quite heavily influenced by Dostoevsky</p>
<p t="8093620" d="4280">more than people knew, although their thought runs very parallel</p>
<p t="8097900" d="7140">Dostoevsky is like the ultimate dramatist, he embodies his ideas, and he has them act out in a dramatic space</p>
<p t="8105040" d="5400">it's literary; whereas Nietzsche has taken that up one level of abstraction, to the semantic</p>
<p t="8110440" d="5120">he says: ";well, here's what's going on"; in an articulated way, but he doesn't embody it in a story</p>
<p t="8115560" d="3560">and you might say: ";well, that's higher";, but it's only higher in a way</p>
<p t="8119120" d="4320">it's more abstract in that it's more like words</p>
<p t="8123440" d="3800">whereas what Dostoevsky does is half words and half images</p>
<p t="8127240" d="7400">because when you read a novel what happens is that... people say,  postmodernists say: ";where the hell is the meaning in that novel?";</p>
<p t="8134640" d="6280">it's not in the word, it's not in the phrase, it's not in the sentence, it's not in the paragraph, where do you localize the meaning?</p>
<p t="8140920" d="4340">great question, their answer sucks, bu the question's great</p>
<p t="8145260" d="9740">but what happens partly when you're reading a book, a novel, is that the words trigger representations in your imagination</p>
<p t="8155000" d="9660">a lot of what you extract the information from is actually your imagistic representation of the words</p>
<p t="8164660" d="7680">and that imagistic representation is richer than the words, because it's informed by all of your knowledge about people</p>
<p t="8172340" d="6180">you know this happens, because you go to a movie, like the Harry Potter movies, and you say: ";that's not how I imagined it";</p>
<p t="8178520" d="5720">the probability that there'll be a 1:1 correspondence between your internal representation of the book</p>
<p t="8184240" d="4380">and the movie is 0; and usually the movie is less rich than the book</p>
<p t="8188620" d="4880">I love movies, and they have their own place, that's for sure, but...</p>
<p t="8193500" d="6000">well, miniseries, the series now are more approaching the complexity and depth of literature</p>
<p t="8199500" d="9560">because they can extend across 20 hours, they don't have to compress a 12-hour reading experience into 2 hours of  action</p>
<p t="8209060" d="5240">what I was trying to do with that hierarchy was to show how the knowledge moved</p>
<p t="8214300" d="6900">first of all it's kind of implicit in your biology, and then it's distributed into society</p>
<p t="8221200" d="5620">and then by imitating society you make it part of your procedures, and then you watch your own procedures</p>
<p t="8226820" d="4640">and start to build a representation of them, and then you can articulate that representation</p>
<p t="8231460" d="7860">and it's a bootstrapping process, too, because once you've made the representation, that can affect the way you behave</p>
<p t="8239320" d="11760">so they start to loop; so here's one idea, imagine that there's a type of male who tends to win dominance hierarchy contests</p>
<p t="8251080" d="5720">and to emerge at the top, well that's the case, and that's why you're the way you are</p>
<p t="8256800" d="3280">so what's happened among human beings, this is so cool</p>
<p t="8260080" d="8220">is that human females are choosy maters, so about twice as many men fail in their reproductive efforts as females fail</p>
<p t="8268300" d="6120">but the men who succeed are more successful; so women are on average more successful</p>
<p t="8274420" d="3700">and men are on average more failures and more successful</p>
<p t="8278120" d="5400">and I'm talking strictly about reproduction here, although it generalizes to other areas, but I'm talking about reproduction</p>
<p t="8283520" d="6840">so how does it work, exactly? well, the women have a real problem with mate selection</p>
<p t="8290360" d="6420">who the hell are you gonna have as a mate? it's too complex to work out, so women in their genius don't</p>
<p t="8296780" d="2660">they let the men compete, and then they peel from the top</p>
<p t="8299440" d="5760">acting out the assumption that the man who wins is the best man, and it's a good assumption</p>
<p t="8305200" d="5180">because if you have a bunch of men competing, especially if they're competing across competitions</p>
<p t="8310380" d="4220">and someone pops up at the top, you can think: ";well, they may not be worth much,</p>
<p t="8314600" d="3100">but they're better than anyone else at whatever it is  that they're doing";</p>
<p t="8317700" d="3420">and that makes men at the top of dominance hierarchies very attractive to women</p>
<p t="8321120" d="5160">an then the women accelerate that, so you can imagine they're more likely to reproduce</p>
<p t="8326280" d="5820">so what happens is the proclivity to emerge at the top of the set of dominance hierarchies</p>
<p t="8332100" d="7720">becomes inbuilt into the biology across time, and the women exaggerate that by differentially allowing the men to reproduce</p>
<p t="8339820" d="6420">and that's also why they're mother nature, they really are mother nature, it's not just a metaphor</p>
<p t="8346240" d="5040">then the representation and the biology start to tangle together</p>
<p t="8351280" d="8020">and that's like, well, that's the difference between a meme and an archetype, a meme is this idea that propagates itself</p>
<p t="8359300" d="9000">but an archetype is an idea that has propagated itself across such a massivespan of time that it's actually shaped the course of evolution itself</p>
<p t="8368300" d="8140">and men, I can tell you already... it isn't necessarily that you even have to compete with other men</p>
<p t="8376440" d="8020">in order to see who wins; as soon as you admire someone, and that'll happen unconsciously, you won't be able to stop yourself</p>
<p t="8384460" d="6740">you've already elevated them in the dominance hierarchy contest, the act of admiration is your recognition</p>
<p t="8391200" d="6980">that you've met someone who's better at whatever it is that happens to be driving your admiration than you are</p>
<p t="8398180" d="9980">and that's partly the manifestation of just the idea as the, what would you say, as the representation of the ideal</p>
<p t="8408160" d="6500">kids do that all the time, they hero worship other kids, usually like a 4-year old will latch on to a 6-year old</p>
<p t="8414660" d="5640">who he or she will just follow everywhere, and do exactly what they do</p>
<p t="8420300" d="10640">why? because that person represents to that child their next ideal, their conceptualization of the place forward</p>
<p t="8430940" d="7300">any other questions? or should we maybe call it a day?</p>
<p t="8438240" d="7840">[student] you said when the guy was smiling the thing was predatory glee</p>
<p t="8446080" d="4320">[student] which is insanity, how do you define insanity in this context?</p>
<p t="8450400" d="6160">well, let's call it what you don't wanna encounter alone in an alley at midnight</p>
<p t="8456560" d="6620">and leave it at that, that is what I mean in this context, that's exactly what I mean</p>
<p t="8463180" d="4300">and then not only is the person there waiting for you, but they're looking forward to whatever might happen</p>
<p t="8467480" d="5420">[student] sure, I just mean in a psychological context, using that word has all kind of connotations</p>
<p t="8472900" d="3020">[student] I was making sure I wasn't interpreting it in a wrong way</p>
<p t="8475920" d="4820">no, well the movie provides the frame for the interpretation in this particular situation</p>
<p t="8480740" d="7980">so he's the thing that hauls naive young boys off to their doom; OK, so that's bounded</p>
<p t="8488720" d="14120">yes [student] could you elaborate on... you mentioned the process where people do the thing that's less hard but still hard?</p>
<p t="8502840" d="7860">[student] facing the shadow [peterson] that's actually a really productive way of procrastinating, although it comes with its own problems of rationalization</p>
<p t="8510700" d="11840">[student] that reinforces certain circuits ... [inaudible] bring up inhibitory circuits, and I was wondering if you can elaborate</p>
<p t="8522540" d="15120">well, I've derived that partly from my study of addiction and also from my study of recovery from post-traumatic stress disorder</p>
<p t="8537660" d="9040">but let's talk about addiction, so there's a series of actions that occur before you take your cocaine</p>
<p t="8546700" d="5000">some of those are local, they are the things that happen immediately before, and some of those are distal</p>
<p t="8551700" d="6920">they're farther back in the chain of events; and when you have a hit of cocaine, it produces a dopaminergic burst</p>
<p t="8558620" d="6100">and that feels really good, but it also makes the circuits that were immediately active before that grow</p>
<p t="8564720" d="5600">that's what reinforcement is, and then the growth is proportionate, not linearly</p>
<p t="8570320" d="7620">but it's proportionate to how long before that event occurred, the closer it is, the stronger they're gonna get</p>
<p t="8577940" d="3200">but even the ones that are somewhat distal get some reinforcement</p>
<p t="8581140" d="5700">because you might say: ";well, what did you do before you found your latest fix?";</p>
<p t="8586840" d="4800">and the answer is: ";how long before?";; well, the closer, the more reward</p>
<p t="8591640" d="5840">what happens then is that if you take that person out of the normal environment and you put them into a treatment center</p>
<p t="8597480" d="7200">they're off they're physical addiction, which is a weird thing in the case of cocaine, but...</p>
<p t="8604680" d="6340">like not that long, a week will do it, two weeks for sure, even heroin, and alcohol for sure</p>
<p t="8611020" d="8100">if you can get them through the seizure part without dying; and so they're done, they're not physiologically dependent anymore</p>
<p t="8619120" d="7720">but you let that person go, and the first thing that happens is his old friend who is always doing drugs with shows up</p>
<p t="8626840" d="6320">and bang! he's craving like mad, and that's because that thing in there is not dead at all</p>
<p t="8633160" d="6560">and it's activated by the cue, and it's a circuit... it's not, it's a personality</p>
<p t="8639720" d="6100">it only wants one thing, it wants cocaine, it's gonna suppress any non-related thoughts</p>
<p t="8645820" d="5940">and it'll use lies, that's no problem, especially if lies have been reinforced, which they certainly have</p>
<p t="8651760" d="5880">";where are you off to, son?"; you know, you'll have a lie for that, and then 10 minutes later you have your drug</p>
<p t="8657640" d="5480">that little lie has just  grown; or maybe you think... you try to quit, you think: ";to hell with it!";</p>
<p t="8663120" d="6380">and every time, 10 minutes before you take your drug, you think ";to hell with it";, and you do that a 1000 times</p>
<p t="8669500" d="6780">well, believe me, that ";to hell with it"; circuit, that sucker is strong, it's alive</p>
<p t="8676280" d="5220">and it's not like it just disappears, it can't, it's you, it's grown in there</p>
<p t="8681500" d="7700">now, you can build another circuit to shut it down, and you can help it decompose across time by not giving it what it wants</p>
<p t="8689200" d="6580">but you're gonna have to not give it what it wants in all of the multiple contexts that you've already associated with the drug</p>
<p t="8695780" d="3920">some of you have probably smoked, and then tried to quit smoking, and what you see is</p>
<p t="8699700" d="5940">you get a craving when you have a cup of coffee or when you finish dinner, when you're done having a phone call</p>
<p t="8705640" d="6720">when you first get up in the morning, or whenever you regularly had the drug, whatever you had the drug in relationship to</p>
<p t="8712360" d="4520">even complex things, like ending a conversation will produce a cue of craving</p>
<p t="8716880" d="7600">then that can extinguish over time if you punish it by either punishing it or not letting it get what it wants</p>
<p t="8724480" d="3140">but a lot you have to build another circuit to just shut it down</p>
<p t="8727620" d="3940">and then that circuit's kinda  fragile and stress can often disrupt it</p>
<p t="8731560" d="6380">[student] that can be mediated by [?] people read about quitting smoking or things like ibogaine</p>
<p t="8737940" d="5840">oh sure, well, ibogaine's a whole different thing, because it seems to have a direct physiological effect</p>
<p t="8743780" d="6900">but the addiction has a cognitive component, it's full of thoughts and desires and wants</p>
<p t="8750680" d="7100">you know, you may have to rebuild your whole personality in order to get that thing cornered</p>
<p t="8757780" d="4420">religious conversion, for example, is a really effective treatment for alcoholism</p>
<p t="8762200" d="5200">that's partly why alcoholics anonymous works for the people for whom it does work</p>
<p t="8767400" d="8000">but religious conversion, which is total personality conversion, is actually one of the few things that we know of that's an effective treatment for alcoholism</p>
<p t="8775400" d="4420">we don't know how to induce it, although that's not exactly true either</p>
<p t="8779820" d="8080">because the early work with LSD... LSD was quite promising as a treatment for alcohol addiction</p>
<p t="8787900" d="8060">and there's recent work with psylocybin showing that if people have a mystical experience when given psylocybin</p>
<p t="8795960" d="3200">their success rate of quitting smoking is about 80%</p>
<p t="8799160" d="4080">which is way higher than any pharmacological intervention for smoking has ever been</p>
<p t="8803240" d="6980">alright, we should probably call it a day, we'll see you in a week</p>
