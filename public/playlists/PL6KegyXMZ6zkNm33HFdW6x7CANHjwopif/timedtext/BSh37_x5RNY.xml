<p t="2889" d="15511">Okay, so we're going to wrap up Freud today.
So Freud occupies a strange position in the</p>
<p t="18400" d="6139">history of psychology, because Freud wasn't
a psychologist, he was a medical doctor. And</p>
<p t="24539" d="6330">many of the people whose theories we're
discussing were clinicians, were MDs, not</p>
<p t="30869" d="5901">psychologists. Well of course when Freud was
around, at least when he was training, psychology</p>
<p t="36770" d="5129">hadn't yet become an independent science.
Now the same was true of Jung, and part of</p>
<p t="41899" d="4890">the consequence of that was that when the
new science of psychology developed into what</p>
<p t="46789" d="5371">you're studying today, the psychoanalysts
and the medical community basically stayed</p>
<p t="52160" d="6559">outside of that. And there's never really
been a meeting of the minds between experimental</p>
<p t="58719" d="7231">psychologists and psychoanalysts. Although,
by the 1980s, the cognitive psychologists</p>
<p t="65950" d="5730">were promoting their discovery of the cognitive
unconscious, which always felt to me a little</p>
<p t="71680" d="6321">bit ungrateful, given that Freud had actually
laid the groundwork for the theory of the</p>
<p t="78001" d="5609">unconscious and elaborated that in quite great
detail, you know, almost a hundred years before.</p>
<p t="83610" d="7070">There's some resistance (and that's what
a psychoanalyst would say) among the experimental</p>
<p t="90680" d="5240">psychology community to credit Freud with
any of his real discoveries, and I think that's</p>
<p t="95920" d="7090">very unfortunate, partly because a) he did
make the discoveries, and b) the psychoanalysts</p>
<p t="103010" d="5210">still understand more about the nature of
the unconscious than modern experimental psychologists.</p>
<p t="108220" d="6060">Because modern experimental psychologists
insist on viewing the brain as a cognitive</p>
<p t="114280" d="6240">process, or something like a computer, and
that isn't what it is. It's a living system</p>
<p t="120520" d="6870">composed of other living subsystems. And that
means that, as we've discussed already,</p>
<p t="127390" d="7040">the human psyche and its subordinate components
are better conceived of as personalities and</p>
<p t="134430" d="6870">sub-personalities than in any other manner,
than in systems or than in information processing</p>
<p t="141300" d="6909">machines.
It's… I think perhaps the most fundamental</p>
<p t="148209" d="5801">accomplishment of psychoanalysis, following
Nietzsche, actually, to view the human mind,</p>
<p t="154010" d="10380">the human psyche, as a place of relatively
integrated sub-personalities. I mean, even</p>
<p t="164390" d="3830">when modern people talk about themselves,
they talk about the ‘I' (which would roughly</p>
<p t="168220" d="6189">be the ego, in Freudian terms), they tend
to think of themselves as a unitary phenomenon.</p>
<p t="174409" d="7031">But the problem with that notion is that people
continually do things… they find themselves</p>
<p t="181440" d="3930">doing things that in principle they don't
want to do, or things that they're ashamed</p>
<p t="185370" d="4590">of, or lying when they don't want to lie,
or generally misbehaving. And it's also,</p>
<p t="189960" d="5339">of course, everybody's observation that
you can try to tell yourself what to do, but</p>
<p t="195299" d="4500">that doesn't work very well. So you know,
you've experienced this, undoubtedly in</p>
<p t="199799" d="3601">your own life many, many times, when you're
sitting down and you're trying to study</p>
<p t="203400" d="5669">for something, particularly if you're not
very interested in it, then all sorts of alternative</p>
<p t="209069" d="6521">possibilities will make themselves manifest
in the theater of your imagination. And in</p>
<p t="215590" d="9060">a sense what's happening in those situations
is that parts of you that are organised around</p>
<p t="224650" d="7699">other goals or, from the Freudian perspective,
say, driven by other desires, are trying to</p>
<p t="232349" d="8541">hijack control of your motor output. And that
frequently happens, so that you find yourself,</p>
<p t="240890" d="8200">for example, procrastinating, or rationalising,
or displacing (those are all Freudian concepts).</p>
<p t="249090" d="4050">A displacement would be, instead of doing
the work you're supposed to do you go off</p>
<p t="253140" d="5960">and do some other work. You know, it's not
a bad way of procrastinating, but it's not</p>
<p t="259100" d="4000">great, because you're not focusing on what
you should be focusing on. And so, in some</p>
<p t="263100" d="5820">sense, you're at war with yourself. And
the major player in the war, at least in principle,</p>
<p t="268920" d="4820">is the ego, and that would be equivalent to
Freud's conscious mind, at least in the</p>
<p t="273740" d="3360">initial stages of his theory.
It's somewhat complicated to talk about</p>
<p t="277100" d="5500">Freud because of course his theory developed
across time, and in the beginning, he basically</p>
<p t="282600" d="3850">broke the mind up into the conscious mind
and the unconscious mind. And you can think</p>
<p t="286450" d="4650">of the conscious mind, well that's you,
essentially, that's the you that you can</p>
<p t="291100" d="5340">refer to during day to day experience. And
then the unconscious mind is a storehouse</p>
<p t="296440" d="10870">of two broad classes of phenomena. And one
would be drives that are grounded in instinct,</p>
<p t="307310" d="9170">that are either at odds with your current
goal, or memories, often traumatic, that you</p>
<p t="316480" d="8160">haven't been able to integrate into your
conscious framework. And so those pesky things</p>
<p t="324640" d="5350">take on their own life.
You know if you take an animal and you take</p>
<p t="329990" d="6790">out increasingly large segments of its cortex,
say, the animal still organises itself into</p>
<p t="336780" d="4840">that animal. Like it starts to lose function,
especially if you go deep into the brain (and</p>
<p t="341620" d="4150">you can kill an animal if you go deep into
the brain), but if you stay on the cortical</p>
<p t="345770" d="4780">surface, you can take an awful lot of brain
tissue out without interfering with a lot</p>
<p t="350550" d="5320">of the animal's ability to sustain itself.
And what that shows is that the brain is organised</p>
<p t="355870" d="5730">in such a way so that isolated components
of it will take on a function of the entire</p>
<p t="361600" d="6930">personality. And that's demonstration, in
some sense, that the sub-elements of the psyche,</p>
<p t="368530" d="6650">or perhaps sub-systems of the brain, can organise
themselves into functional living units. And</p>
<p t="375180" d="4040">it stands to reason. I mean, if you lose an
arm you don't stop functioning. You just</p>
<p t="379220" d="6830">reorganise your personality minus the arm.
And if you have only managed to integrate</p>
<p t="386050" d="6700">a certain subset of the potential psychic
manifestations of your mind, then that subset</p>
<p t="392750" d="3670">is going to formulate the main personality,
but all the other things you're ignoring</p>
<p t="396420" d="5310">or can't integrate, they're going to have
a life of their own. They don't just disappear.</p>
<p t="401730" d="7540">And so, Freud offers the unsettling idea that
you're by no means master in your own house.</p>
<p t="409270" d="3790">And one of the ways you can determine that
is by watching yourself do things that you</p>
<p t="413060" d="5300">don't want to do. And those are things,
for example, that you'd have a hard time</p>
<p t="418360" d="4420">facing up to, because of course most of the
things that you don't want to do are things</p>
<p t="422780" d="4180">that you might be ashamed of or anxious about.
And then of course there's the defeat that</p>
<p t="426960" d="5450">you suffer when your ego is hypothetically
in control of the circumstance and you find</p>
<p t="432410" d="6651">your behaviour or your thoughts directed in
some direction under the control of something</p>
<p t="439061" d="4569">that you think that you've mastered.
You can really see this in conditions like</p>
<p t="443630" d="5680">anorexia. Especially if it's accompanied
by bulimia, which it often is. So anorexia</p>
<p t="449310" d="5570">is an eating disorder that causes people,
I think essentially, to become extremely disgusted</p>
<p t="454880" d="5390">with their own physiology, with their own
physical being. And it warps their perceptions</p>
<p t="460270" d="9860">terribly. So I had an anorexic client at one
point, and she was a rather small woman, maybe</p>
<p t="470130" d="5360">5'2” or something like that. Quite thin,
obviously, she had anorexia. And I asked her</p>
<p t="475490" d="5470">when she was in my office if her thigh was
bigger or smaller than mine. And she said</p>
<p t="480960" d="6030">well it was about the same size. So I took
a piece of paper and I sat on it and I drew</p>
<p t="486990" d="5280">the outline of my thigh on it, and then I
had her sit on the same piece of paper and</p>
<p t="492270" d="4100">she drew the outline of her thigh. And of
course, there was probably that much space</p>
<p t="496370" d="4990">on both sides between the two outlines. Well
she probably looked at that for fifteen minutes.</p>
<p t="501360" d="4780">You know, she could not believe that that
could possibly be the case.</p>
<p t="506140" d="5210">And I think what happens in anorexics is that
they stop being able to look at their whole</p>
<p t="511350" d="6730">bodies. So when you look at yourself in the
mirror, you kind of have to look in a Gestalt</p>
<p t="518080" d="5480">manner, you have to get a picture of the whole.
Alternatively you can focus on small parts,</p>
<p t="523560" d="4130">but the more you focus on parts, the more
difficult it is to see the parts in relationship</p>
<p t="527690" d="6770">to the whole. And anorexics get unbelievably
focused on small elements, and they confuse</p>
<p t="534460" d="5690">themselves. So for example, if they're looking
at their arms and there's some flesh on</p>
<p t="540150" d="5930">it, they are unable to make a distinction
between flesh and fat, and they want no fat,</p>
<p t="546080" d="4820">they want to go right down to the bone. And
they can't… because they're concerned</p>
<p t="550900" d="4160">about that tiny little part or maybe this
tiny little part, or wherever they happen</p>
<p t="555060" d="5071">to be focusing, they get completely unable
to perceive their own bodies. And it's quite</p>
<p t="560131" d="7239">striking how far that can go.
And then the bulimic end of it is, well, the</p>
<p t="567370" d="5330">person will starve themselves for a long period
of time, and of course, we'll think about</p>
<p t="572700" d="5400">this in modern physiological terms, feeding
behaviour is regulated by the hypothalamus,</p>
<p t="578100" d="5250">and that's an ancient brain region that
controls fundamental biological systems. And</p>
<p t="583350" d="4390">it's right above the spinal cord and it's
a very, very, very powerful centre of control</p>
<p t="587740" d="3890">in the brain. It's functional enough, and
I think I told you this before, that if you</p>
<p t="591630" d="5300">take a cat and you cut off its entire cortex,
and even most of its emotional systems, if</p>
<p t="596930" d="4470">you leave it just with the hypothalamus and
spinal cord, which means it almost has no</p>
<p t="601400" d="3670">brain, it can organise its behaviour almost
perfectly, as long as you keep it in a simple</p>
<p t="605070" d="5000">environment.
So anyways, the anorexic attempts to starve</p>
<p t="610070" d="7820">but… so that's a conscious goal, you might
say, or an ego-related goal, or you could</p>
<p t="617890" d="5290">even think about it as a goal that's motivated
by other unconscious forces, because she doesn't</p>
<p t="623180" d="7010">know why she wants to starve, but in any case,
what generally happens is, she'll run into</p>
<p t="630190" d="8610">an emotionally upsetting situation. Now emotional
upset, it makes you anxious, or puts you in</p>
<p t="638800" d="4060">emotional pain. That activates higher brain
centres than the hypothalamus, but they're</p>
<p t="642860" d="4360">still pretty low, they're still pretty primordial.
And one of the things that kind of emotional</p>
<p t="647220" d="5641">upset does (let's call it stress) is shut
off your long-term planning. And the reason</p>
<p t="652861" d="6489">for that is that if you're stressed in the
immediate now, your body and brain presume</p>
<p t="659350" d="5740">that you should devote… divert resources
from the hypothetical future to solving the</p>
<p t="665090" d="4200">problem that's right in front of you, and
that's often a more behaviourally oriented</p>
<p t="669290" d="4560">solution, like freezing or withdrawing, or
something like that. So it shuts off your</p>
<p t="673850" d="4720">pre-frontal cortex.
Well as soon as that happens, then the hypothalamus,</p>
<p t="678570" d="5070">which is, as I said, a very powerful system,
just reaches up in some sense and dominates</p>
<p t="683640" d="4460">the person. I mean, it's been there for
God only knows how long, you know, tens of</p>
<p t="688100" d="5250">millions of years, and its job is to stop
you from starving to death. And you know,</p>
<p t="693350" d="5710">you can imagine that over the course of evolutionary
history anybody who had a relatively weak</p>
<p t="699060" d="5620">feeding instinct died. And so they weren't
our ancestors. And so what happens to the</p>
<p t="704680" d="5720">bulimic is, something will upset them, and
then they'll get an uncontrollable desire</p>
<p t="710400" d="4960">for often something that's high-calorie
and sweet and full of fat, logically enough,</p>
<p t="715360" d="3080">because they're starving, and then they'll
eat a whole quart of ice cream and two loaves</p>
<p t="718440" d="3150">of bread.
And you know, they describe the state that</p>
<p t="721590" d="3701">they're in while they're doing that as
dissociative. You know, it doesn't feel</p>
<p t="725291" d="7139">like them. Well you can imagine why, in some
sense. It partly is the whole realm of eating</p>
<p t="732430" d="4050">behaviour. And eating is a sub-personality,
it's not just a behaviour and it's not</p>
<p t="736480" d="6370">a drive. When you think about when you're
hungry, it's not like your brain is moving</p>
<p t="742850" d="5760">you literally step by determined step. It's
that you start fantasizing about food and</p>
<p t="748610" d="3830">you start thinking about what you maybe want
and then you start to make plans about where</p>
<p t="752440" d="5150">you're going to go or how you're going
to cook it and what social surround there's</p>
<p t="757590" d="6280">going to be and a whole bunch of things, and
that's the hungry you. Well in an anorexic</p>
<p t="763870" d="7290">or a bulimic, the hungry part of the person
is so dissociated from the ego part, that</p>
<p t="771160" d="4550">they're basically in a war. But one of the
problems with being in a war with your hypothalamus</p>
<p t="775710" d="4440">is that it almost always wins. And it's
a good thing, because otherwise you die. And</p>
<p t="780150" d="3440">lots of anorexics do manage to starve themselves
to death.</p>
<p t="783590" d="5791">And so that's a good example of just exactly
how dissociable the mind can be. And the mind</p>
<p t="789381" d="6439">is also… the brain is dissociable in the
strangest possible ways. So here's an example.</p>
<p t="795820" d="5890">I don't remember the name of this syndrome,
it might pop into my mind. So you can have</p>
<p t="801710" d="6040">a particular kind of stroke, and here's
the effect of the stroke. You develop the</p>
<p t="807750" d="10240">fixed delusion that a person who's very
close to you (Capgras syndrome) has died or</p>
<p t="817990" d="7470">been kidnapped, or somehow disappeared, and
has been replaced by their exact double. And</p>
<p t="825460" d="6190">so it's obviously something… it manifests
itself as something akin to psychosis. And</p>
<p t="831650" d="6590">what happens is that the stroke damages the
relationship between, generally, the visual</p>
<p t="838240" d="6420">systems that identify faces and the emotional
systems that tag the identified face with</p>
<p t="844660" d="4320">familiar emotion. So basically what happens,
let's say it happens to you and it's your</p>
<p t="848980" d="4110">mother… you look at your mother, but it
isn't your mother. You know, your mother</p>
<p t="853090" d="6030">comes with a whole complex of memories, and
you know, she's set in a very broad context</p>
<p t="859120" d="4730">of memory and emotion. And then you look at
this person, and it looks like your mother,</p>
<p t="863850" d="4040">but none of that is happening. And so then
you develop this idea that well, if it's</p>
<p t="867890" d="3980">not my mother and looks exactly like my mother,
well then what could possibly be going on?</p>
<p t="871870" d="6480">And the answer is well obviously she's been
taken away and replaced by her exact duplicate.</p>
<p t="878350" d="3350">People get into real trouble with this sort
of delusion, as you might imagine, because</p>
<p t="881700" d="5100">they get obsessed with trying to solve the
problem: what did you do with my mother? And</p>
<p t="886800" d="7979">you can understand why but here's a weirder
thing, which is that it's modality-specific.</p>
<p t="894779" d="5151">So that if they listen to their mother on
the phone, that's their mother. So you see</p>
<p t="899930" d="7290">exactly how dissociable the brain is, the
mind is. Even down to small sub-functions.</p>
<p t="907220" d="3770">So there are people with strokes who can sing
but who can't talk. And there are people</p>
<p t="910990" d="4630">who lose nouns and there are people who lose
only verbs. And there are people who can identify</p>
<p t="915620" d="6590">things but they can't name them. So the
idea that the brain is a dissociable entity</p>
<p t="922210" d="4250">is obviously correct. And here's another
example of it.</p>
<p t="926460" d="7210">Well you dissociate all the time. Now if you
look at the way the brain is structured. So</p>
<p t="933670" d="5200">there's a strip right about here called
the motor strip. And if you're doing brain</p>
<p t="938870" d="4090">surgery and you touch someone with an electrode
on that strip they'll move the corresponding</p>
<p t="942960" d="6000">part of the body. And the hands are very,
very over-represented, and so is the face</p>
<p t="948960" d="5130">and the lips and the tongue, for obvious reasons.
We fiddle around with the world a lot, we</p>
<p t="954090" d="4620">move our arms and our hands a lot. The feet
are over-represented too. And then we communicate</p>
<p t="958710" d="7319">about that with our face and our tongues.
So there's huge representation there. And</p>
<p t="966029" d="6281">if you touch that you get motion, or at least
the person will describe a strong impulse</p>
<p t="972310" d="5279">to move. Well out of that grew the pre-frontal
cortex. And the best way to think… people</p>
<p t="977589" d="6571">think about that as the substrate of abstract.
It's not really a good way of thinking about</p>
<p t="984160" d="6550">it, because you're not really out to think.
You're out to act. And the reason you think</p>
<p t="990710" d="5660">is so that you can try out some actions in
a little world of fantasy before you implement</p>
<p t="996370" d="6180">them in your behaviour. So to think things
through means to conjure up an abstracted</p>
<p t="1002550" d="5890">world and then to conjure up a representation
of yourself acting in that world to calculate</p>
<p t="1008440" d="4040">the consequences and then to decide whether
you're going to implement it. Well that's</p>
<p t="1012480" d="4669">another form of dissociability. Because you
could think without acting.</p>
<p t="1017149" d="4641">Now, you know, it's certainly that part
of you that's able to conjure up the alternative</p>
<p t="1021790" d="5430">worlds that human beings seem to particularly
identify with, you know. That part that's</p>
<p t="1027220" d="3609">thinking… at least modern people really
think of the part that's thinking as them,</p>
<p t="1030829" d="4921">or the part that's capable of conjuring
up abstract ideas. And if it wasn't dissociable</p>
<p t="1035750" d="3540">you'd just act out everything you thought.
Well that wouldn't work very well. So the</p>
<p t="1039290" d="5901">brain is actually designed, in many ways,
so to speak, to be dissociable. So if you</p>
<p t="1045191" d="8499">understand that, and then you understand the
two sets of phenomena that are likely to be</p>
<p t="1053690" d="5610">dissociated, then you kind of got the essence
of Freudian theory. And the things that are</p>
<p t="1059300" d="5980">likely to be dissociated are 1) memories that
were traumatic, and I'll talk about that</p>
<p t="1065280" d="5820">in a minute, and 2) impulses… they're
not impulses, they're not even drives, which</p>
<p t="1071100" d="3770">was the Freudian way of thinking about it,
they're sub-personalities… troublesome</p>
<p t="1074870" d="5530">sub-personalities. And you can imagine that
those would be linked to complex positive</p>
<p t="1080400" d="9100">and negative emotions. One might be resentment,
guilt, shame, anger, anxiety, jealousy, rage,</p>
<p t="1089500" d="6390">lust, all of those emotions are difficult
to integrate into a personality properly,</p>
<p t="1095890" d="8410">partly because, in their pure manifestation,
they're not… they disrupt the social order.</p>
<p t="1104300" d="6080">So like, think about how well regulated all
of you are sitting here. You think, well you're…</p>
<p t="1110380" d="6890">it's six million years since you diverged
from chimpanzees. If we took a bunch of chimpanzees</p>
<p t="1117270" d="4789">that knew each other as well as you know each
other, this place would be an absolute brutal</p>
<p t="1122059" d="8141">massacre. So, you know, for whatever reason,
you can control your primordial instincts,</p>
<p t="1130200" d="4310">that's one way of looking at it, that's
how Freud would look at it, you learn to control</p>
<p t="1134510" d="5720">them. And Freud's theory, and this is where
it differs from the theories that we talked</p>
<p t="1140230" d="5320">about earlier, say with regards to Piaget,
Freud's theory is really more about control.</p>
<p t="1145550" d="8120">He thought of all these potential sub-systems
and memories conflicting with each other.</p>
<p t="1153670" d="5580">Like a war. Like a Hobbesian war. So Hobbes
was the philosopher who said that life is</p>
<p t="1159250" d="4990">nasty, brutal, and short, and that in this
state of nature everyone is at war with everyone</p>
<p t="1164240" d="8880">else. And so you need a Leviathan, a top-down
control system, who will punish any deviance</p>
<p t="1173120" d="5580">from the social contract. Well that's the
Freudian super-ego. Now Freud thought of the</p>
<p t="1178700" d="4310">unconscious and the conscious mind to begin
with, but later he dissociated that up into</p>
<p t="1183010" d="7030">id, ego, and super-ego. And then he thought
that each of those had their unconscious elements.</p>
<p t="1190040" d="7519">So you, if you're under the grip of an id-related
sub-personality, let's say, you could be</p>
<p t="1197559" d="4861">conscious of that, but there's the possibility
for all sorts of other id-related sub-personalities</p>
<p t="1202420" d="5290">to emerge, so those would be in your unconscious.
And it's also possible, and highly likely,</p>
<p t="1207710" d="4310">in fact, that the way that you're perceiving
the world and the way you're acting in it,</p>
<p t="1212020" d="5490">and even what you state as your goals are
influenced in ways that you don't understand</p>
<p t="1217510" d="5160">by the action of these unconscious systems.
So for example, maybe some of you are headed</p>
<p t="1222670" d="4379">for medical school, and if I ask you why you'll
give me six humanitarian reasons, but the</p>
<p t="1227049" d="5631">actual reason is because your grandmother
would be disappointed if you weren't. And</p>
<p t="1232680" d="4410">she might not even be alive anymore, you know,
she may have… your mother may have imitated</p>
<p t="1237090" d="6740">your grandmother so that that ideal is firmly
embodied in her, and that set up the unspoken</p>
<p t="1243830" d="4170">expectations about your behaviour ever since
you were a tiny child.</p>
<p t="1248000" d="4530">So that's an interesting sub-element of
psychodynamic theory too, and it's really</p>
<p t="1252530" d="5700">something to watch for in your personal relationships.
It's very, very frequently, if you watch</p>
<p t="1258230" d="4410">carefully, that you can see someone, especially
someone you love, because you have to know</p>
<p t="1262640" d="6010">them well, being taken over, in some sense,
by the spirit of one of their ancestors. And</p>
<p t="1268650" d="8810">I don't mean this in a metaphysical way.
I mean that the thought… the personality</p>
<p t="1277460" d="5270">of the grandmother or the personality of the
mother has a structure that's well-known</p>
<p t="1282730" d="5850">to the individual in question, and that individual
spent a lot of time imitating them in all</p>
<p t="1288580" d="5280">sorts of ways. And those imitated structures
can be passed down generation to generation.</p>
<p t="1293860" d="6360">I mean in fact, that's partly what constitutes
your culture, right? It's the imitated personality</p>
<p t="1300220" d="5030">of all of your ancestors that constitutes
your culture. And those things can possess.</p>
<p t="1305250" d="5260">Ideologies possess you in… not exactly the
same way, but in a similar way.</p>
<p t="1310510" d="6600">Okay, so you've got the id, and you've
got the ego and the super-ego. And, as in</p>
<p t="1317110" d="4400">the Hobbesian worldview, there's real tension
between them, so that the id is always trying</p>
<p t="1321510" d="9370">to get its base gratifications, its base desires
gratified. Now, in Freudian times, that was</p>
<p t="1330880" d="5830">mostly problematic in relationship to sex.
And the reasons for that are quite clear.</p>
<p t="1336710" d="8230">There was no valid birth control, there was
very little employment option for women, so</p>
<p t="1344940" d="4120">their sexual behaviour had to be very, very
tightly regulated or they'd fall outside</p>
<p t="1349060" d="5070">of the social structure into prostitution,
or something like that, and then there was</p>
<p t="1354130" d="5040">the threat of various venereal diseases, most
particularly syphilis, which is as awful a</p>
<p t="1359170" d="5610">disease as you can imagine. It can imitate
or mimic all sorts of other diseases, and</p>
<p t="1364780" d="7390">it's transmissible from mother to child.
So it's a nasty one. So it was very difficult</p>
<p t="1372170" d="6600">for the Victorians to integrate sexuality,
because well, exactly how did you do that?</p>
<p t="1378770" d="5980">The one pathway to potential integration,
something the super-ego would approve of,</p>
<p t="1384750" d="5549">was a martial pathway. But you know, people
back then, back in the 1960s, people were</p>
<p t="1390299" d="5831">getting married around 19 or 20, but that's
actually a historical anomaly. I mean, typically</p>
<p t="1396130" d="4220">speaking, in the Victorian age, a man usually
couldn't afford to get married till he was</p>
<p t="1400350" d="4390">in his mid-to-late twenties, he just didn't
have the resources. Women were married usually</p>
<p t="1404740" d="4090">younger than that.
But so there was a long period of time, for</p>
<p t="1408830" d="6440">men particularly, but also for women, where
the sexual drive, from a Freudian perspective,</p>
<p t="1415270" d="8180">was fully flourishing, fully manifesting itself,
but there was no socially approved mode of</p>
<p t="1423450" d="5150">expression. And so, under those conditions,
there's a war between the id and the super-ego,</p>
<p t="1428600" d="4860">and the poor little ego is crushed in the
middle. Now you could certainly see that when</p>
<p t="1433460" d="4550">we were watching the movie, the Crumb brothers
movie, because they were basically in the</p>
<p t="1438010" d="4790">same situation. There was no socially approved
way that they could manifest any sexual or</p>
<p t="1442800" d="6950">any aggressive behaviour. And what happened
as a consequence was that both of those fundamental</p>
<p t="1449750" d="5480">sub-personalities, let's call them, become
incredibly pathologised. Particularly characterised</p>
<p t="1455230" d="6430">by resentment and the desire for revenge.
Because remember these systems think… if</p>
<p t="1461660" d="4810">someone's excruciatingly sexually frustrated,
let's say, and let's think about it in</p>
<p t="1466470" d="6810">the broader scheme of things, because sexuality
isn't really… it's not a narrow uni-dimensional</p>
<p t="1473280" d="5690">drive. You know, it's associated with playfulness,
and it's associated with the desire for</p>
<p t="1478970" d="4660">social contact, and the desire for communication,
and the desire for touch… like it's a</p>
<p t="1483630" d="5480">complicated, multi-branching phenomenon. Well,
in the case of the people who we were watching</p>
<p t="1489110" d="6460">in the movie, none of that was either integrated
into their personalities, let's say, or</p>
<p t="1495570" d="6710">permitted by society. And so it was bent and
warped and frustrated and then generated all</p>
<p t="1502280" d="8200">sorts of ideas about resentment and revenge
around it. So you can develop an incredibly</p>
<p t="1510480" d="5530">pathological sub-personality.
In the one cartoon if you remember, it was</p>
<p t="1516010" d="6230">the one that was most disturbing, where Mr.
Natural brought Robert that headless woman.</p>
<p t="1522240" d="8040">So he wanted pure gratification without responsibility.
So it's a really id driven phenomenon. So</p>
<p t="1530280" d="5320">he had intercourse with her and immediately
after that was unbelievably guilty. And you</p>
<p t="1535600" d="4500">can see… so you think about what that must
mean. It's like someone is under the grip</p>
<p t="1540100" d="4880">of one sub-personality, and it's shaping
all of their thoughts and their memories and</p>
<p t="1544980" d="3800">their emotions. And all of a sudden that becomes
gratified, so it's satiated, it disappears</p>
<p t="1548780" d="5830">and bang, up comes the other one. And in this
particular example it was guilt and shame</p>
<p t="1554610" d="5740">and anxiety, terror even, and self-loathing,
all of those things. And if you read about</p>
<p t="1560350" d="5090">the experiences of people who commit particularly
atrocious crimes, it's very, very common</p>
<p t="1565440" d="4970">for them to experience exactly that. They're
driven by sexual/aggressive impulses, because</p>
<p t="1570410" d="8120">those are the ones generally that culminate
in particularly atrocious individual crimes.</p>
<p t="1578530" d="3880">And then they'll commit them and instantly
flip back into their normative personality,</p>
<p t="1582410" d="4330">except they're absolutely terrified by what
they did. And you know, it's… more than</p>
<p t="1586740" d="7060">one person is inhabiting the same psyche.
Now, they're tied together by memory, generally</p>
<p t="1593800" d="5740">speaking, although Freud would say you can
also dissociate memory. And so Freud talked</p>
<p t="1599540" d="7259">about memories being repressed. And that's
caused an awful lot of trouble, for a whole</p>
<p t="1606799" d="13611">variety of reasons. Because memory is not
the objective recording… it's not the</p>
<p t="1620410" d="9040">objective unbiased recording of actually occurring
events. First of all because you can't objectively</p>
<p t="1629450" d="4150">record certain kinds of events, like we talked
about this before. You can't really objectively</p>
<p t="1633600" d="5209">record a discussion between a man and a woman
who've been married for 20 years about anything</p>
<p t="1638809" d="6161">important because for them, each word and
each phrase and each sentence and each facial</p>
<p t="1644970" d="5319">expression has to be interpreted within the
context of the entire relationship in order</p>
<p t="1650289" d="4911">for the meaning of the utterances to be extracted.
And there's just no way you can record that</p>
<p t="1655200" d="4880">in a video. You'd have to have videoed the
entire relationship. And so you're not going</p>
<p t="1660080" d="4550">to do that. And so memory is a very, very
peculiar thing, and the idea that you could</p>
<p t="1664630" d="4909">have an objective record is not a very sophisticated
idea.</p>
<p t="1669539" d="10451">Anyways, Freud idea, in some sense… he had
a somewhat… I hate to say… it was an insufficiently</p>
<p t="1679990" d="5010">sophisticated notion of what memory was. Now
I hate to say that, because Freud was a very</p>
<p t="1685000" d="6000">sophisticated person. But he did, in some
sense, believe in the existence of an objective</p>
<p t="1691000" d="4110">interpersonal world. And so he thought that
if something terrible happened to you when</p>
<p t="1695110" d="5120">you were a child, that you had a record of
the memory. It was there, as the memory, as</p>
<p t="1700230" d="7189">the event. And then you needed something that
would, like a censor that would repress that,</p>
<p t="1707419" d="6781">and then you needed a place for it to be repressed
into, which would be the unconscious. But</p>
<p t="1714200" d="6370">if you take apart a traumatic memory, generally
speaking, with someone… sorry, he [Freud]</p>
<p t="1720570" d="9440">also thought that repressed memory might be
represented in a symptom, a symbolic symptom.</p>
<p t="1730010" d="8390">So I think that the repression theory suffers
from the inadequacy of its representation</p>
<p t="1738400" d="3490">of memory, because here's a different way
of thinking about it. It's more in keeping</p>
<p t="1741890" d="5140">with the layer model, a hierarchical layer
model that we've been entertaining as we've</p>
<p t="1747030" d="5080">progressed.
So imagine that you're molested by your</p>
<p t="1752110" d="6140">uncle, because it's usually a family member,
when you're four. Sexually molested. Okay,</p>
<p t="1758250" d="5120">the first thing you have to ask yourself is
just exactly what kind of memory do you have?</p>
<p t="1763370" d="4390">Imagine you're completely sexually naïve,
which basically means you know nothing about</p>
<p t="1767760" d="5650">the sexual act, and its implications, or the
mechanics, but this happens to you. So the</p>
<p t="1773410" d="6550">first question is, how do you represent that?
Because to remember something you have to</p>
<p t="1779960" d="4849">represent it, that's the thing. Because
you don't just have a memory of the event.</p>
<p t="1784809" d="6490">It's always interpretation, because there's
so many things going on. Well so, maybe your</p>
<p t="1791299" d="6201">representation is pain and confusion, something
like that. And then there'd be another layer</p>
<p t="1797500" d="5120">over that, which would be the necessity for
secrecy. Because of course, the person who</p>
<p t="1802620" d="5190">does the molesting is going to tell you, well
one of two things, three maybe: it's good</p>
<p t="1807810" d="6080">for you, you asked for it, don't tell anyone
or they'll think you're a bad person,</p>
<p t="1813890" d="5190">this will be our little secret. Something
like that. So then there's that whole overlay</p>
<p t="1819080" d="5430">of secrecy and inadmissibility, and what are
you supposed to do about that when you're</p>
<p t="1824510" d="3960">four? How are you supposed to understand that
soemthign has just transpired that you're</p>
<p t="1828470" d="4420">not allowed to share with anyone? You don't
have a model of the world that's sophisticated</p>
<p t="1832890" d="5960">enough to account for all that.
And so then perhaps from then on what you</p>
<p t="1838850" d="4800">do is avoid thinking about it. Now that's
not the same thing as repression. Avoiding</p>
<p t="1843650" d="4080">thinking about something is not the same as
repression. Because it doesn't require an</p>
<p t="1847730" d="7740">act of repress in order to do it. And then
maybe, you know, years later, you start to</p>
<p t="1855470" d="7810">recall what happened. But what you recall
is an unclear mess. And maybe most of it…</p>
<p t="1863280" d="5210">because you might say, well how are things
represented as memories when you can't develop</p>
<p t="1868490" d="5000">a sophisticated representation? And what seems
to happen, and this is in a sense, the reverse</p>
<p t="1873490" d="10799">of Freudian theory, is that the event is represented
in the body. And so you can think about the</p>
<p t="1884289" d="6531">representation of event as a multilayered
neurological phenomenon. And so if you encounter</p>
<p t="1890820" d="3880">something that's unexpected or frightening,
the first thing that happens is that very,</p>
<p t="1894700" d="5180">very ancient reflexive systems act first.
And those things are fast.</p>
<p t="1899880" d="3890">And so that's the sort of thing that, for
example, might protect you against a snake</p>
<p t="1903770" d="3649">bite. If a snake jumped out at you you're
going to jump backwards, and believe me, you</p>
<p t="1907419" d="3991">do that before you even see the snake. Because
it probably takes you a quarter of a second</p>
<p t="1911410" d="5710">to produce a complex visual representation
of the snake. And if you wait around for a</p>
<p t="1917120" d="4380">quarter of a second, then you're dead. And
so what's happened is that your nervous</p>
<p t="1921500" d="6610">system has conserved basic reflexes that are
only a few synapses long. And so maybe those</p>
<p t="1928110" d="5350">work between your retina and your spinal cord.
Your retina and maybe a very primordial emotional</p>
<p t="1933460" d="4719">system, like the amygdala, is wired up to
detect things like snakes and it just sends</p>
<p t="1938179" d="5521">a message down to your spinal cord, or slightly
more sophisticated motor control systems that</p>
<p t="1943700" d="4450">says “jump backwards now'. And then maybe,
you think about it, it isn't even till after</p>
<p t="1948150" d="4620">that that your heart rate goes up and your
blood pressure goes up and you start to breathe</p>
<p t="1952770" d="5080">heavily, and then there's a wave of fear
and revulsion, which is perhaps there to teach</p>
<p t="1957850" d="5200">you not to do such a stupid thing again. You
know, we don't exactly know why you would</p>
<p t="1963050" d="4851">experience negative emotion, you know, or
what function a negative emotion has, except</p>
<p t="1967901" d="5658">that we do know that a pattern of neurological
behaviour that's followed by a punishment,</p>
<p t="1973559" d="5850">or a threat, is less likely to be re-implemented
in the future.</p>
<p t="1979409" d="6270">Okay, so the reaction to the anomalous thing
is body, and then maybe it's emotion, and</p>
<p t="1985679" d="5561">then maybe it's image, like imagination,
you know, what just happened? And then maybe</p>
<p t="1991240" d="5600">it's articulated speech. But lots of things
don't get past image to articulated speech,</p>
<p t="1996840" d="8830">and some things, I think, don't even get
past body. [Dr. Peterson's phone rings]</p>
<p t="2005670" d="7170">Sorry about that. So I don't think that
these traumatic memories are so much repressed,</p>
<p t="2012840" d="4839">as Freud had it, as never brought forward
for development.</p>
<p t="2017679" d="6240">So I'll tell you a story about how this
might work, okay? So one time I had this client,</p>
<p t="2023919" d="5341">and she was 27, and I only saw her once. This
was when I was just training to be a psychotherapist.</p>
<p t="2029260" d="5720">And she came in to see me and she said that
she had been plagued by these thoughts of</p>
<p t="2034980" d="6410">being sexually abused when she was a child.
And I said, well, who was doing this to you?</p>
<p t="2041390" d="5200">And she said, well it was my brother. And
she said, he was a lot older than me. And</p>
<p t="2046590" d="5360">so I formulated this mental model of her being,
you know, somewhere between 10 and 13 and</p>
<p t="2051950" d="6109">her brother being somewhere between 15 and
20, because the way she described it was that</p>
<p t="2058059" d="6631">she was overpowered by a physically larger
male. So we talked for a while. And then she</p>
<p t="2064690" d="3409">finally told me… I said well how old were
you when this happened? And she said well</p>
<p t="2068099" d="6020">I was four. Okay, and then I said, well okay,
how old was your brother? And she said well</p>
<p t="2074119" d="6621">he was six. And so I said well look, you know,
here's one way of looking at it. Like you're</p>
<p t="2080740" d="3760">looking at it from the perspective of the
four-year-old. It's a regression, in some</p>
<p t="2084500" d="6619">sense. That's still how old you are as far
as experiencing the memory. Here's an alternative</p>
<p t="2091119" d="7710">hypothesis. Your brother wasn't a predator,
you were both terribly supervised children.</p>
<p t="2098829" d="6260">Well, you know, that made the lights go on
in her mind. Because she never thought about</p>
<p t="2105089" d="4880">it that way. Like she'd never taken that
representation, which would be her emotional</p>
<p t="2109969" d="3991">experience as a four-year-old related to a
six-year-old… a six-year-old is a lot bigger</p>
<p t="2113960" d="6960">and more powerful than a four-year-old, right?
It's like 50% older, so it's a big deal</p>
<p t="2120920" d="8470">when you're four. But if the issue for the
memory is its relevance to current conceptualisation</p>
<p t="2129390" d="5280">and behaviour, it was much better for her
to update the memory, in a sense, and think,</p>
<p t="2134670" d="5159">well, yeah, like a six-year-old's this high,
and a four-year-old's this high, and what</p>
<p t="2139829" d="4790">the hell were my parents doing anyways? And
that's an entirely different story than</p>
<p t="2144619" d="3960">the one that she had come in with.
And you know, that seemed to be a great relief</p>
<p t="2148579" d="5510">to her, and that's partly because, you know,
if you're bothered by a traumatic memory,</p>
<p t="2154089" d="4960">it keeps resurfacing on you, which it will,
and it's actually one of the ways of identifying</p>
<p t="2159049" d="3351">a traumatic memory, it's that the thing
won't leave you alone. It'll keep coming</p>
<p t="2162400" d="4760">up in dreams and when your mind is wandering,
it'll keep coming up when your mind is wandering,</p>
<p t="2167160" d="4570">and maybe it'll come up when you're going
to sleep at night, like it invades your mind.</p>
<p t="2171730" d="5770">There's a reason for that, and the reason
is is that the underlying emotional systems</p>
<p t="2177500" d="6530">that are associated with anxiety, so those
are mostly the hippocampus and amygdala duo,</p>
<p t="2184030" d="6380">in some sense, that are mediating those, they're
an alarm system. And the alarm is something</p>
<p t="2190410" d="4119">that's potentially dangerous has happened,
you need to figure out what it means so you</p>
<p t="2194529" d="5421">can stop that from happening in the future.
Okay so you need a plan. And to get a plan</p>
<p t="2199950" d="6059">you have to do a causal analysis of the relationship
between your behaviour and the traumatic outcome.</p>
<p t="2206009" d="4121">That would be the first thing. And then you
have to come up with a way that that won't</p>
<p t="2210130" d="4989">happen again. And, of course, for my client,
that happened pretty much right away, because</p>
<p t="2215119" d="5671">now she was a 27-year-old woman and the probability
that she was going to be subject in any serious</p>
<p t="2220790" d="7289">way to a situation the same as the one she
was remembering was zero.</p>
<p t="2228079" d="7480">And I've seen this in other clients too,
is when they're… okay, I had another client,</p>
<p t="2235559" d="5530">who, when she was, I think I told you about
her briefly, when she was young, four years</p>
<p t="2241089" d="5081">old, she jumped in a shopping cart and went
down a hill, like a paved hill, in the shopping</p>
<p t="2246170" d="3949">cart and spilled out at the bottom and hurt
herself. And they took her to the hospital.</p>
<p t="2250119" d="5390">And then, you know, she's all primed for
being threatened. So that kind of means you're</p>
<p t="2255509" d="4820">open to rewiring. And so then when she's
in the hospital they don't let her parents</p>
<p t="2260329" d="5460">come and see her for a couple of weeks. So
the trauma, the pain and the anxiety and the</p>
<p t="2265789" d="3871">threat and the ambulance ride and all those
things, which sort of puts her in a state</p>
<p t="2269660" d="5990">like this, which might be a, like a, state
that's particularly conducive to learning,</p>
<p t="2275650" d="4069">because if something traumatic is happening,
you should be learning about that, what the</p>
<p t="2279719" d="7471">world's like around that right now. And
she developed a permanent trauma-related paranoia</p>
<p t="2287190" d="5460">about institutions, which turned, by the time
met her, had turned into a whole philosophy</p>
<p t="2292650" d="5839">of institutional oppression. But its core
was that, and you know, rightly so, its core</p>
<p t="2298489" d="8031">was that combination of physiological trauma
and psychological trauma. And you know, mishandling</p>
<p t="2306520" d="6500">of the situation by people in authority.
So you can see under those circumstances how</p>
<p t="2313020" d="5039">a traumatic memory can become a core of a
whole large sub-personality, and that has</p>
<p t="2318059" d="4940">to be taken apart very carefully, especially
if that subpersonality isn't the kind that</p>
<p t="2322999" d="5671">can be easily integrated into the world. So
for example, if you're paranoid about all</p>
<p t="2328670" d="4079">institutions, you're in real trouble, because
in a modern world, you're faced with the</p>
<p t="2332749" d="5100">necessity of dealing with institutions all
the time. And if you're more distrustful</p>
<p t="2337849" d="5170">and paranoid about them than you could be
if you were sophisticated, all that's going</p>
<p t="2343019" d="4050">to happen is they're going to continually
mistreat you. Because I mean if a dog comes</p>
<p t="2347069" d="4010">up to you and it's looking suspiciously
and it's barking and growling, you're</p>
<p t="2351079" d="7881">not going to pet it. The way that you interact
with the system depends… the reaction of</p>
<p t="2358960" d="4909">a system to you is dependent, to a large degree,
on how you approach the system.</p>
<p t="2363869" d="7360">So anyways, the dissocaibility idea is a really
good one. I mean, if you want to get to know</p>
<p t="2371229" d="4961">yourself better, and this is sort of a combination
of Freudian and Jungian ideas, one of the</p>
<p t="2376190" d="4710">things to do is to… so imagine that you
have some sort of goal in mind. The first</p>
<p t="2380900" d="6230">question that you might ask yourself is, why
do you have that goal? What are the influences</p>
<p t="2387130" d="5239">on you that have set that goal up, because
it easily could be conscious or partially</p>
<p t="2392369" d="6190">conscious, or poorly explained, or implicit,
any of those things. So you want to know that,</p>
<p t="2398559" d="7161">why are you doing what you're doing? And
the second thing is, if you find yourself</p>
<p t="2405720" d="6519">avoiding things on the way to that goal, the
next question is, why are you avoiding them?</p>
<p t="2412239" d="3850">And you know, that'll mean delving into
parts of yourself that are quite hidden and</p>
<p t="2416089" d="4690">quite uncomfortable. So for example, if you
discover that the reason you're pursuing</p>
<p t="2420779" d="6270">a particular goal is because it's what your
parents want you to do, one question that</p>
<p t="2427049" d="4960">immediately arises is, yeah but is that what
you want to do?</p>
<p t="2432009" d="5191">And, you know, that's a very complicated
question. Because you'd have to dissociate</p>
<p t="2437200" d="4669">the part of you that's ‘the you that doesn't
want to do it' from the part of you that's</p>
<p t="2441869" d="3710">‘the you that does want to do it'. And
then you'd have to figure out why in the</p>
<p t="2445579" d="4750">world you'd be avoiding. So you know, it
might be that you're unbelievably angry</p>
<p t="2450329" d="5381">that you've been tilted towards this particular
goal for reasons that have nothing to do with</p>
<p t="2455710" d="7119">your choice, and so that every time you have
the opportunity to study, or accomplish something</p>
<p t="2462829" d="4681">that would move you farther to that goal,
you're either not motivated, so you can't</p>
<p t="2467510" d="4539">pay attention, you can't study, you can't
learn, and you procrastinate all the time,</p>
<p t="2472049" d="8581">or you do seriously counter-productive things.
So people for example, people can be… I</p>
<p t="2480630" d="4701">just had someone write me here a while ago,
because he was watching the YouTube lectures,</p>
<p t="2485331" d="5609">and he said that he had dreams for six weeks
that he drove his car off a cliff and crashed</p>
<p t="2490940" d="5049">it. And then, at the end of the dream series
he drove his car off the cliff and crashed</p>
<p t="2495989" d="4330">it. And he asked me what that meant. And I
said well, the dream is telling you that you're</p>
<p t="2500319" d="6811">being far too careless with your life. I mean,
that's what driving a car off a cliff repeatedly</p>
<p t="2507130" d="5020">means. It's like, you know, that's a good
descent, unconscious descent, into the underworld.</p>
<p t="2512150" d="8800">Well, and he was being warned, the psychological
reality was such that the warning was extremely</p>
<p t="2520950" d="3960">serious and so was the danger. And so then
you might say, well why would he drive himself</p>
<p t="2524910" d="4520">off a cliff? Well, you know, that's a suicidal
gesture. And then you might ask, well why</p>
<p t="2529430" d="3859">would somebody be suicidal, and that could
be, well they're out for revenge against</p>
<p t="2533289" d="2891">their parents, or they're out for revenge
against the whole world, or they're out</p>
<p t="2536180" d="4849">for revenge against themselves, or they just
want to make their painful consciousness go</p>
<p t="2541029" d="5090">away, or they're living a messy and pointless
and painful life, and they want to punish</p>
<p t="2546119" d="4970">themselves for it. You know, it's very,
very complicated and tangled down there at</p>
<p t="2551089" d="4230">the bottom of things, and people don't really
like to look into it, and I suppose to some</p>
<p t="2555319" d="5950">degree that's the shadow element. Because
what you find there is seldom what you want.</p>
<p t="2561269" d="6350">I mean one of the prime dictums of Jungian
psychotherapy, and most psychotherapies are</p>
<p t="2567619" d="3720">predicated on the idea that you should find
out what you're avoiding and then you should</p>
<p t="2571339" d="4910">figure out how to voluntarily face it. Now,
you might add to that, you should find out</p>
<p t="2576249" d="5360">what you're doing and why, and see if that's
actually what you want to be doing. And if</p>
<p t="2581609" d="4801">those reasons are reasons you like. That might,
you know, in some sense sum up therapy in</p>
<p t="2586410" d="7320">a couple of phrases. But in order to manage
that, then you have to look at all the things</p>
<p t="2593730" d="4589">you've been avoiding. Well, what do you
avoid? Well, it isn't rainbows and cookies,</p>
<p t="2598319" d="6311">right? The things that you avoid are the things
that no one wants to look at. And so, Jung's</p>
<p t="2604630" d="5829">primary dictum for his psychotherapeutic practice
was a Latin phrase, which is ‘instercuilinis</p>
<p t="2610459" d="4900">invinoteur' which I'm probably pronouncing
wrong, which means either ‘in filth it will</p>
<p t="2615359" d="5510">be found', or ‘where you want most is
to be found where you least want to look'.</p>
<p t="2620869" d="7611">And you know those… that's a horrible
philosophy. But you can see that it's almost</p>
<p t="2628480" d="4249">self-fulfilling, because of course the things
you're going to avoid are the things you</p>
<p t="2632729" d="5850">don't want to face. Obviously.
Now, the shadow element of the psyche, in</p>
<p t="2638579" d="6270">some sense, when you were watching the movie,
for example, you saw these drives, mostly</p>
<p t="2644849" d="3400">sexual and aggressive, that were manifesting
themselves in all sorts of ways. And so that</p>
<p t="2648249" d="5870">would be maybe the repressed or unincorporated
elements of the id. But then there was another</p>
<p t="2654119" d="9761">more complex side of that, where the… people
were reacting to that, because they felt downtrodden</p>
<p t="2663880" d="7619">and oppressed and anti-social and critical
of social structure and all of that. Because</p>
<p t="2671499" d="5350">they were unable to manifest themselves properly
in the world. And that produced fantasies</p>
<p t="2676849" d="5470">of extreme destruction, exceptional destruction.
And for them they were mostly sexually related.</p>
<p t="2682319" d="5411">But for other people that can manifest itself
in incredibly violent fantasies about the</p>
<p t="2687730" d="6840">destruction of society as such. So if you
can't invite all the parts of you out to</p>
<p t="2694570" d="4380">play, the parts that get left behind are not
very happy about it, and they don't just</p>
<p t="2698950" d="5540">sit around having a tea party. They turn into,
especially as you mature, they turn into these</p>
<p t="2704490" d="7570">warped monsters. And their mode of action
in the world is anything but positive.</p>
<p t="2712060" d="6700">And a Freudian world… like the world of
the psychoanalytic unconscious, is quite a</p>
<p t="2718760" d="7490">terrifying place, because it makes you second-guess
everything. It's like, it's not a paranoia.</p>
<p t="2726250" d="8739">It's very, very difficult, once you're
trained psychoanalytically, to ever assume</p>
<p t="2734989" d="5850">that someone's benevolent motivations are
only what they claim they are. You're always</p>
<p t="2740839" d="5331">looking for the other missing piece. And I
think it's extremely useful, you know, because</p>
<p t="2746170" d="4649">you run into people, particularly ideologues,
who will claim that they're acting on the</p>
<p t="2750819" d="7440">world's behalf. It's like, yeah, who made
you a saint? And why should I believe all</p>
<p t="2758259" d="4171">the good is on your side? Like, what is it
that you're not talking about? What is it</p>
<p t="2762430" d="5069">that you're not revealing? I got something
from Greenpeace once, for example, that was</p>
<p t="2767499" d="5691">asking for donations. And the brochure was
just photographs of all the people who were</p>
<p t="2773190" d="7159">on the board. I thought, why do I want to
see photographs of all the people who are</p>
<p t="2780349" d="5301">on the board of Greenpeace? Or, the other
question is, why do they want to show them?</p>
<p t="2785650" d="4879">Well, you don't have to think very hard
to figure that out. You know, it's a status</p>
<p t="2790529" d="4351">manoeuver. What you'd expect in a mail-out
like that is “here's six things that we've</p>
<p t="2794880" d="5790">done in the last six years that have improved
the planet, and here's what we spent, in</p>
<p t="2800670" d="4649">relationship to administrative costs, and
here's why it was a good idea”, not “here's</p>
<p t="2805319" d="5280">our leaders”. Now there's something wrong
there. And I mean, I picked Greenpeace because</p>
<p t="2810599" d="3950">it just happened to pop in mind but it's
the case for all sorts of organisations.</p>
<p t="2814549" d="9861">Alright, so Freud, by 1900, had identified
a lot of different functions of the unconscious,</p>
<p t="2824410" d="5240">and so, here's four of them. One was the
unconscious had a conservative function, which</p>
<p t="2829650" d="5389">meant that it stored memories, often inaccessible
to voluntary recall. Now we don't really</p>
<p t="2835039" d="7260">know how memories are stored in the brain,
but here's a guess. So when you have an</p>
<p t="2842299" d="7591">experience, imagine that that produces a pattern
of neural activity. It's not just neural,</p>
<p t="2849890" d="8629">but a pattern of activity in your brain and
in your body. At least part of how you remember</p>
<p t="2858519" d="5451">is to reactivate that pattern, but it's
not that simple obviously, because otherwise</p>
<p t="2863970" d="6879">you'd act out all your memories precisely,
and we don't know exactly how that initial</p>
<p t="2870849" d="4730">pattern of experience gets edited down to
the thing you remember. But we do know that</p>
<p t="2875579" d="6970">it gets edited down in some ways as a consequence
of its relevance to your current goal structure.</p>
<p t="2882549" d="5471">How that happens? [shrugs] It seems computationally
impossible. We really don't understand how</p>
<p t="2888020" d="4809">it happens at all. We don't understand how
you can compute what's relevant and what</p>
<p t="2892829" d="5540">isn't. It seems that the world is too complex
for that to even be possible.</p>
<p t="2898369" d="7051">So conservative. Dissolutive. The unconscious
contains habits, once voluntary, now automatized,</p>
<p t="2905420" d="6540">and dissociated elements of the personality,
which may lead a parasitic existence. So I</p>
<p t="2911960" d="4809">talked a little bit about traumatic memories,
and how they might form the node of the development</p>
<p t="2916769" d="4731">of the sub-personality, but there's something
else that's worth understanding too. So</p>
<p t="2921500" d="7749">let's say you start practising a new minor
mode of being, a new attitude, or a new personality</p>
<p t="2929249" d="4201">attribute, or a new habit, let's say. It
can be a fairly small thing. When you first</p>
<p t="2933450" d="4849">start practising it, you're not very good
at it. For those of you who are musicians,</p>
<p t="2938299" d="3721">when you first start to play a piece, you're
very inefficient at it. And then the more</p>
<p t="2942020" d="4999">you practice it, the more efficient you get.
It's very weird. I'm not a very good pianist</p>
<p t="2947019" d="4000">but I learned to play one really difficult
song. But the terrible thing is that I'll</p>
<p t="2951019" d="4310">learn to play it, and then at some point I'll
realise I don't know the notes any more,</p>
<p t="2955329" d="3111">and as soon as I realise I don't know the
notes, I can't use those habit patterns</p>
<p t="2958440" d="3740">anymore. And then I have to figure out the
notes again, it's very, very annoying.</p>
<p t="2962180" d="4149">But anyways, when you first start practicing
something, it's effortful, it requires a</p>
<p t="2966329" d="4530">lot of brain activation, that's what the
scanning studies show. But as you practice</p>
<p t="2970859" d="5781">it more and more, the amount of brain that
you use starts to shrink… it generally moves</p>
<p t="2976640" d="4349">left because the right hemisphere is more
involved in novelty processing. It generally</p>
<p t="2980989" d="4391">moves left and then it moves back, and the
area gets smaller and smaller and smaller,</p>
<p t="2985380" d="6369">until you've generated up a little machine.
Or it's a little hard-wired sub-personality</p>
<p t="2991749" d="4641">that takes care of that particular operation.
Now that's worth thinking about too, because</p>
<p t="2996390" d="6050">what that means in some sense is that your
brain is full of the things that you've</p>
<p t="3002440" d="4700">practised. And that's not exactly psychological,
right, it's psychophysiological. It's</p>
<p t="3007140" d="4530">part of your psyche but it's also hard-wired
into your brain. If you want to overcome one</p>
<p t="3011670" d="4929">of those habits you have to build a new machine
that shuts it off. You can't just get rid</p>
<p t="3016599" d="7140">of it. And then what happens if you get stressed
often, that new machine will get… I don't</p>
<p t="3023739" d="4060">know exactly how it happens. The stress will
reduce the functioning of the new machine</p>
<p t="3027799" d="4530">and the old habit will pop back up.
Some of you will have noticed this. How many</p>
<p t="3032329" d="7400">of you have moved away from home? Okay so
how many of you notice, when you go to your</p>
<p t="3039729" d="7820">family of origin, that all sorts of personality
traits that you thought you abandoned immediately</p>
<p t="3047549" d="5780">come flooding back. So you know that sensation,
right? You go back there and it's like bam!</p>
<p t="3053329" d="4220">There's a groove, and you're right in
it. And you know, maybe you're as mature</p>
<p t="3057549" d="3280">as a 30-year-old when you're at your own
house but as soon as you come home, it's</p>
<p t="3060829" d="4601">like poof! You're fourteen again. And it's
partly because of that expectancy situation</p>
<p t="3065430" d="5669">set up by your parents, but it's also partly
because you just don't understand how much</p>
<p t="3071099" d="6510">of your behaviour is automatic and cued by
ongoing events. It's habitual. And so, those,</p>
<p t="3077609" d="5740">you might think of those as somewhat dissociated
elements of the personality as well.</p>
<p t="3083349" d="6811">Creative. The unconscious serves as the matrix
of new ideas. So that's a more Jungian idea</p>
<p t="3090160" d="6020">and the way that seems to work… you might
think, how in the world can you come up with</p>
<p t="3096180" d="5490">a new idea? It doesn't make sense, right?
Because what, are you conjuring something</p>
<p t="3101670" d="5689">out of nothing? Well, and you can say well
they're combinations of old ideas, but that's</p>
<p t="3107359" d="3710">not that helpful because you can't just
take a bunch of old ideas and then shuffle</p>
<p t="3111069" d="4770">them and come up with some new, spectacular
ideas. It's a lot more complicated than</p>
<p t="3115839" d="7891">that. So here's one way to think about…
Freud investigated, in some sense, the surface</p>
<p t="3123730" d="6180">of the creative unconscious, and he was more
concerned about the… Jung called Freud's</p>
<p t="3129910" d="4980">unconscious the personal unconscious. So that
might be the unconscious that you have that's</p>
<p t="3134890" d="4609">related specifically to your experiences,
conscious and unconscious. Like it can be</p>
<p t="3139499" d="6350">deep. Jung had a dream once, for example,
(I hope I've got this right) that Freud</p>
<p t="3145849" d="5610">and him were excavating the basement of a
structure, and that Jung broke through and</p>
<p t="3151459" d="4691">found another huge structure underneath that.
And that's just about exactly right. And</p>
<p t="3156150" d="4620">so there's the personal unconscious and
then underneath that, in theory, there's</p>
<p t="3160770" d="4330">what Jung called the ‘collective unconscious'.
And that would be, God only know what that</p>
<p t="3165100" d="6280">is. But in part what it would be is whatever
it is that makes you human from an evolutionary</p>
<p t="3171380" d="2879">perspective.
And we don't know… like you have a specific</p>
<p t="3174259" d="6300">mode of being that's a human mode of being.
I think it was E. O. Wilson, who's a great</p>
<p t="3180559" d="11000">entomologist and also the originator of sociobiology,
which is like a branch of evolutionary psychology,</p>
<p t="3191559" d="6910">he studied ants forever, and social behaviour
of ants. And he once said if we could talk</p>
<p t="3198469" d="6530">to ants we wouldn't have anything to say
to them. And what he meant by that is that,</p>
<p t="3204999" d="4080">like ants are interested in a bunch of things
that you don't care about at all. Like they're</p>
<p t="3209079" d="6571">not jealous, they don't get jealous, they
don't fall in love, they don't have sexual</p>
<p t="3215650" d="4250">feelings or behaviours. They're not a cognitive
creature. It's like, what the hell are you</p>
<p t="3219900" d="4879">going to talk to an ant about? “How's
it going, carrying that grain of sand?”</p>
<p t="3224779" d="5161">An ant doesn't even care about that. And
so it's interesting, it's really a profound</p>
<p t="3229940" d="4679">observation, because what it indicates is
that you couldn't even communicate with</p>
<p t="3234619" d="6850">someone unless you were 99% the same as they
are. Because to communicate with someone means</p>
<p t="3241469" d="5412">you have to share a whole massive immense
set of presuppositions. So for example, if</p>
<p t="3246881" d="9148">I say I got jealous at a party last week.
It's like, you're not going to say, what</p>
<p t="3256029" d="3530">do you mean, jealous? That isn't going to
be your question. You're going to say, well</p>
<p t="3259559" d="5141">what were the particular circumstances that
elicited that response? I don't have to</p>
<p t="3264700" d="6010">explain anger, I don't have to explain playfulness,
hunger… you know, all the basic human motivations</p>
<p t="3270710" d="4420">that you see displayed say, in the typical
adventure movie or romantic comedy. It's</p>
<p t="3275130" d="4649">like, those don't need explanation, because
we're the same. And it's that sameness</p>
<p t="3279779" d="4750">that constitutes the essence of the collective
unconscious.</p>
<p t="3284529" d="7660">Now, Jung's hypothesis was that you're
not only biologically structured, you know,</p>
<p t="3292189" d="4201">in terms of your morphology and your physiology,
but that that extends right up into your brain</p>
<p t="3296390" d="5850">structure and even above that, into the contents,
either the contents of your psyche, or at</p>
<p t="3302240" d="7369">least into the way that your psyche becomes
organised across time. And you know, it seems</p>
<p t="3309609" d="3980">like a hypothesis that's so bloody obvious
that you can't believe that people would</p>
<p t="3313589" d="5970">have disputed it for so long, but experimental
psychologists were very strongly influenced</p>
<p t="3319559" d="6411">by behaviourists. And the behaviourists assumed,
partly for ideological reasons, and partly</p>
<p t="3325970" d="5779">for the sake of scientific simplicity, that
human beings were blank slates, and that all</p>
<p t="3331749" d="6750">we were was what we learned.
Well, there's a book out now called ‘Human</p>
<p t="3338499" d="4192">Universals', unfortunately I can't remember
the name of the author right now [Donald Brown]</p>
<p t="3342691" d="7318">but it's a book, it's a work of sociology/anthropology,
and this person has collected human commonalities,</p>
<p t="3350009" d="5760">so what's the same about people everywhere.
Well, we pretty much all wear clothes, sometimes</p>
<p t="3355769" d="5681">for protective purposes, but if not, generally
at least for ceremonial purposes. There's</p>
<p t="3361450" d="4541">pair-bonding in societies, people fall in
love. The basic emotions are the same. We</p>
<p t="3365991" d="5808">use fire, that's a big deal, you know, because
no other animal can manage that. There's</p>
<p t="3371799" d="6881">literally dozens and dozens of universal commonalities
across people, and that's part of the substructure</p>
<p t="3378680" d="7500">of the collective unconscious.
So anyways, back to the creative idea. Well,</p>
<p t="3386180" d="4700">partly your creative act is going to be a
consequence of your attempts to integrate</p>
<p t="3390880" d="8270">the peculiarities of your own experience with
the peculiarities of your culture, and the</p>
<p t="3399150" d="7770">more general phenomena and states of being
that you share with other people. So because</p>
<p t="3406920" d="5599">you come into the world and have your own
viewpoint, you have access to information</p>
<p t="3412519" d="5371">that no other person has access to. And so
to some degree, that can be the basis of your</p>
<p t="3417890" d="5280">creativity, just that information. But then
in order to communicate it, which is also</p>
<p t="3423170" d="4079">part of being creative, right, because you
can't just be… if you're creative but</p>
<p t="3427249" d="4610">no one can understand you, it's more like
you're schizophrenic than you are creative.</p>
<p t="3431859" d="4440">You have loose associations and so forth but
you can't put together a coherent story.</p>
<p t="3436299" d="5091">So then you have to take that unique information
and integrate it with your cultural knowledge,</p>
<p t="3441390" d="4389">your cultural narratives, and ground it in
universal human biology, and then you can</p>
<p t="3445779" d="7940">present that as a creative act.
Now, that's one possible place for the origin</p>
<p t="3453719" d="7701">of new ideas, but here's another. So remember
we talked about Piaget. And Piaget basically</p>
<p t="3461420" d="5769">said that to begin to understand something
you act it out. So you represent the world</p>
<p t="3467189" d="4810">with your body. By sitting on a chair you
represent the chair with your body. By walking</p>
<p t="3471999" d="4510">through a doorway you represent the doorway
through your body. By grabbing a glass you</p>
<p t="3476509" d="4161">do the same thing. So you're matching…
you're imitating the world all the time.</p>
<p t="3480670" d="5379">So you're mapping it onto your physiological
structure. Okay, so that you get a sense,</p>
<p t="3486049" d="4550">that would mean, that's kind of what understanding
means. You know, because that's a complex</p>
<p t="3490599" d="4380">term to sort of understand. What does it mean
to understand something? It means to get a</p>
<p t="3494979" d="6590">grip on it. And you know, we use those terms
for a reason. You know, you're standing</p>
<p t="3501569" d="4950">firmly in relationship to it. You can handle
it. All of those things.</p>
<p t="3506519" d="5190">So that's one… so that's the beginning,
but then also you're capable of imitating,</p>
<p t="3511709" d="4860">so you can imitate yourself, which is what
you do when you repeat experiences that have</p>
<p t="3516569" d="5081">a positive outcome, but you can also imitate
other people. But then you think, okay, well</p>
<p t="3521650" d="7539">who are those people imitating? Well the answer
to that is, it's like we're LED screens,</p>
<p t="3529189" d="7330">and we're constantly rippling imitations
of imitations of imitations of imitations</p>
<p t="3536519" d="6871">across our physiological landscape. I mean,
you guys are the sum total of a very long</p>
<p t="3543390" d="6079">evolutionary process, but you're also the
sum total of an incredibly long process of</p>
<p t="3549469" d="5181">mimicry. And so, what you mimic is your culture.
So you could think of your culture as something</p>
<p t="3554650" d="4389">with a personality. It's a complex personality.
And it's the personality of your ancestors,</p>
<p t="3559039" d="4861">a perfectly reasonable way of looking at that.
And you imitate that. You know, that's why</p>
<p t="3563900" d="6810">we call our laws a ‘body of laws'. And
you could say that the legal system, especially</p>
<p t="3570710" d="6960">with English common law, is the articulated
representation of the imitative customs and</p>
<p t="3577670" d="4760">rituals of the entire society. It's been
brought right up into full articulation. But</p>
<p t="3582430" d="9129">it was there to begin with.
So part of where you draw your material for</p>
<p t="3591559" d="6721">creativity is that you observe the behaviours
and interactions of all people who've been</p>
<p t="3598280" d="4439">imitating all people since the beginning of
time. And that's unbelievably informative.</p>
<p t="3602719" d="4880">It's way more informative than you could
ever represent. You know how much information</p>
<p t="3607599" d="4351">someone can indicate with just lifting your
eyebrow a quarter of an inch, right? That</p>
<p t="3611950" d="3799">can indicate irony, that can indicate the
relationship of the joke to another set of</p>
<p t="3615749" d="4892">jokes that that person knows that you like,
and it's very complicated. You can't articulate</p>
<p t="3620641" d="6039">all that. But in some sense you know it, right,
you're a player in that game. Well now and</p>
<p t="3626680" d="4259">then… so then imagine, okay, you've got
all that embodied, to the degree that you're</p>
<p t="3630939" d="6150">a sophisticated player. Then your imagination
is representing you, and it's representing</p>
<p t="3637089" d="4210">the world. So that's an abstraction, right?
Because your imagination is not the world,</p>
<p t="3641299" d="4871">it's a representation of the world. And
then what you can do… so that means in the</p>
<p t="3646170" d="5490">imagination, there's all sorts of information
that's about the imitated behaviour.</p>
<p t="3651660" d="5179">And then, then you can talk about the image.
That's sort of what you do when you interpret</p>
<p t="3656839" d="4700">a dream. So what's your dream doing? Your
imagination is watching you wander around</p>
<p t="3661539" d="5131">in the world. And you have your category systems
and your theories and so forth. And so then</p>
<p t="3666670" d="6909">your dream puts forth what that… like an
imagistic representation of what that might</p>
<p t="3673579" d="6581">signify. And it's in this weird language,
which is an image-laden language. It can range</p>
<p t="3680160" d="6649">from completely incoherent, just juxtaposed
images, to unbelievable complex and sophisticated</p>
<p t="3686809" d="5530">full-developed narratives. And that's part
of the process by which the information that's</p>
<p t="3692339" d="5380">embedded in you and the culture at a behavioural
level moves up to the imagination and then</p>
<p t="3697719" d="4961">pops up into articulated space. So you have
a dream, the dream is about you. And then</p>
<p t="3702680" d="4059">you talk about the dream, and what you're
doing. You're trying to translate the images</p>
<p t="3706739" d="5911">into articulated representations. And that's
also a good way of thinking about how memory</p>
<p t="3712650" d="6159">moves from the bottom up.
And what's interesting… you know how sometimes</p>
<p t="3718809" d="4450">you have a realisation or a moment of insight?
And that… there's a feeling that goes</p>
<p t="3723259" d="5411">along with that, it's like a charge. And
I think it's a charge that you get from</p>
<p t="3728670" d="5460">simplifying something but also from experiencing
the new possibilities that emerge as a consequence</p>
<p t="3734130" d="6189">of that realisation. What seems to happen
is that you have the behavioural realm, let's</p>
<p t="3740319" d="5030">say, the things you act out, and all the things
you imitate, very, very, complex. And then</p>
<p t="3745349" d="4420">on top of that you have the image of that,
right? And you're trying to get the image</p>
<p t="3749769" d="4030">right but it's really hard because this
changes and this floats around. So you're</p>
<p t="3753799" d="3510">trying to get those lined up, and then on
top of that you're trying to get your articulated</p>
<p t="3757309" d="5500">representations lined up, so that you can
say about what you know about who you are.</p>
<p t="3762809" d="3710">And when all those come together, you think
man, I've got my act together. But now and</p>
<p t="3766519" d="4151">then you'll have an insight, you know, you'll
think… well, like this women who I told</p>
<p t="3770670" d="4970">you about who had been molested. The insight
was well, I was a little kid but so was my</p>
<p t="3775640" d="4859">brother. Bang! It's like, wow, all sorts
of things that didn't make sense anymore</p>
<p t="3780499" d="6171">just fall into place. You get this articulated
representation that can sum up a whole bunch</p>
<p t="3786670" d="6419">of… what would you call them? Divergent
and apparently unrelated image representations.</p>
<p t="3793089" d="3571">And then all of a sudden your path forward
is clearer. Because you know more about who</p>
<p t="3796660" d="4699">you are and you know more about how you…
where you're going.</p>
<p t="3801359" d="3510">And that is in large part what's happening
in psychoanalysis. It's certainly something</p>
<p t="3804869" d="4710">that happens in dream analysis, which is something
that Freud also pioneered. You know, Freud</p>
<p t="3809579" d="7160">believed that dreams were wish fulfillments.
And, you know, he believed that the function</p>
<p t="3816739" d="5570">of dreams about wish fulfillments were to
protect sleep. So for example, maybe you're</p>
<p t="3822309" d="6341">really thirsty, and you go to sleep. And you
dream about drinking water. Some of you who</p>
<p t="3828650" d="5119">have consumed too much beer the night before
might be familiar with those sorts of dreams.</p>
<p t="3833769" d="7450">And so you're dreaming that you're searching
out fountains and you're drinking, and Freud's</p>
<p t="3841219" d="7310">interpretation of that would be, well, you
should stay asleep. And so the dream is providing</p>
<p t="3848529" d="6780">your underlying id-related motivational system,
say the one that governs thirst, with the</p>
<p t="3855309" d="6120">fulfillment of its desire. But I think that's…
I really think that's wrong, although it's</p>
<p t="3861429" d="4860">weird because dreams of course could be doing
all sorts of things. But what seems to happen</p>
<p t="3866289" d="6820">instead… I realised this most particularly
once I heard about a study about the effects</p>
<p t="3873109" d="4460">of testosterone, cycling testosterone on female
sexual activity.</p>
<p t="3877569" d="6800">So the plan is this, is that in women testosterone
levels vary across the monthly cycle, and</p>
<p t="3884369" d="8410">so does sexual desire. And what seems to happen
is that as testosterone increases, the frequency</p>
<p t="3892779" d="7141">of sexual acts doesn't necessarily increase,
but the frequency of sexual fantasy increases.</p>
<p t="3899920" d="5099">And so the hormone is driving the fantasies,
and then the fantasies drive the behaviour,</p>
<p t="3905019" d="5361">it's something like that. And so, the dream
isn't fulfilling a wish, what it's doing</p>
<p t="3910380" d="6880">is… that's how the motivational system
manifests itself in a plan for action. It's</p>
<p t="3917260" d="4799">like well you should be going to look for
sources of water, if you're thirsty. And</p>
<p t="3922059" d="5081">so, because the… you know the hypothalamus
has to communicate with you somehow. It doesn't</p>
<p t="3927140" d="5869">just grip your behaviour and move you around
like a robot. You know, it has to indicate</p>
<p t="3933009" d="5471">what the state, what your state is, it does
that all sorts of ways, and then start tilting</p>
<p t="3938480" d="3749">you towards solutions, using your memories
and your skills and everything that would</p>
<p t="3942229" d="6570">be related to successful outcomes of that
form in the past.</p>
<p t="3948799" d="3871">The other thing I should say about creativity,
and this is I think something very useful</p>
<p t="3952670" d="5339">for understanding people's reactions to
psychoanalysis. I have a lot of creative people</p>
<p t="3958009" d="5250">in my clientele, for a variety of reasons,
and some who aren't creative. And creativity</p>
<p t="3963259" d="6840">is a trait. And most people aren't creative.
It's not common. And some people who are</p>
<p t="3970099" d="7590">creative are so creative it's just absolutely
beyond comprehension. So Picasso for example,</p>
<p t="3977689" d="11001">created 65,000 works of art, three a day for
65 years. Now that guy was creative. So anyways,</p>
<p t="3988690" d="3960">lots of people aren't creative, and they're
not interested in psychoanalytic ideas, they're</p>
<p t="3992650" d="3619">not interested in archetypal ideas, they're
not really gripped by narrative. So if you</p>
<p t="3996269" d="5500">happen to be… one marker for creativity
by the way, for openness, is really liking</p>
<p t="4001769" d="6660">fiction. And women actually like fiction more
than men, because women are actually slightly</p>
<p t="4008429" d="6500">higher in part of openness than men are.
So what else… if you like poetry, you know,</p>
<p t="4014929" d="5770">and it gives you an aesthetic experience,
if you really get deeply involved in music,</p>
<p t="4020699" d="5580">if you're able to produce things that are
creative. If you have the kind of mind that</p>
<p t="4026279" d="6090">works in associations. So for example, if
I told you guys alright, write down as many</p>
<p t="4032369" d="4651">words as you can in the next three minutes
that begin with the letter L. Those of you</p>
<p t="4037020" d="4459">who are more creative would come up with more
words. So there's a verbal fluency component.</p>
<p t="4041479" d="6820">I could say, okay, how many uses can you think
of for a brick? And then I would score that.</p>
<p t="4048299" d="4680">The first would be how many uses you came
up with, that would be the sheer number, I'd</p>
<p t="4052979" d="5100">throw away the stupid ones that make no sense,
and often you have to get a panel of people</p>
<p t="4058079" d="5910">to make that judgment, right. You know, you
could say “well, you could use it as a thing”.</p>
<p t="4063989" d="6210">It's like no, X, you don't get a score
for that. So then, you get another score for</p>
<p t="4070199" d="6100">how uncommon your response was. And that's
an originality dimension. And actually if</p>
<p t="4076299" d="5881">you calculate those two dimensions, fluency
and originality, from a divergent thinking</p>
<p t="4082180" d="4419">task, which is the one I just told you about,
you can predict how creative people are quite</p>
<p t="4086599" d="3470">well.
Anyways, the really creative people seem to</p>
<p t="4090069" d="4530">have a deep well-spring of unconscious ideas
that are always flowing forth, and some of</p>
<p t="4094599" d="5151">those people dream like mad. And they have
extremely sophisticated and complex dreams,</p>
<p t="4099750" d="6930">and those dreams seem to guide their behaviour.
And that's quite entertaining when you see</p>
<p t="4106680" d="4040">that in psychotherapy if you have an interest
in such things. And you might say well, how</p>
<p t="4110720" d="5030">do you know if your dream interpretation is
true? And the answer to that is, well how</p>
<p t="4115750" d="6830">do you know if how you interpreted the last
book you read is true? And the answer to that</p>
<p t="4122580" d="5120">is, you don't, and even if you did, you
don't know how you know it. Because lots</p>
<p t="4127700" d="3860">of people can read a book and they come away
with slightly different interpretations of</p>
<p t="4131560" d="5290">it. And that's because, you can imagine
that the book is a multi-level pattern. And</p>
<p t="4136850" d="4090">then the reader is a multi-level pattern.
And then if you put those two together, you</p>
<p t="4140940" d="4250">get a multi-level pattern that's made out
of the reader and the book, and that's going</p>
<p t="4145190" d="5210">to be unique for every single reader. Except
that we have commonalities of structure so</p>
<p t="4150400" d="4851">that we can communicate about it.
So you read a book and it strikes you, certain</p>
<p t="4155251" d="3419">things strike you and certain things seem
right. If you do a dream interpretation, it's</p>
<p t="4158670" d="5399">a collaboration between you and the client
about the interpretation. So usually what</p>
<p t="4164069" d="6531">I do is I have people, first of all they'll
tell me their dream, from beginning to end.</p>
<p t="4170600" d="4900">Now Freud would say, already you're introducing
all sorts of bias, because they're not telling</p>
<p t="4175500" d="4859">you the dream, they're telling you the dream
as they interpret and remember it. It's</p>
<p t="4180359" d="4391">like yeah, that's a problem. But you do
what you can, you know? And I tell people</p>
<p t="4184750" d="3780">just write it down as fast you can and try
not to think about it too much, because we</p>
<p t="4188530" d="5760">don't want post-dream editing. And so then
I'll listen to it, and then they'll tell</p>
<p t="4194290" d="5330">it to me again, slowly. And then I'll listen
to a sentence and then I'll let my associational</p>
<p t="4199620" d="5280">network work on it, and then see what that
reminds me of, and then I'll ask the person</p>
<p t="4204900" d="4810">what it reminds them of. And then we'll
talk about… those are the direct associations,</p>
<p t="4209710" d="4210">those are the things Freud would call ‘free
associations'. And you could say, well,</p>
<p t="4213920" d="5460">around every utterance, like a sentence, there's
a collection of potential meanings, right?</p>
<p t="4219380" d="4950">And those meanings might be direct meanings,
like really tightly associated with it, to</p>
<p t="4224330" d="5700">sort of loose meanings. And so you can hit
back and forth with client and therapist,</p>
<p t="4230030" d="4590">until you think, oh yeah, okay, that seems
to be where that's going. And you're also</p>
<p t="4234620" d="4860">thinking about it in relationship to the person's
current life experiences and the rest of the</p>
<p t="4239480" d="4980">dream and maybe all the dreams they told you
about before. So it's insanely complicated.</p>
<p t="4244460" d="4190">But it's what people do when they listen
to a conversation. You know, how do you know</p>
<p t="4248650" d="7090">you're interpretation of a conversation
is true? Well, you know, there's a variety</p>
<p t="4255740" d="4630">of ways that you can approximate that, but
you don't know. And there's lots of different</p>
<p t="4260370" d="4730">ways of interpreting a conversation. That's
why the post-modernists ended up in their</p>
<p t="4265100" d="4710">little hole with regards to literature. They
realised that there's no limit to the number</p>
<p t="4269810" d="5020">of ways you can interpret a book. But then
they took the next step which was that therefore</p>
<p t="4274830" d="7310">it has no meaning. It's like no no no, wrong,
wrong. It's very unsophisticated thinking.</p>
<p t="4282140" d="5800">It just means that the way the book portrays
meaning is exceedingly complex, and you can't</p>
<p t="4287940" d="4760">describe it using normal, linear rationality.
It doesn't mean the meaning isn't there.</p>
<p t="4292700" d="4950">That's so pathetic. That's such a pathetic
theory. It's dangerous too because it means</p>
<p t="4297650" d="4480">that nothing has any meaning and that's
the most dangerous theory, that.</p>
<p t="4302130" d="5580">So anyways, you talk to the person about the
dream and the dream image and about what that</p>
<p t="4307710" d="6310">triggers off in their memory, and you also
watch what they say, because sometimes…</p>
<p t="4314020" d="4740">so for example, someone (this just happened
recently) might be describing a dream where</p>
<p t="4318760" d="4190">they, where they're wandering around somewhere,
and they'll say “and I'm taking the</p>
<p t="4322950" d="3830">wrong road”. You think oh, okay! Well now
we know what your dream meant because you</p>
<p t="4326780" d="5250">just said it. I'm taking the wrong road.
And that's a Freudian slip, and it's so</p>
<p t="4332030" d="4070">interesting, because if you listen to people
tell their dreams, you have to kind of listen…</p>
<p t="4336100" d="5200">it's like they have two minds talking at
the same time. And one is describing the dream,</p>
<p t="4341300" d="3960">but the other one is describing their life,
and they don't even notice the connection,</p>
<p t="4345260" d="3770">and you point it out and they go oh yeah!
Right, right I didn't know I said that.</p>
<p t="4349030" d="4510">And that's a Freudian slip. And I think
what's happening, in part, is the right</p>
<p t="4353540" d="6670">hemisphere, which is an image accumulation
and aggregation system, it's kind of a low-resolution</p>
<p t="4360210" d="4950">pattern collection system, uses mostly images.
And tries to put them together in meaningful</p>
<p t="4365160" d="6110">ways, but the meaning is vague and comprehensive.
And then the left hemisphere, roughly speaking,</p>
<p t="4371270" d="5230">which is the linguistic hemisphere, is trying
to state what that says in words. And it's</p>
<p t="4376500" d="5290">very difficult to make that transformation,
but that's why dream analysis works in part.</p>
<p t="4381790" d="4910">It's because you're facilitating the movement
of the information in the images into the</p>
<p t="4386700" d="5680">articulated part of the personality. You're
moving information up the abstraction hierarchy</p>
<p t="4392380" d="6390">to the point where it can be well utilised.
Now, I'll end this with… I'll end this</p>
<p t="4398770" d="7070">discussion of Freud with a description of
some research that was done recently by…</p>
<p t="4405840" d="6130">relatively recently, let's say the last
20 years, by this psychologist at the University</p>
<p t="4411970" d="6480">of Texas at Austin, whose name is James Pennebaker.
And Pennebaker is a particularly smart psychologist.</p>
<p t="4418450" d="4860">And he had this idea… Freud had another
idea that was related to therapy, and he thought</p>
<p t="4423310" d="3632">that what happened, if you came into therapy
and you talked about a traumatic event, was</p>
<p t="4426942" d="6908">that you were cured by catharsis, which meant
that the trauma had a bunch of emotion associated</p>
<p t="4433850" d="3830">with it, and that was repressed but it was
down there kind of struggling to get out,</p>
<p t="4437680" d="3761">and causing you all sorts of stress and misery
trying to hold it down. And then if you could</p>
<p t="4441441" d="6149">just tell someone about it, and express your
feelings, then that would help you. Expressing</p>
<p t="4447590" d="5950">your feelings does not help you, by the way.
That turns out to be wrong, but it turns out</p>
<p t="4453540" d="4250">to be wrong in an interesting and useful way.
Because it's sort of… it's almost right.</p>
<p t="4457790" d="6230">So what Pennebaker did was he took undergraduates
and he had them come in to the lab for three</p>
<p t="4464020" d="5470">consequential days, and he had them write
for fifteen minutes each day about the worst</p>
<p t="4469490" d="3451">thing that they had ever done or the worst
thing that had ever happened to them. Often</p>
<p t="4472941" d="4789">people are traumatised by something they did,
not something that happened to them. In fact,</p>
<p t="4477730" d="4410">more often, because someone watches themselves
do something absolutely horrific, and then</p>
<p t="4482140" d="5510">they think, ‘oh my God! I did that! Who
am I?” They don't know, and then that's…</p>
<p t="4487650" d="5670">you know, things start coming unglued.
So anyways, Pennebaker had them do that, and</p>
<p t="4493320" d="3380">then for the next two weeks they felt pretty
wretched about it. And so, that's interesting,</p>
<p t="4496700" d="4560">because if they would have only measured the
result of the intervention in the two week</p>
<p t="4501260" d="4590">time-span, everyone would have said never
write down your traumatic experiences because</p>
<p t="4505850" d="5250">it'll make you worse. But over the next
six months, what happened in particular was</p>
<p t="4511100" d="4230">that their physical health improved. They
went to the doctor less, they reported less</p>
<p t="4515330" d="3850">illness, and so forth. And it's because
their overall level of stress decreased, for</p>
<p t="4519180" d="5570">complex reasons that we could talk about later.
But then Pennebaker, being an excellent scientist,</p>
<p t="4524750" d="5220">he thought okay, well catharsis works, you're
expressing your trauma and poof! You're</p>
<p t="4529970" d="5150">fixed. But he went back and he thought, well
wait a second. Maybe how you express it matters.</p>
<p t="4535120" d="4010">So he went back and he counted all the words
that were associated with emotion, and all</p>
<p t="4539130" d="5550">the words that were associated with understanding
and cognition. And what he found was two things:</p>
<p t="4544680" d="6300">one was the more words that you use, particularly
as your narrative developed, that indicated</p>
<p t="4550980" d="4830">comprehension and understanding, the better
you did over time.</p>
<p t="4555810" d="5650">And so what happens is, it's not the expressing
of your emotion, it's the expressing of</p>
<p t="4561460" d="8480">your emotion and then the weaving of the memory
into a new coherent representation from which</p>
<p t="4569940" d="5810">you derive a moral. So what's the moral
of a trauma? Don't let it happen again.</p>
<p t="4575750" d="4870">That's the moral. And the threat systems
are going to be throwing that thing up at</p>
<p t="4580620" d="5100">you constantly until you figure it out. How
did I get into this, how do I avoid it in</p>
<p t="4585720" d="3670">the future? That doesn't mean it's your
fault, but your anxiety systems, they don't</p>
<p t="4589390" d="4650">care about that. They care about how you're
not going to fall into the same hole. And</p>
<p t="4594040" d="3720">the only way to do that is to analyse the
causal pathways that led to the hole to begin</p>
<p t="4597760" d="4930">with, and see if you can either reconfigure
your behaviour and your attitude, so that</p>
<p t="4602690" d="6520">doesn't happen again, or maybe you just
don't go those places anymore. Either way.</p>
<p t="4609210" d="7430">And your… the trauma threat systems, as
soon as you come up with a comprehensive representation</p>
<p t="4616640" d="4960">that you believe in, they'll leave you alone.
And this can happen very, very rapidly. Like</p>
<p t="4621600" d="3980">with nightmares, I've cured people's nightmares
in one session, no problem.</p>
<p t="4625580" d="7100">I ask them to bring the nightmare up into
their imagination. Maybe someone's chasing</p>
<p t="4632680" d="5720">them. Okay, think about them chasing you.
You've got to visualise it, really visualise</p>
<p t="4638400" d="3620">it. The more real you make it, the better.
Okay, they're being chased. How are you</p>
<p t="4642020" d="5290">feeling? “I'm all anxious and afraid”.
Okay, turn around and look at the thing that's</p>
<p t="4647310" d="4790">chasing you. So they do that. Then maybe they
say what it is or whatever, but maybe they</p>
<p t="4652100" d="4440">don't even do that. And then I say okay,
before you go to bed at night, just when you're</p>
<p t="4656540" d="4170">almost falling to sleep, you're in a hypnogogic
state, where images are starting to come,</p>
<p t="4660710" d="4690">you run that. So they run that, poof! That
nightmare's gone. And the reason for it</p>
<p t="4665400" d="5470">is that they've now reconfigured themselves
as the thing, not the thing that's being</p>
<p t="4670870" d="4740">chased, that's a prey animal, they've
configured themselves as the thing that can</p>
<p t="4675610" d="6820">turn around and face the thing that's chasing
them. And that's the same motif as the dragon</p>
<p t="4682430" d="4340">hunt in the Jungian archetypes, right? Face
what you're afraid of and that will cure</p>
<p t="4686770" d="5060">you. And that's really one of the fundamental
motifs of Freudian psychoanalysis.</p>
<p t="4691830" d="6880">So, you know you have an exam on Thursday.
I'll post representative questions of the</p>
<p t="4698710" d="7920">exam when I get home after this lecture, probably
this evening. The test is here, it's multiple</p>
<p t="4706630" d="3830">choice, you'll have no problem finishing
it, it's not that long. And if you've</p>
<p t="4710460" d="5760">done the readings and come to the lectures,
you'll probably do fine. It's not a tricky</p>
<p t="4716220" d="480">test.</p>
