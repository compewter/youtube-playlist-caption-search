<p t="0" d="4400">Okay, so we divided up the brain one way.</p>
<p t="4400" d="4470">Now we're going to divide it up another
way, so this is the brain from the top down.</p>
<p t="8870" d="3729">You know you have two hemispheres and you
might think, “well why do you need two hemispheres?”</p>
<p t="12599" d="9601">Do know that Gazzaniga, who's a relatively
famous neuropsychologist, studied split-brain</p>
<p t="22200" d="1000">patients.</p>
<p t="23200" d="4550">You know that your cortical hemispheres – your
brain is united down in the sub-cortical areas.</p>
<p t="27750" d="7670">It's sort of stuck together, although you
have twins of many of the sub-cortical structures.</p>
<p t="35420" d="5630">You have two hippoc8ampi and two amygdala
for example – one on each side.</p>
<p t="41050" d="5800">At the top, the hemispheres are quite separate,
but they're connected by the corpus callosum,</p>
<p t="46850" d="1000">which makes them communicate.</p>
<p t="47850" d="4709">It's kind of interesting because you wonder
why they aren't all glued together.</p>
<p t="52559" d="5311">What it seems to indicate is that there's
some utility of functional independence, combined</p>
<p t="57870" d="2470">with some utility of communication.</p>
<p t="60340" d="3899">So it might be like, “do you really want
to be networked at the same time to everyone</p>
<p t="64239" d="1000">in the world?”</p>
<p t="65239" d="6170">No you don't, you want some narrow pathway
so that only the important information comes</p>
<p t="71409" d="1000">through.</p>
<p t="72409" d="3621">So it's sort of like, maybe the right hemisphere's
the one kind of computational device, and</p>
<p t="76030" d="3760">the left hemisphere is another kind of computational
device – of course they're not computational</p>
<p t="79790" d="2070">devices, but you get the point.</p>
<p t="81860" d="4140">Only the important information – the processed
information from the right hemisphere goes</p>
<p t="86000" d="1000">across.</p>
<p t="87000" d="3270">And only the processed information from the
left hemisphere goes across.</p>
<p t="90270" d="1419">Something like that, whatever.</p>
<p t="91689" d="7831">If you have someone who's epileptic or that
has a brain illness of some sort, it's usually</p>
<p t="99520" d="5919">epilepsy but not always, and you do surgery
on them and cut the corpus callosum; what</p>
<p t="105439" d="5391">you find, weirdly enough, is that each hemisphere
develops its own personality.</p>
<p t="110830" d="5820">This is other evidence, I would say, for the
idea that what the brain does is produce personalities.</p>
<p t="116650" d="4230">You can keep paring the brain down, and what
it's going to do is produce lower and lower</p>
<p t="120880" d="6000">resolution personalities all the way down
to the bottom – they're just not as detailed.</p>
<p t="126880" d="4180">If you lost, say eighty percent of your cortex
randomly, you'd sort of being like a thumbnail</p>
<p t="131060" d="1000">of yourself.</p>
<p t="132060" d="5120">So, you'd still be you, just not at the
same detail.</p>
<p t="137180" d="6330">Here's an interesting idea from the Catholics,
it kind of goes along with the avatar idea.</p>
<p t="143510" d="4610">So the Catholics had been wrestling for a
long time with the question of how God could</p>
<p t="148120" d="4009">have fit himself in a human body– because
you could imagine that could obsess Christians</p>
<p t="152129" d="5931">– this great, big God in an itty-bitty body,
but God in there just bursts the boundaries.</p>
<p t="158060" d="3880">They have this idea called Kenosis, which
means emptying.</p>
<p t="161940" d="5269">The idea is that God had to empty himself
out before he could inhabit a human body,</p>
<p t="167209" d="2621">and it's very much like a thumbnail idea.</p>
<p t="169830" d="5480">Jung would have of course thought exactly,
that the self was a thumbnail of God.</p>
<p t="175310" d="5570">He wouldn't put it that way, but definitely
that's where his thinking was leading.</p>
<p t="180880" d="3770">So that's a pretty damn cool idea.</p>
<p t="184650" d="7820">Anyways, so I developed this before I read
what I'm going to tell you, but it doesn't</p>
<p t="192470" d="1000">matter.</p>
<p t="193470" d="3510">I'm going to talk about it from another
theorist's point of view.</p>
<p t="196980" d="2750">The guy I'm going to tell you about, his
name is Elkhonon Goldberg.</p>
<p t="199730" d="4929">He's a neuropsychologist, and he was one
of Luria's students who ended up in New</p>
<p t="204659" d="1061">York.</p>
<p t="205720" d="5360">Goldberg was obviously influenced by Luria
and all the unknown, Grey, and all those people</p>
<p t="211080" d="2219">that I've already talked to you about.</p>
<p t="213299" d="2151">He was interested in why you have two hemispheres.</p>
<p t="215450" d="4910">Well, there's a bunch of things you can
say, broadly speaking about the hemispheres,</p>
<p t="220360" d="2070">and I've written some of them down there.</p>
<p t="222430" d="5520">The right hemisphere – this is an idealized
representation of a relatively highly lateralized</p>
<p t="227950" d="2380">right-handed male.</p>
<p t="230330" d="4850">The reason I'm saying that is men seem to
be more lateralized than women, and the right-handed</p>
<p t="235180" d="4020">lateralization is the standard kind.</p>
<p t="239200" d="2340">The brain can be lateralized all sorts of
ways.</p>
<p t="241540" d="4660">What you might say is that – there's a
bunch of ways of looking at it.</p>
<p t="246200" d="6200">One way you can look at it is that your cortex
gets colonized by underlying structures.</p>
<p t="252400" d="6480">Each underlying structure is likely to colonize
a particular area.</p>
<p t="258880" d="6349">For example, when you are born and you wake
up and you see, your eyes are going to colonize</p>
<p t="265229" d="1981">your visual cortex most likely.</p>
<p t="267210" d="1769">It's sort of adapted for that.</p>
<p t="268979" d="5690">If you don't have a visual cortex then your
eyes will colonize something else.</p>
<p t="274669" d="7091">So the brain has proclivities towards a certain
kind of structure, especially early in development,</p>
<p t="281760" d="4760">it's unbelievably plastic, and so brains
can be organized and lateralized in a bunch</p>
<p t="286520" d="2390">of different ways.</p>
<p t="288910" d="5940">To simplify it, what you do is you kind of
take, well let's take the most straight-forward</p>
<p t="294850" d="3960">and typical brain and talk about it as if
it's the canonical brain.</p>
<p t="298810" d="5220">I think what you can say is, regardless of
where these systems are localized, they exist.</p>
<p t="304030" d="4370">So it's an oversimplification – whatever,
doesn't matter.</p>
<p t="308400" d="4480">What you've got with regards to your cortices
is a quick and dirty cortex, that's the</p>
<p t="312880" d="3940">right hemisphere, and then you've got a
long-term detailed cortex and that's the</p>
<p t="316820" d="1000">left hemisphere.</p>
<p t="317820" d="2930">The left hemisphere is specialized for language.</p>
<p t="320750" d="3770">Language cuts things up into little, tiny,
bitty pieces.</p>
<p t="324520" d="4230">That's really useful if you're doing little,
tiny, bitty things.</p>
<p t="328750" d="2290">You should be – precision, right?</p>
<p t="331040" d="3590">Pinpoint accuracy; but that takes a lot of
time and a lot of computation.</p>
<p t="334630" d="3740">Whereas the right hemisphere says, “yeah,
yeah, let's get to the bloody point.”</p>
<p t="338370" d="3109">So it captures the thing in an image.</p>
<p t="341479" d="3591">So like the monster I showed you from the
hippie cartoon, that's a right hemisphere</p>
<p t="345070" d="1000">thing.</p>
<p t="346070" d="5950">It's an image that represents a class of
entities; which, of course, images do.</p>
<p t="352020" d="8470">There's this woman named - can't remember
- autistic woman.</p>
<p t="360490" d="4060">She's developed paddle-handling facilities
all across –</p>
<p t="364550" d="1060">“what's her name?”</p>
<p t="365610" d="1070">Student “Temple Grandin.”</p>
<p t="366680" d="1769">Temple Grandin, yes a very cool person.</p>
<p t="368449" d="4871">Yes I saw Temple Grandin speak at the University
of Arizona at the Consciousness Conference,</p>
<p t="373320" d="3249">and it was the funniest speech I've ever
seen in my life.</p>
<p t="376569" d="2421">Not because it wasn't perfect – it was
bloody perfect.</p>
<p t="378990" d="4730">She's a tough woman – she looks a like
a cowboy, and she spent a lot of time with</p>
<p t="383720" d="1000">animals.</p>
<p t="384720" d="4610">She comes out on the stage in her cowboy outfit
and she's unbelievably straightforward and</p>
<p t="389330" d="4360">without nuance – she's autistic, she's
severely autistic.</p>
<p t="393690" d="4110">You know, her mother helped her a lot, she
developed this thing that she would go inside</p>
<p t="397800" d="4500">to compress her and hold her – like a little
machine and that would comfort her.</p>
<p t="402300" d="5369">Anyways, she turned herself into quite the
person and she thinks, she thinks like an</p>
<p t="407669" d="1000">animal.</p>
<p t="408669" d="4451">This is why she can design cattle handling
facilities, which are often slaughter houses,</p>
<p t="413120" d="3480">so that the cattle don't get all freaked
out as they're on their way to their eventual</p>
<p t="416600" d="1060">demise.</p>
<p t="417660" d="3890">So one of the things she does, is she walks
through where the cattle are going, and anything</p>
<p t="421550" d="3450">that bothers her, she assumes will bother
a cow.</p>
<p t="425000" d="5180">So for example, if the cows are walking through
this spiral as they're on their way to the</p>
<p t="430180" d="4280">slaughter-house and there's a coke can lying
on the ground, all the cows will stop and</p>
<p t="434460" d="2980">look at the coke can – it's anomalous.</p>
<p t="437440" d="6159">Now, she talked a lot about how she thought
and what she said was that she could not devise</p>
<p t="443599" d="2511">abstract representations.</p>
<p t="446110" d="5750">So she said, okay, imagine how a child draws
a house.</p>
<p t="451860" d="1000">What is in that child's house?</p>
<p t="452860" d="6740">There's a triangle and a square on the left,
and then there's another rectangle, and</p>
<p t="459600" d="4350">another parallelogram, and there's a door
and two windows, right?</p>
<p t="463950" d="3790">Then there's a chimney with smoke coming
out – which is quite cool, it's like why</p>
<p t="467740" d="1000">is that?</p>
<p t="468740" d="1000">Where's the smoke?</p>
<p t="469740" d="2080">You don't see that in modern houses, but
kids still do that.</p>
<p t="471820" d="6099">And then there's a tree, and usually there's
a sun, and then - house.</p>
<p t="477919" d="2611">You think, oh, isn't that cute, a simple
drawing.</p>
<p t="480530" d="1590">That drawing is not simple.</p>
<p t="482120" d="3150">You've never seen a house that looks like
that in your life.</p>
<p t="485270" d="1970">It looks nothing like a house.</p>
<p t="487240" d="3400">It's not a house, it's not a picture,
it's a hieroglyph.</p>
<p t="490640" d="2369">It's a pre-linguistic representation.</p>
<p t="493009" d="3711">It's like the essential elements of “house.”</p>
<p t="496720" d="4550">So you might say what the child has done is
extracted out all those things that are common</p>
<p t="501270" d="3140">across all houses, and then represented that.</p>
<p t="504410" d="1550">It's not a drawing.</p>
<p t="505960" d="4121">Now if you take autistic people, sometimes,
and you get them to draw, they'll start</p>
<p t="510081" d="5518">in one corner of the house, and what they'll
draw is that house – with every damn brick</p>
<p t="515599" d="1261">in place.</p>
<p t="516860" d="4549">So there are autistic people, for example,
who – they can look at a building and they</p>
<p t="521409" d="2171">can count every single window at one glance.</p>
<p t="523580" d="4720">Then, there's another guy in England who's
really famous, and this guy is unbelievable.</p>
<p t="528300" d="5060">You take him up in a helicopter and show him
a city that he's never seen, then he goes</p>
<p t="533360" d="3990">home and has a piece of paper, like as big
as a wall, and he starts in one corner and</p>
<p t="537350" d="1820">he draws the entire city.</p>
<p t="539170" d="4450">He doesn't sketch it out – it's from
the bottom up.</p>
<p t="543620" d="2580">That's autistic savant drawing.</p>
<p t="546200" d="3240">Often what happens is, it's very realistic
looking.</p>
<p t="549440" d="5040">What happens if the autistic drawings of blank
language is they stop being able to draw.</p>
<p t="554480" d="5030">That's because the abstraction interferes
with the realism.</p>
<p t="559510" d="3420">It's really hard to draw a hand.</p>
<p t="562930" d="3960">The reason for that is if you draw a hand,
you draw a hieroglyph of hand.</p>
<p t="566890" d="1810">This is what a hand looks like.</p>
<p t="568700" d="2829">You try to draw your hand and it's really
strange.</p>
<p t="571529" d="4021">One of the really strange things about trying
to draw your hand is that in order to draw</p>
<p t="575550" d="4010">it, you have to stop seeing it as if it's
a hand.</p>
<p t="579560" d="2910">Then it pops out and you think, my God, that's
the weirdest looking thing.</p>
<p t="582470" d="4130">It's like a tree root, you know, it's
like a claw.</p>
<p t="586600" d="3470">You know if you look at your hand like that,
it looks nothing like a hand.</p>
<p t="590070" d="2230">That's how a hand looks.</p>
<p t="592300" d="1000">What the hell's that?</p>
<p t="593300" d="5280">It's like some sort of spider, but you have
to see it that way before you can draw it.</p>
<p t="598580" d="6699">So partly what happens is, is that your capacity
for abstraction interferes with your ability</p>
<p t="605279" d="4191">to see detail, that's probably good – it's
one of the ways that you simplify the world.</p>
<p t="609470" d="5920">Anyways, the right hemisphere looks like it's
specialized for anomaly.</p>
<p t="615390" d="4230">The way I look at it is this: Okay, so you've
got your hippocampus down there, and it's</p>
<p t="619620" d="4260">keeping track of the comparison between what
you want and what you think is happening.</p>
<p t="623880" d="1000">“Bang!”</p>
<p t="624880" d="1130">Something emerges, and it's anomalous.</p>
<p t="626010" d="1710">You don't know what the hell's going on.</p>
<p t="627720" d="3530">So you freeze, that's the notoric representation.</p>
<p t="631250" d="1940">Then you start to feel anxious.</p>
<p t="633190" d="4310">Then the right hemisphere comes up with some
pictures – what might this be?</p>
<p t="637500" d="2820">You can experience this at home, for your
own enjoyment.</p>
<p t="640320" d="4130">Let's say you're home at two in the morning,
it's dark and you're alone.</p>
<p t="644450" d="2930">Maybe you've watched a horror movie, so
you're all nicely blank.</p>
<p t="647380" d="3980">You know and then you hear a noise in another
room and that noise shouldn't be there.</p>
<p t="651360" d="2289">So you're going to go investigate, right?</p>
<p t="653649" d="2931">So let's say the door's just a little
bit open, and it's dark in the room, and</p>
<p t="656580" d="3230">you have to put your hand in to turn on the
light.</p>
<p t="659810" d="5130">You just watch what your imagination populates
that room with when you do that.</p>
<p t="664940" d="3180">You know, it's like – guy with axe, snake,
alligator, like whatever!</p>
<p t="668120" d="6640">You're right hemisphere is going: there
may be one of this class of dangerous thing</p>
<p t="674760" d="1000">in there.</p>
<p t="675760" d="3660">What it's doing is it's basically coming
up with a hypothesis: what sort of monster</p>
<p t="679420" d="1000">might be in there.</p>
<p t="680420" d="5000">You're all freaked out about that, even
though you know – who knows what happened;</p>
<p t="685420" d="4331">nothing but something creaked, but you're
all on edge because your brain doesn't work</p>
<p t="689751" d="2059">at night like it does during the day.</p>
<p t="691810" d="5380">Everyone knows that – wake up in the middle
of the night, a manner of horrors go through</p>
<p t="697190" d="2800">your imagination, and that usually happens
when you're asleep.</p>
<p t="699990" d="4560">You're asleep for that most of the time,
but sometimes you wake up and you worry about</p>
<p t="704550" d="1000">everything.</p>
<p t="705550" d="4440">Anyways, so that's the right hemisphere
– it's coming up with pictures of what</p>
<p t="709990" d="1270">might be there.</p>
<p t="711260" d="4579">They're generally monstrous pictures and
the reason for that is, well it's obvious,</p>
<p t="715839" d="2041">what the reason for that is.</p>
<p t="717880" d="3600">You'll probably turn the light on and look
anyways, even though you might sort of peer</p>
<p t="721480" d="2740">around the corner, and then when there's
nothing you'll be embarrassed about how</p>
<p t="724220" d="1790">foolish you are.</p>
<p t="726010" d="4600">But you can see the instinctual behavior right
there, and it's wise.</p>
<p t="730610" d="4580">You know, there's a low probability that
something terrible is there.</p>
<p t="735190" d="6089">Low probability times infinitely equals large
danger.</p>
<p t="741279" d="5000">So if there's a two percent chance that
there's a killer in there, it pays to be</p>
<p t="746279" d="3041">a little on the tense side, because being
killed really sucks.</p>
<p t="749320" d="5870">So you're primed to feel negative emotion
more intensely, because you're so vulnerable.</p>
<p t="755190" d="4840">Anyways, that's kind of what the right hemisphere
is up to – it does quick and dirty representations.</p>
<p t="760030" d="6640">It also does categorization, so it's not
– it doesn't give you exactly realistic</p>
<p t="766670" d="1669">representations of what's there.</p>
<p t="768339" d="3831">What it does instead, is it gives you categorical
representations.</p>
<p t="772170" d="3550">So you might say, “how should you represent
an unknown danger?”</p>
<p t="775720" d="5840">You should use an amalgam of all known dangers
to represent it.</p>
<p t="781560" d="2269">That is what it is in a sense, you know?</p>
<p t="783829" d="4401">That's why I talked to you about the category
of “all dangerous things.”</p>
<p t="788230" d="7020">So the Aboriginals in Australia have this
category which is, “women, fire, and dangerous</p>
<p t="795250" d="1000">things.”</p>
<p t="796250" d="3820">Well you think, well why are all of those
things in that category?</p>
<p t="800070" d="3600">It's not that hard to figure out if you
think about it, but it's also a category</p>
<p t="803670" d="3330">that you very frequently see, say in Disney
cartoons.</p>
<p t="807000" d="4630">So the Wicked Queen, for example, in Sleeping
Beauty – she's constantly bursting into</p>
<p t="811630" d="3980">flames and turning into a dragon and no one
seems to object to that – it makes perfect</p>
<p t="815610" d="2919">sense that the Wicked Queen would turn into
a fire-breathing dragon.</p>
<p t="818529" d="6300">It doesn't make any sense at all, although
it does, but it's not a rational transformation.</p>
<p t="824829" d="4651">But because it's in keeping with an archetypal
structure, everybody goes, “yeah, of course</p>
<p t="829480" d="1000">that's what she's going to do.”</p>
<p t="830480" d="5140">It happens all of the time in Disney movies
– like Ursula, remember her from the Little</p>
<p t="835620" d="1000">Mermaid?</p>
<p t="836620" d="2150">She's trying to keep her daughter from becoming
conscious.</p>
<p t="838770" d="2800">Yeah, nice Mother doing that.</p>
<p t="841570" d="5000">She traps old Zeus – she squeezes his soul
to death and traps him in the underworld.</p>
<p t="846570" d="4200">He's also – well, we won't get into
that.</p>
<p t="850770" d="3230">Anyways, what happens to Ursula is when you
finally get her irritated enough she grows</p>
<p t="854000" d="7220">into this huge, ship-destroying, storm monster
that's part octopus – a giant octopus.</p>
<p t="861220" d="2630">You think, “well, that makes sense.”</p>
<p t="863850" d="4690">Okay, it doesn't make a lot of sense, but
it's a kind of hypothesis.</p>
<p t="868540" d="4789">Now that's a representation of Mother Nature
– red and tooth and claw, and there's</p>
<p t="873329" d="3940">also a reason that's female – it's not
female, it's feminine – it's actually</p>
<p t="877269" d="1341">a different thing.</p>
<p t="878610" d="1950">We'll get to that.</p>
<p t="880560" d="5089">So the right hemisphere, well it's specialized
for anomaly – it does quick and dirt analysis</p>
<p t="885649" d="1931">under the influence of the limbic system.</p>
<p t="887580" d="4449">It's not linguistic, so I would say that
it's still dominated by the sub-cortical</p>
<p t="892029" d="1000">systems.</p>
<p t="893029" d="4291">My suspicion is that animals are still dominated
by the sub-cortical systems.</p>
<p t="897320" d="2190">Their brains work from the bottom up.</p>
<p t="899510" d="1889">We have a top down module.</p>
<p t="901399" d="3321">That's at least in part of the left hemisphere
linguistic system.</p>
<p t="904720" d="4940">It's a new thing that people have, and it's
based on our capacity to abstract, so that</p>
<p t="909660" d="5020">would partly be visual, like hieroglyphic,
and then also to transform things into linguistic</p>
<p t="914680" d="1000">form.</p>
<p t="915680" d="4070">It seems to me that that's the part that
we really identify as ourselves, right?</p>
<p t="919750" d="4540">It's weird – let's say you're home
alone, and you get freaked out and all these</p>
<p t="924290" d="5489">images come to mind; do you think of those
images as part of you?</p>
<p t="929779" d="2691">You think of them more as these things that
appeared to you.</p>
<p t="932470" d="2840">That's what you think about your dreams.</p>
<p t="935310" d="2959">They're things that appeared to you - they're
not you.</p>
<p t="938269" d="1231">Why would you think that?</p>
<p t="939500" d="6380">I mean, they're in your experiential space,
so why is there that separation between you</p>
<p t="945880" d="1000">and your dream?</p>
<p t="946880" d="1160">“I had a dream.”</p>
<p t="948040" d="1700">Not, “I thought up a dream.”</p>
<p t="949740" d="3640">Or, “look what I created,” it's like
there you are, the observer, and up comes</p>
<p t="953380" d="1000">a dream.</p>
<p t="954380" d="1360">It's very, very weird.</p>
<p t="955740" d="5480">It shows you that there are forces operating
in your psyche that are impersonal, genuinely</p>
<p t="961220" d="1000">impersonal.</p>
<p t="962220" d="2559">That's part of what you call the collective
unconscious.</p>
<p t="964779" d="3791">It's the thing that generates these weird
images and protects you.</p>
<p t="968570" d="2220">It's nature, that's for sure.</p>
<p t="970790" d="2590">It can be absolutely terrifying.</p>
<p t="973380" d="5190">People can have dreams that are so terrible
– well like the one my little nephew had,</p>
<p t="978570" d="6949">that's pretty damn nasty; little greasy
dwarf things with big beaks, that's a very</p>
<p t="985519" d="3990">ugly representation, and if that wasn't
bad enough there had to be a fire-breathing</p>
<p t="989509" d="2450">dragon behind them, creating them endlessly.</p>
<p t="991959" d="2591">There's no bloody-wonder he was waking up
screaming.</p>
<p t="994550" d="3479">It's like, “Oh no, I figured out what
life is like.”</p>
<p t="998029" d="2791">At four, that's pretty traumatic.</p>
<p t="1000820" d="2430">So, okay, now the left hemisphere.</p>
<p t="1003250" d="1509">This is Elkonon Goldberg's hypothesis.</p>
<p t="1004759" d="8890">You get one hemisphere or system that operates
when you know what you're doing and when</p>
<p t="1013649" d="1891">what you want is happening.</p>
<p t="1015540" d="5820">That's the happy-talky part that thinks
it knows what-the-hell is going on.</p>
<p t="1021360" d="3199">Then you have another part that only turns
on when you don't know what's going on.</p>
<p t="1024559" d="2471">It's full of anxiety and negative emotion.</p>
<p t="1027030" d="3720">The right hemisphere, by the way, is specialized
for negative emotion.</p>
<p t="1030750" d="5569">If you sustain right, pre-frontal damage,
you become inappropriately happy.</p>
<p t="1036319" d="2390">You're full of positive illusions.</p>
<p t="1038709" d="2100">You think, “well, that's an excellent
thing.”</p>
<p t="1040809" d="5571">It's not – you make really impulsive risky
decisions and your life goes directly to hell.</p>
<p t="1046380" d="3120">You need the negative emotion, obviously.</p>
<p t="1049500" d="4429">The reason you suffer with negative emotion
is because if you didn't suffer with negative</p>
<p t="1053929" d="3891">emotion, you'd suffer from being destroyed.</p>
<p t="1057820" d="1599">Those are your options.</p>
<p t="1059419" d="3801">There are people, by the way, who are born
without pain.</p>
<p t="1063220" d="1600">You think, “hey, that's a good deal.”</p>
<p t="1064820" d="4479">They never last past twenty, and part of the
reason for that is – you don't notice</p>
<p t="1069299" d="3421">this – but while you're sitting there,
you're going like this all the time.</p>
<p t="1072720" d="5850">The reason for that is that if you sit for
any length of time on one part of your body,</p>
<p t="1078570" d="3010">then it doesn't get much blood and it doesn't
get oxygenated.</p>
<p t="1081580" d="3720">You do that, it bitches a little bit, a little
pain, so you shift.</p>
<p t="1085300" d="3200">You shift and you shift, so you're just
doing this all of the time.</p>
<p t="1088500" d="3540">Otherwise you wear out your damn body and
you get bed sores, or that sort of thing.</p>
<p t="1092040" d="5040">These people that don't have any pain, they
just wear themselves out.</p>
<p t="1097080" d="2980">So you need the negative emotion, it keeps
you going.</p>
<p t="1100060" d="4840">It can get out of hand and have its own pathologies,
but it's definitely necessary.</p>
<p t="1104900" d="2630">So the right hemisphere does negative emotion.</p>
<p t="1107530" d="3600">Inhibition of behavior – that's the freezing
that's attended on anxiety.</p>
<p t="1111130" d="4520">It does image processing, holistic thinking
– so it's the quick and dirty hemisphere</p>
<p t="1115650" d="4260">- pattern recognition, pattern generation
and gross motor action.</p>
<p t="1119910" d="4450">That's interesting too, because the gross
motor action is, again, the quick and dirty</p>
<p t="1124360" d="1120">stuff.</p>
<p t="1125480" d="5819">If you need to slap something away, it doesn't
really matter that it's a gross-motor gesture.</p>
<p t="1131299" d="5461">You don't have to go like this, and be precise;
it can just be fast and sloppy, and it will</p>
<p t="1136760" d="1000">still work.</p>
<p t="1137760" d="4240">Now the left hemisphere is specialized for
when you know what-the-hell's going on and</p>
<p t="1142000" d="2460">you can concentrate on the details.</p>
<p t="1144460" d="3970">So then you can think about it in terms of
the hierarchy that we discussed, right?</p>
<p t="1148430" d="5810">So what it implies is that at the level of
specific, fine, detailed motor output, the</p>
<p t="1154240" d="1570">left hemisphere is operating.</p>
<p t="1155810" d="4040">That's kind of associated with positive
affect – I know exactly what I'm doing</p>
<p t="1159850" d="3420">and I'm making minor adjustments and everything's
going well.</p>
<p t="1163270" d="5850">If you go up the hierarchy towards more and
more abstracted representations then increasingly,</p>
<p t="1169120" d="2960">that's moving over to right hemisphere space.</p>
<p t="1172080" d="6360">So that's also partly why, when you disrupt
those higher-order structures, literally all</p>
<p t="1178440" d="1310">hell breaks loose.</p>
<p t="1179750" d="1669">So, left hemispheres.</p>
<p t="1181419" d="4880">Operation in explored territory – positive
emotion, activation of behavior, so that's</p>
<p t="1186299" d="1051">also exploration.</p>
<p t="1187350" d="7670">Word processing, linear thinking, detail recognition,
detail generation, and fine motor action.</p>
<p t="1195020" d="3370">So you need one system that works when you
don't know what's going on and you need</p>
<p t="1198390" d="3230">another system that works when you do.</p>
<p t="1201620" d="2299">Sometimes you're where you don't know
what you're doing and sometimes you're</p>
<p t="1203919" d="1750">where do know what you're doing.</p>
<p t="1205669" d="6071">Now Ramachandran, who's a fairly famous
neurologist, who operates out of LA, he associated</p>
<p t="1211740" d="4690">the totalitarian ego with hyper domination
of the left hemisphere.</p>
<p t="1216430" d="3550">The reason he did that is very cool.</p>
<p t="1219980" d="7610">So he's got these patients that have – what's
it called, is it agnosia?</p>
<p t="1227590" d="2880">It isn't, we'll call it neglect.</p>
<p t="1230470" d="1860">Okay so this is what happens.</p>
<p t="1232330" d="5709">You have a stroke and the stroke affects the
back part of the right hemisphere, alright?</p>
<p t="1238039" d="2601">So what happens?</p>
<p t="1240640" d="4020">Your left side is paralyzed; you can't do
anything with it.</p>
<p t="1244660" d="4810">Okay, so, however you also don't notice
that it's not working, so one of the things</p>
<p t="1249470" d="4490">you might do if you do become aware – you're
laying in bed, you've had a stroke and for</p>
<p t="1253960" d="3460">some reason you notice that there's an arm
lying in there with you.</p>
<p t="1257420" d="2680">Then what you do is you try to pick it up
with your other hand and you try to throw</p>
<p t="1260100" d="2310">it out of the bed.</p>
<p t="1262410" d="2290">When you find out that it's attached to
you, because it's not your arm, you're</p>
<p t="1264700" d="3400">not very happy – or maybe you throw yourself
right out of bed.</p>
<p t="1268100" d="4150">Then if someone gets you to draw a clock you
draw half a clock and if you eat a plateful</p>
<p t="1272250" d="4570">of food you eat half the plate, unless someone
turns it – and then you eat half of that.</p>
<p t="1276820" d="4940">So half the world is gone – it's hard
to imagine what that would be like.</p>
<p t="1281760" d="5170">I think what it's sort of like is – you
know how there's a whole world behind you?</p>
<p t="1286930" d="5119">You don't detect it as not there – it's
not black or anything, like when your eyes</p>
<p t="1292049" d="2201">are closed – it's just not there.</p>
<p t="1294250" d="5429">I think what happens with people with neglect
is that the “not there” becomes three</p>
<p t="1299679" d="1951">quarters instead of just half.</p>
<p t="1301630" d="3799">It's something like that anyways.</p>
<p t="1305429" d="4161">You don't know what's going on and there
you are like this and someone says to you,</p>
<p t="1309590" d="2860">“I notice that you can't move your left
arm today.”</p>
<p t="1312450" d="1000">What do you say?</p>
<p t="1313450" d="2540">You say, “that's because I'm tired.”</p>
<p t="1315990" d="3940">Or, “I don't feel like moving it.”</p>
<p t="1319930" d="3850">And so forth, so you have this reason that
you're not going to move it.</p>
<p t="1323780" d="4050">You might say the same thing about the left
foot, “yeah well I don't feel like moving</p>
<p t="1327830" d="1000">it.</p>
<p t="1328830" d="2300">“ You'll have some story about why you're
not going to move it.</p>
<p t="1331130" d="1840">Okay so that's fine.</p>
<p t="1332970" d="3260">Freudian's thought about that is traumatic
denial.</p>
<p t="1336230" d="5710">It was so overwhelming to you that you lost
the left part of your body.</p>
<p t="1341940" d="2600">You couldn't face it and you just denied
it happened.</p>
<p t="1344540" d="6759">It's not a bad theory, it's not quite
right, but it's not a bad theory.</p>
<p t="1351299" d="2240">I'll tell you a couple of related stories.</p>
<p t="1353539" d="2511">Let's say you're on dialysis.</p>
<p t="1356050" d="1270">That sucks.</p>
<p t="1357320" d="3500">You have to have this big thing in your arm,
it's like a shunt, and you have to go get</p>
<p t="1360820" d="3410">hooked up to a dialysis machine like all the
time.</p>
<p t="1364230" d="2699">Your kidneys are failing and who wants that?</p>
<p t="1366929" d="4391">Nobody, so everybody thinks: time for a kidney
transplant, and then they're on a long waiting</p>
<p t="1371320" d="1850">list and they get one kidney.</p>
<p t="1373170" d="3050">That's not very many kidneys.</p>
<p t="1376220" d="3569">Then they say, “okay, you got your kidney
and everyone's thrilled about that, here's</p>
<p t="1379789" d="3011">your anti-rejection medication, make sure
you take it.</p>
<p t="1382800" d="4070">Then a year later you lose your kidney, why?</p>
<p t="1386870" d="3321">You don't take your damn anti-rejection
medication, that's the most common reason.</p>
<p t="1390191" d="3699">You might think, well why in the world would
you not take your anti-rejection medication?</p>
<p t="1393890" d="2019">The Freudians would say denial.</p>
<p t="1395909" d="7071">Here's a different hypothesis: Your whole
map of you is person with kidney.</p>
<p t="1402980" d="3230">Then you lose your kidneys and it's like
you're a whole, weird thing that you have</p>
<p t="1406210" d="1240">no idea about.</p>
<p t="1407450" d="3530">It's virtually impossible for you to update
your model.</p>
<p t="1410980" d="2210">You think, does that make any sense?</p>
<p t="1413190" d="1650">Have you ever lost a tooth?</p>
<p t="1414840" d="1000">Right.</p>
<p t="1415840" d="2030">What does your tongue do for six months?</p>
<p t="1417870" d="5330">You're sitting there and your tongue is
fiddling away there like a mad dog investigating</p>
<p t="1423200" d="5260">every teensy nook and cranny like it's an
obsessive exploratory device.</p>
<p t="1428460" d="2140">It does it even when you don't want it to.</p>
<p t="1430600" d="2720">Then six months later you get your mouth remapped.</p>
<p t="1433320" d="4900">That's just a tooth, man; lose a kidney
and see what happens.</p>
<p t="1438220" d="3350">Or lose the whole left side of you body, it's
like, what are you going to do about that?</p>
<p t="1441570" d="5469">Well, okay, then Ramachandran, he's testing
these people for balance.</p>
<p t="1447039" d="7801">What he does is he checks out this phenomena
called nystagmus, and so if you pour cold</p>
<p t="1454840" d="4350">water in someone's ear their eyes will move
back and forth because it screws up the – you</p>
<p t="1459190" d="4400">know you have a balance system in you, in
ear your ear – and if you pour cold water</p>
<p t="1463590" d="3360">in there it screws it up and then your eyes
move back and forth.</p>
<p t="1466950" d="1820">You know, it's not very pleasant.</p>
<p t="1468770" d="5480">What he found was that if he poured cold water
in the left ear, then all of a sudden the</p>
<p t="1474250" d="3779">people would wake up and go, “Oh my God,
I don't have the left side of my body,”</p>
<p t="1478029" d="4171">and then they'd have a catastrophic emotional
experience and they'd be all upset about</p>
<p t="1482200" d="4570">it crying away; which is of course what they
should do.</p>
<p t="1486770" d="3769">Twenty minutes later it would wear off and
you'd say is there anything wrong with your</p>
<p t="1490539" d="3781">left side and they'd say well yeah, I just
don't feel like moving it.</p>
<p t="1494320" d="5420">So what seems to have happened is something
– so there's a body representation center</p>
<p t="1499740" d="3090">in the back of the right hemisphere.</p>
<p t="1502830" d="4060">You blow that sucker out with a stroke, and
that means that you can't represent that</p>
<p t="1506890" d="1900">part of your body anymore.</p>
<p t="1508790" d="4110">Maybe there are tatters of it left; it's
like a network that's damaged and under</p>
<p t="1512900" d="4210">some conditions you can more or less get it
to operate so you pour some cold water in</p>
<p t="1517110" d="2569">the ear and you shock the whole system.</p>
<p t="1519679" d="4521">Then there's enough neurological activity
so the network kicks in, even though it's</p>
<p t="1524200" d="4780">damaged for ten minutes, and then you get
this tremendous burst of negative emotion</p>
<p t="1528980" d="4100">- which is what the right hemisphere should
be doing when you lose half of your body.</p>
<p t="1533080" d="4329">You experience that when your left hemisphere
is flapping away trying to account for this</p>
<p t="1537409" d="4111">– which it can't, because it's such
a massive, utter catastrophe.</p>
<p t="1541520" d="5830">Then you know, the shock wears off and “bang!”
the system shuts back down, and “poof!”</p>
<p t="1547350" d="1580">you're back in denial.</p>
<p t="1548930" d="4041">That's a good example of the relationship
between the left hemisphere and the right</p>
<p t="1552971" d="1000">hemisphere.</p>
<p t="1553971" d="3338">The left hemisphere has a fixed idea about
the world.</p>
<p t="1557309" d="5521">So in some sense you might think about it
as the instantiation of your latest avatar;</p>
<p t="1562830" d="2969">you can certainly see that with people who
are ideologically possessed.</p>
<p t="1565799" d="5141">They've got this verbal system that accounts
for the whole world and there's just no</p>
<p t="1570940" d="2540">damn way that thing's going anywhere.</p>
<p t="1573480" d="6040">It's got this totalitarian aspect because
it wants to explain every last thing; it doesn't</p>
<p t="1579520" d="1269">like anomaly at all.</p>
<p t="1580789" d="2630">It hasn't come to terms with anomaly at
all.</p>
<p t="1583419" d="4901">There's no sense of transformation within
the system, which is partly why totalitarian</p>
<p t="1588320" d="3120">systems die.</p>
<p t="1591440" d="4290">The Red Queen said to Alice in Wonderland
when she was in the underworld, “in my kingdom</p>
<p t="1595730" d="3329">you have to run as fast as you can just to
stay in the same place.”</p>
<p t="1599059" d="3131">That's why totalitarian systems don't
work.</p>
<p t="1602190" d="3040">The damn environment keeps shifting around
on them.</p>
<p t="1605230" d="5420">If they're fixed in place, the gap between
their theory and reality gets larger and larger</p>
<p t="1610650" d="5960">and larger and larger until finally they fall
into a pit; and that's the end of it.</p>
<p t="1616610" d="2760">That's what happens to people too, if they
don't stay updated.</p>
<p t="1619370" d="7650">They let things get away on them; eventually
the ignored reality comes flooding back, and</p>
<p t="1627020" d="3610">we'll see that represented in mythology
because it's represented very nicely in</p>
<p t="1630630" d="1000">mythology.</p>
<p t="1631630" d="6100">It's why often dragons in fairytales, for
example, in the Saint George story, and in</p>
<p t="1637730" d="4020">the Hobbit for that matter – the dragon
is an eternal thing: it lives underneath the</p>
<p t="1641750" d="3559">earth and most of the time it leaves you the
hell alone.</p>
<p t="1645309" d="4441">Now and then it comes back and it tries to
destroy the city, and then you have to zip</p>
<p t="1649750" d="3200">out there and fight the thing so you can get
it to go back in its hole.</p>
<p t="1652950" d="3699">Maybe you get the treasure that it's carrying,
and then it's back in the hole for while;</p>
<p t="1656649" d="1890">but that thing's coming back.</p>
<p t="1658539" d="5021">It's always coming back, and so you build
the walls and all that, that's fine.</p>
<p t="1663560" d="3080">A dragon can destroy any walls.</p>
<p t="1666640" d="3070">Walls aren't enough – you have to be prepared
to go out there and fight the damn thing,</p>
<p t="1669710" d="3360">and that's how you keep it at bay.</p>
<p t="1673070" d="3431">That basically means you have to maintain
everything that you build, it's something</p>
<p t="1676501" d="1239">like that, right?</p>
<p t="1677740" d="3460">Otherwise it falls apart with increasing entropy.</p>
<p t="1681200" d="10830">Alright, so 
Goldberg thought about this as an anomaly</p>
<p t="1692030" d="2760">system, a novelty system and a routinization
system.</p>
<p t="1694790" d="9259">I intended to think about it from more of
an Anthropological or an Ethological perspective;</p>
<p t="1704049" d="3191">thinking about an animal (us) in our natural
environment.</p>
<p t="1707240" d="6100">It's not so much novelty versus routinization,
as it's explored versus unexplored territory.</p>
<p t="1713340" d="5199">That's what the world's made out of – it's
made out of explored versus unexplored territory.</p>
<p t="1718539" d="5380">So there's a domain that you inhabit, which
is the center of the universe, from a mythological</p>
<p t="1723919" d="3051">perspective, with you right in the middle
of it.</p>
<p t="1726970" d="4680">Around you is this circle, which is your place,
which you move around with you, and in that</p>
<p t="1731650" d="2159">circle you know what-the-hell's going on.</p>
<p t="1733809" d="5181">That's partly because you've mapped it,
but it's also partly because you don't</p>
<p t="1738990" d="1540">go outside of it.</p>
<p t="1740530" d="4860">You have your friends and you have your routine
and that's nested inside your culture, and</p>
<p t="1745390" d="2990">you try and keep that thing from flipping
upside down.</p>
<p t="1748380" d="5779">You do that all sorts of way: partly by doing
the same thing all the time, but also partly</p>
<p t="1754159" d="5041">by refusing to go anywhere that might seriously
challenge your beliefs.</p>
<p t="1759200" d="3729">Fair enough, you can understand that, although
it makes you weak to do that, because you're</p>
<p t="1762929" d="1731">not as prepared as you might be.</p>
<p t="1764660" d="9629">So you could say human beings are tribal,
social animals that have a territory.</p>
<p t="1774289" d="1671">Then you think, “well what's the territory?”</p>
<p t="1775960" d="4380">Well let's say tree-dwelling chimp ancestors;
the territory's the jungle.</p>
<p t="1780340" d="1000">No, it's not.</p>
<p t="1781340" d="2449">That's not the territory.</p>
<p t="1783789" d="7250">The territory is a little bit of the jungle,
plus the things that come in from the outside,</p>
<p t="1791039" d="5020">plus the primate dominance hierarchy that
exists in that area.</p>
<p t="1796059" d="4381">So that's the territory, that's the environment.</p>
<p t="1800440" d="5170">For mythological reasons we tend to make a
separation between the environment and culture.</p>
<p t="1805610" d="5919">Yes, it makes sense at one level of analysis,
but at another level of analysis all it does</p>
<p t="1811529" d="1370">is screw you up.</p>
<p t="1812899" d="5451">You're territory, fundamentally, isn't
the world; not the natural, objective world.</p>
<p t="1818350" d="3170">You want to stay as far away from that thing
as you possibly can.</p>
<p t="1821520" d="6740">Your territory is that circle of people with
whom you spend ninety percent of your time.</p>
<p t="1828260" d="4740">If you're a chimp, for example, or some
other kind of monkey, highly social, what</p>
<p t="1833000" d="1260">do you do all day?</p>
<p t="1834260" d="5380">You sleep, you eat, you chew leaves if you're
a chimp, and you groom other chimps.</p>
<p t="1839640" d="5500">It's constant social interaction, and you're
jockeying for a position in the dominance</p>
<p t="1845140" d="4670">hierarchy like mean girls in that movie, you
know.</p>
<p t="1849810" d="3190">You're mapping out the social territory
knowing who's who, and what's what, and</p>
<p t="1853000" d="2170">then trying to get up somewhere near the top.</p>
<p t="1855170" d="11759">That's your environment, that's your environment,
and so your world is that social, natural</p>
<p t="1866929" d="5681">circle, which is a four-dimensional territory,
because its got length, width and height – plus</p>
<p t="1872610" d="1510">it stretches across time.</p>
<p t="1874120" d="4370">So it's this transforming natural entity.</p>
<p t="1878490" d="2161">Inside that there's a pyramid.</p>
<p t="1880651" d="3479">The pyramid is made out of all the primates
that you interact with.</p>
<p t="1884130" d="3460">That's the world; circle with a pyramid
on it.</p>
<p t="1887590" d="3650">Now I'll give you a vision, this is a vision
I had once when I was trying to figure this</p>
<p t="1891240" d="1000">stuff out.</p>
<p t="1892240" d="1750">Now what is the world?</p>
<p t="1893990" d="6500">So imagine that there's a field in front
of you that stretches as far as you can see.</p>
<p t="1900490" d="2630">You're flying above it.</p>
<p t="1903120" d="2460">What you see everywhere are these pyramids.</p>
<p t="1905580" d="4459">Let's say for the sake of argument, that
they're skyscrapers made out of glass.</p>
<p t="1910039" d="1951">There are tears in them.</p>
<p t="1911990" d="4520">You fly down and one's here and one's
here, and some of them are really big and</p>
<p t="1916510" d="2039">some of them are really small.</p>
<p t="1918549" d="1461">They're just everywhere.</p>
<p t="1920010" d="3900">You're flying around above them, and you
fly close enough to look inside and what you</p>
<p t="1923910" d="4870">see inside them are people all packed together,
trying to scramble up to the top.</p>
<p t="1928780" d="3430">That's the world, that's reality.</p>
<p t="1932210" d="3900">The funny thing is, is that you can be in
one of those pyramids clambering away to the</p>
<p t="1936110" d="3179">top, or you can be flying above it – those
are your options.</p>
<p t="1939289" d="3831">If you have to choose, you should be flying
above it.</p>
<p t="1943120" d="5669">So the relationship between the self and the
ego avatar is the same as the relationship</p>
<p t="1948789" d="4051">between the thing that's flying above, and
the thing that's within one of those pyramids</p>
<p t="1952840" d="2230">trying to scramble to the top.</p>
<p t="1955070" d="1870">You know, well you say well I'm going to
get to the top.</p>
<p t="1956940" d="1709">“Top of what?”</p>
<p t="1958649" d="3181">There's a hundred tops, there's two hundred
tops.</p>
<p t="1961830" d="2949">Then you might say, “well is there anything
above the top?”</p>
<p t="1964779" d="6650">There is, there's the part of you that isn't
entrapped within that particular system and</p>
<p t="1971429" d="2041">that can move from place to place.</p>
<p t="1973470" d="3730">If you look at Egyptian mythology: so you
know you'll see if you look at the back</p>
<p t="1977200" d="3140">of the American dollar bill, that's a symbol
of value, right?</p>
<p t="1980340" d="2260">Okay, so what's the pyramid?</p>
<p t="1982600" d="1940">There's a pyramid on it, right?</p>
<p t="1984540" d="1479">What's the top of a pyramid?</p>
<p t="1986019" d="2160">It's a triangle, it's separate from the
pyramid.</p>
<p t="1988179" d="1730">There's an eye inside of it.</p>
<p t="1989909" d="5191">That's because the top of the pyramid is
an eye, and it's separate from the pyramid.</p>
<p t="1995100" d="8400">What that means, fundamentally, is that the
thing that transcends the structure is attention,</p>
<p t="2003500" d="1750">voluntary attention.</p>
<p t="2005250" d="5890">Now the Egyptians worshiped voluntary attention
in the form of Horus, because he was a God.</p>
<p t="2011140" d="2590">I'll tell you about Horus in detail.</p>
<p t="2013730" d="4559">One of Horus' avatars was the falcon.</p>
<p t="2018289" d="2270">The reason for that is falcons can really,
really, really see.</p>
<p t="2020559" d="4551">They fly around, and so they're like the
king's eyes.</p>
<p t="2025110" d="3110">Like the little bird Zazu in the Lion King.</p>
<p t="2028220" d="3730">He was the king's eyes, the thing that flies
around above.</p>
<p t="2031950" d="4620">He was a particular enemy of Scar, remember
Scar eats him at the beginning and then spits</p>
<p t="2036570" d="1110">him out.</p>
<p t="2037680" d="4109">The reason that the King's eyes is an enemy
of scar is because the King's eyes can see</p>
<p t="2041789" d="1551">what he is, right?</p>
<p t="2043340" d="5259">He's the eternal force that works to disrupt
the kingdom and bring everything into ruins.</p>
<p t="2048599" d="5830">Classic myth, classic myth, partly accounting
for why it was the largest selling, highest</p>
<p t="2054429" d="1571">grossing cartoon in Disney history.</p>
<p t="2056000" d="6280">They got the mythology pretty right.</p>
<p t="2062280" d="12599">So you might say, “what's a human being
like?”</p>
<p t="2074879" d="8001">Remember I told you that when Penfield was
mapping the brain he was poking people.</p>
<p t="2082880" d="4630">You can either poke them along the sensory
strip, which is – if the motor strip is</p>
<p t="2087510" d="3629">here, the sensory strip is just behind it.</p>
<p t="2091139" d="4891">The motor strip is where the motor systems
of your body are represented in so far as</p>
<p t="2096030" d="1940">you can control them.</p>
<p t="2097970" d="5220">The sensory strip is where the sensory systems
are represented in so far as you can feel</p>
<p t="2103190" d="1000">them.</p>
<p t="2104190" d="6460">So what this is, is a – the body is laid
out weirdly on the motor cortex.</p>
<p t="2110650" d="4030">One of the things that's pretty funny is
that the genitalia area in the sensory cortex</p>
<p t="2114680" d="2120">is right beside the feet.</p>
<p t="2116800" d="5520">So I think that's why people have foot fetishes
and love foot massages, is because they're</p>
<p t="2122320" d="4680">spreading activation from the foot area to
the genital area, and God only knows why that</p>
<p t="2127000" d="1000">is.</p>
<p t="2128000" d="4060">Maybe because you had to have had really sensitive
feet to stomp around without stepping on really</p>
<p t="2132060" d="1610">horrible things.</p>
<p t="2133670" d="7520">So you can put this weird, stretched-out,
body representation together in a representational</p>
<p t="2141190" d="5060">form like this, they call that the homunculus,
which is like a little-man that exists inside</p>
<p t="2146250" d="1030">your brain.</p>
<p t="2147280" d="3030">So what you see, that's the motor-homunculus,
not the sensory-homunculus.</p>
<p t="2150310" d="2320">So what do you see?</p>
<p t="2152630" d="2630">Well what is a person as far as its brain
is concerned?</p>
<p t="2155260" d="3160">Well, hand – that's for sure.</p>
<p t="2158420" d="4830">Thumb, that's for sure – your thumb is
as representative of your whole body.</p>
<p t="2163250" d="6250">It's because your torso is hardly represented
at all.</p>
<p t="2169500" d="1200">Why is that?</p>
<p t="2170700" d="3370">How many things do you manipulate with your
chest?</p>
<p t="2174070" d="1360">None.</p>
<p t="2175430" d="4159">You don't have motor control over it, so
it's not represented.</p>
<p t="2179589" d="3991">So, the hands man, those things, they're
represented like mad.</p>
<p t="2183580" d="2760">So are the face, and the lips and the tongue.</p>
<p t="2186340" d="4249">There's a bunch of reasons for that: One
is when you're an infant, you explore like</p>
<p t="2190589" d="4741">mad with your mouth – but you do that your
whole life because when you eat- you know</p>
<p t="2195330" d="1000">what it's like.</p>
<p t="2196330" d="4080">If you're eating something and there's
a bit of sand in it, you find it and you take</p>
<p t="2200410" d="1000">it out.</p>
<p t="2201410" d="3760">You can detect this teeny, little thing that's
not supposed to be in your mouth.</p>
<p t="2205170" d="3800">Well that's a good thing because lots of
things aren't supposed to be in your mouth.</p>
<p t="2208970" d="1710">That's part of the reason.</p>
<p t="2210680" d="3540">The other part of the reason is, well think
about what you do with your tongue?</p>
<p t="2214220" d="4440">There are a lot of things you do with your
tongue: Some of them are eating, some of them</p>
<p t="2218660" d="1220">are talking.</p>
<p t="2219880" d="4920">Some of them are all sorts of intimate behaviors,
that thing is wired up; and it's wired up</p>
<p t="2224800" d="1330">right at birth.</p>
<p t="2226130" d="6010">Then it's the same with your lips and the
rest of your mouth, you use that to communicate.</p>
<p t="2232140" d="4130">Your hands wander around, taking the world
apart, and putting it back together, which</p>
<p t="2236270" d="4640">is exactly what your brain does, and then
you blab about what you're doing to everyone.</p>
<p t="2240910" d="2250">That's basically a human being.</p>
<p t="2243160" d="6320">I like to think of this thing as it's a
comical representation of the hero that goes</p>
<p t="2249480" d="2320">out to confront the world, right?</p>
<p t="2251800" d="1470">The hero has two elements.</p>
<p t="2253270" d="6430">One is explore, and that's where the west
is powerful.</p>
<p t="2259700" d="3750">We have a really well developed mythology
of the exploratory hero.</p>
<p t="2263450" d="2680">Where we're not so well developed is the
second part.</p>
<p t="2266130" d="5180">In the second part of the classic hero story,
you're supposed to come back and communicate</p>
<p t="2271310" d="2039">about what you've found.</p>
<p t="2273349" d="4260">So if there's an individual exploration
element, and then there's a communicate</p>
<p t="2277609" d="2551">and update the culture element.</p>
<p t="2280160" d="4200">Both of those are equally important an it's
something we don't do well, we don't have</p>
<p t="2284360" d="5170">much respect for tradition in the west, and
it's a really, really big problem.</p>
<p t="2289530" d="5000">The ethical responsibility of a human being
is to take the dead culture, so that's the</p>
<p t="2294530" d="5670">dead father, or the dead God, and to revivify
it with attention and communication.</p>
<p t="2300200" d="3530">If you fail to do that then everything disappears.</p>
<p t="2303730" d="3800">We're failing to do that – we're leaving
it all behind instead.</p>
<p t="2307530" d="2049">It's not a good idea.</p>
<p t="2309579" d="6701">You know if the old Gods die as Nietzsche
said they had, new Gods swoop in very rapidly</p>
<p t="2316280" d="5350">and if you thought the old God was bad, you
wait until the new God gets a hold of you.</p>
<p t="2321630" d="5120">So, well we saw what happened in the twentieth
century, with all of the ideologies that sprang</p>
<p t="2326750" d="2560">up in the absence of classical religious belief.</p>
<p t="2329310" d="5400">Okay, you're not so thrilled with Catholicism,
if you think about that as the fundamental</p>
<p t="2334710" d="1460">tradition of the West.</p>
<p t="2336170" d="2460">You know, with the witch burnings and the
inquisition and all that.</p>
<p t="2338630" d="4820">It's like yeah, yeah, get a load of the
Nazis and then see what you think; or the</p>
<p t="2343450" d="8460">Communists for that matter - from bad to worse
in an unimaginable way.</p>
<p t="2351910" d="5709">You know, and it's partly because those
archaic systems, those archaic, religious</p>
<p t="2357619" d="4191">systems, they weren't ideologies, they were
a whole different class of thing.</p>
<p t="2361810" d="4049">We don't understand them very well, and
it's not good because you cannot live without</p>
<p t="2365859" d="1061">understanding them.</p>
<p t="2366920" d="1780">You don't know who you are.</p>
<p t="2368700" d="3899">Then you fall prey to weird mental diseases,
like Nihilism, that's one.</p>
<p t="2372599" d="5270">The other one is ideological possession – so
you become a Totalitarian or a Nihilist.</p>
<p t="2377869" d="2301">That's a bad outcome.</p>
<p t="2380170" d="2020">You might think, “well, what's the alternative?”</p>
<p t="2382190" d="2500">Well, you know what happens in Pinocchio,
right?</p>
<p t="2384690" d="1020">You've watched Pinocchio?</p>
<p t="2385710" d="3250">Okay, I often show Pinocchio to this class,
but I don't know if I'm going to do that</p>
<p t="2388960" d="1000">this year.</p>
<p t="2389960" d="2710">Anyways, Pinocchio, he's a puppet, a marionette.</p>
<p t="2392670" d="1290">Someone else is pulling his strings.</p>
<p t="2393960" d="1410">He has a wooden head.</p>
<p t="2395370" d="1020">He's not very bright.</p>
<p t="2396390" d="1930">He hasn't banged the world at all.</p>
<p t="2398320" d="4100">He's got a good father, the old Geppetto,
who would really rather that he was a real</p>
<p t="2402420" d="1700">boy, a real person.</p>
<p t="2404120" d="4940">So he's the kind of father that wants to
produce an individual, not a slave.</p>
<p t="2409060" d="4279">That's why in his workshop it's all friendly
and there's a nice fire, and he's making</p>
<p t="2413339" d="3431">toys and there's lots of music, it's like
“Go Geppetto!” he's a good guy.</p>
<p t="2416770" d="2440">He makes this little puppet and he sends him
out in the world.</p>
<p t="2419210" d="1609">He says, “go be a real boy.”</p>
<p t="2420819" d="8151">Well, Pinocchio runs into a whole class of
different obstacles; one is evil, that's</p>
<p t="2428970" d="7129">the Coachman, and the Italian stereotype guy
who makes him a dancing puppet celebrity.</p>
<p t="2436099" d="5311">I think that's pretty funny, that's really
prescient.</p>
<p t="2441410" d="6050">You might think well what's the goal of
your typical bone-headed, mid-adolescent in</p>
<p t="2447460" d="2020">North America – unearned celebrity.</p>
<p t="2449480" d="3510">Well that's exactly what Pinocchio goes
for first.</p>
<p t="2452990" d="4150">That doesn't work out so well because he
ends up a slave and then the next thing that</p>
<p t="2457140" d="4590">happens is he capitalizes on the fact that
he's vulnerable, and pretends he's sick</p>
<p t="2461730" d="4240">and goes off for a vacation, under the direction
of the Coachman (who's basically Satan in</p>
<p t="2465970" d="1000">disguise).</p>
<p t="2466970" d="5720">Then he goes out to treasure island and meets
all of the delinquents who are just like Nazis,</p>
<p t="2472690" d="5230">and turns out in fact the whole ploy is to
enslave everyone, to deprive them of their</p>
<p t="2477920" d="4070">voice – that's the donkey's breying
– and to make them into slaves.</p>
<p t="2481990" d="6690">Pretty damn horrifying and that movie came
out around the time that the Nazis were really</p>
<p t="2488680" d="2640">grasping power in central Europe.</p>
<p t="2491320" d="1890">They got it exactly right.</p>
<p t="2493210" d="3409">Here's what's really going on behind the
scenes.</p>
<p t="2496619" d="3661">Then what happens is Pinocchio turns halfway
into a braying donkey.</p>
<p t="2500280" d="4410">He's gone off the path and in order to get
back on it he tries to go home.</p>
<p t="2504690" d="3850">It's too late, he can't go home, because
he's not a kid anymore.</p>
<p t="2508540" d="3710">He goes home and Dad isn't there, surprise,
surprise.</p>
<p t="2512250" d="5760">Once you grow up and you go home, Dad isn't
there – it's just another human being.</p>
<p t="2518010" d="2550">So then what happens is he has to go into
the ocean.</p>
<p t="2520560" d="1950">Well that's particularly weird, right?</p>
<p t="2522510" d="5329">There he is, half donkey, he's a puppet,
the dove comes down and drops him a message</p>
<p t="2527839" d="1041">from God.</p>
<p t="2528880" d="4939">It's like the Holy Spirit descending, except
it's from the blue fairy, weirdly enough.</p>
<p t="2533819" d="4461">The message says you have to go to the deepest
part of the ocean and rescue your father.</p>
<p t="2538280" d="5300">Yeah that is what you have to do if you don't
want to be a bloody, puppet donkey.</p>
<p t="2543580" d="4440">You have to go down into the depths and find
your dead Father and you have to revivify</p>
<p t="2548020" d="1000">him.</p>
<p t="2549020" d="1000">That's what happens.</p>
<p t="2550020" d="4329">So Pinocchio goes way down there into the
deepest depths and finds Monstro, who's</p>
<p t="2554349" d="4641">a monster so terrible that the fish swim away
at the sound of his voice.</p>
<p t="2558990" d="6420">Just like, “he who shall not be named – Voldemort.”</p>
<p t="2565410" d="2189">You can't even say his damn name.</p>
<p t="2567599" d="1510">Same with Monstro.</p>
<p t="2569109" d="4211">Pinocchio goes down there, he goes into the
whale, what happens?</p>
<p t="2573320" d="4170">Geppetto says there's no getting out of
this, there's no getting out of this.</p>
<p t="2577490" d="3560">We just have to sit here and cook fish and
Pinocchio thinks, “cook!”</p>
<p t="2581050" d="4470">He starts breaking up all the chairs and everything
and his Father is freaking out, “what are</p>
<p t="2585520" d="1360">you doing breaking all of these chairs?</p>
<p t="2586880" d="1170">What are we going to sit out?”</p>
<p t="2588050" d="1569">Pinocchio lights them on fire.</p>
<p t="2589619" d="1421">He's a master of fire.</p>
<p t="2591040" d="1720">It's a Shemanic ritual.</p>
<p t="2592760" d="4660">He is a master of fire and that's what human
being is.</p>
<p t="2597420" d="4210">He gets everything burning, of course Geppetto's
all freaked out about that because what are</p>
<p t="2601630" d="2600">the going to sit on, and Pinocchio thinks,
“who cares about sitting?</p>
<p t="2604230" d="3420">We're going to solve the problem once and
for all.”</p>
<p t="2607650" d="3490">Then the whale turns into a fire-breathing
dragon, which is pretty damn weird thing for</p>
<p t="2611140" d="1120">a whale to do.</p>
<p t="2612260" d="4330">He half-kills Pinocchio, he washes up on shore
dead, but he saves his father.</p>
<p t="2616590" d="4320">Then at the very end of the movie he's lying
on his bed, all drowned.</p>
<p t="2620910" d="2730">So he's a dead puppet now.</p>
<p t="2623640" d="2640">Do you want to be a live puppet or a dead
puppet?</p>
<p t="2626280" d="3870">Well the maybe the dead puppet is better than
the live puppet, it depends on where your</p>
<p t="2630150" d="1000">going.</p>
<p t="2631150" d="3820">Then he's on the bed, and the blue fairy
comes down and says well you've been honest</p>
<p t="2634970" d="2040">and courageous, “bang!” now you're real.</p>
<p t="2637010" d="7720">Then they have a little part, and that's
just exactly right, they got that exactly</p>
<p t="2644730" d="1000">right.</p>
<p t="2645730" d="3480">That's part of the hero mythology, it's
the rescuing of the father.</p>
<p t="2649210" d="4970">Student: Why do you have to rescue the father?</p>
<p t="2654180" d="2050">Otherwise you're a corpse.</p>
<p t="2656230" d="6910">You're a historical creature, you're a
cultural creature.</p>
<p t="2663140" d="3300">You cannot live without your culture.</p>
<p t="2666440" d="2230">You think you can, but you can't.</p>
<p t="2668670" d="4190">it disappears, and look, I'll give an example.</p>
<p t="2672860" d="3920">In the Mesopotamian creation myth, which I'm
going to tell you about next week, one of</p>
<p t="2676780" d="5220">the things that happens is that the first
round of Gods, so they're like primordial</p>
<p t="2682000" d="4060">forces, they're pretty damn careless, and
they kill their father.</p>
<p t="2686060" d="3440">They make this place to live on his corpse.</p>
<p t="2689500" d="4380">That's where we live, we live on the corpse
of our ancestors.</p>
<p t="2693880" d="3580">We live in the society, it's dead, it's
the product of dead people.</p>
<p t="2697460" d="2840">It's got this dead element, but we're
living on it.</p>
<p t="2700300" d="5350">They're very careless, they kill it, so
they render it completely dead.</p>
<p t="2705650" d="4750">Well what happens is Tiamat, who's the Mother
of Chaos, she comes flooding back and she</p>
<p t="2710400" d="3750">thinks, “oh you killed the thing that protects
you.</p>
<p t="2714150" d="1880">You just wait to see what happens.”</p>
<p t="2716030" d="4480">That's exactly it, if you kill the thing
that structures you, you won't know it – it's</p>
<p t="2720510" d="3030">like Nietzsche's prediction from the death
of God.</p>
<p t="2723540" d="4620">You killed this, think it doesn't make any
difference, - wrong.</p>
<p t="2728160" d="3400">It's like the Striders protecting the Hobbits.</p>
<p t="2731560" d="4539">If you get rid of the thing that protects
you then chaos comes flooding in and you have</p>
<p t="2736099" d="1871">no idea what's possible.</p>
<p t="2737970" d="2490">We do, though, because we lived through the
twentieth century.</p>
<p t="2740460" d="2220">We know exactly what's possible.</p>
<p t="2742680" d="3880">Hundreds of millions of unnecessary deaths,
that's what's possible.</p>
<p t="2746560" d="5600">We're lucky we didn't blow the whole damn
thing up, and we still could.</p>
<p t="2752160" d="4330">People pursing their dead ideologies – you
don't rescue the dead Father, than you're</p>
<p t="2756490" d="2350">the puppet of death, that's what you are.</p>
<p t="2758840" d="4070">Okay, on that cheery note.</p>
