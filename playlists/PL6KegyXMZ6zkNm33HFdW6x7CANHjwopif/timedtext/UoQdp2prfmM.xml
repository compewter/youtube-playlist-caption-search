<p t="0" d="2000">oh</p>
<p t="18630" d="3559">Hello, everyone. Thank you again for showing up, so</p>
<p t="24779" d="2000">tonight</p>
<p t="26909" d="4220">We're going to finish off the story of Noah and also</p>
<p t="31919" d="2000">the story of</p>
<p t="33930" d="1950">the Tower of Babel</p>
<p t="35880" d="2509">and I don't think that'll take very long and</p>
<p t="39090" d="2000">then we're going to</p>
<p t="42390" d="2270">turn to the abrahamic Stories and</p>
<p t="46680" d="2839">They're a very complex set of stories. They sit between</p>
<p t="51179" d="1261">the</p>
<p t="52440" d="4040">Earliest stories in Genesis that I would say end with the tower of babel</p>
<p t="56480" d="4349">And then the stories of moses which are extraordinarily well-developed</p>
<p t="62640" d="2029">Abrahamic stories, there's a whole sequence of them</p>
<p t="65580" d="1800">multiple stories</p>
<p t="67380" d="2000">conjoined together and</p>
<p t="69540" d="2000">There I found them very daunting</p>
<p t="71909" d="2120">they're very difficult to understand and</p>
<p t="74520" d="959">so</p>
<p t="75479" d="5569">I'm going to stumble through them the best that I can I would say that's that's probably the best way to think about this because</p>
<p t="81720" d="1740">they</p>
<p t="83460" d="2900">Have a narrative content. That's quite strange</p>
<p t="87299" d="2000">I</p>
<p t="90689" d="5870">was reading a book while doing this called the disappearance of God that I found quite helpful, and</p>
<p t="99180" d="3199">the author of that book argues that</p>
<p t="103979" d="2930">one of the things that happens in the old testament is that</p>
<p t="107640" d="2540">God is very manifest at the beginning</p>
<p t="111210" d="4009">in terms of personal appearances even and then that</p>
<p t="115829" d="4580">proclivity fades away as the old testament develops, and there's a</p>
<p t="122850" d="1619">parallel development</p>
<p t="124469" d="6650">That it's maybe maybe causally linked. I'm not exactly sure how to conceptualize it, but that appears to be causally linked is that?</p>
<p t="132390" d="2000">the</p>
<p t="134670" d="7250">Stories about individuals become more and more well-developed so it says in it's as if as God fades away, so to speak</p>
<p t="142440" d="3079">the individual becomes more and more manifest and</p>
<p t="147569" d="4400">There's a statement in the old testament the location of which. I don't recall</p>
<p t="152610" d="4489">But I'll tell you about it in future lectures where God essentially tells</p>
<p t="158220" d="7250">Whoever he's speaking with and I don't remember who that is that he's going to disappear and let man essentially go his own way</p>
<p t="165860" d="5429">And see what happens not a complete disappearance, but maybe a transformations is something that</p>
<p t="171959" d="7850">Modern people regard more as a psychological phenomena rather than the sort of objective entity that God seems to be in</p>
<p t="180150" d="2000">the beginning of the biblical stories</p>
<p t="182760" d="2210">and so I've been wrestling with that a lot because</p>
<p t="185790" d="2000">the notion that</p>
<p t="188069" d="3919">God, I got appears to Abraham multiple times and</p>
<p t="193650" d="2570">that's not a concept that's easy for modern people to</p>
<p t="197010" d="2000">to grasp in</p>
<p t="199590" d="1380">for us</p>
<p t="200970" d="3229">generally speaking apart from say issues of Faith</p>
<p t="204989" d="1830">God is it some?</p>
<p t="206819" d="1230">thing</p>
<p t="208049" d="4070">someone who makes himself personally manifest in our lives</p>
<p t="212819" d="2000">He doesn't appear to us</p>
<p t="216359" d="3860">That's I suppose why the question of belief is so paramount for modern people</p>
<p t="220220" d="6569">I presume that if God had within the habit of appearing to you you likely wouldn't have a problem with belief</p>
<p t="226790" d="5490">I mean it might be more complicated than that, but that's how it seems to me, and so when we read stories about</p>
<p t="235049" d="6230">God making himself manifest either to a nation say in the case of israel or to individuals</p>
<p t="241530" d="2539">It's not easy to understand</p>
<p t="244919" d="5960">It's not easy to understand why people would write stories like that if they thought like we thought and I mean it really it wasn't</p>
<p t="250879" d="4440">That long ago that the Bible was written say from a biological perspective. It's really only yesterday</p>
<p t="255319" d="3629">It's a couple thousand years say four thousand years something like that</p>
<p t="259769" d="4880">That's not very long ago from a biological perspective, it's it's nothing</p>
<p t="266130" d="1320">so</p>
<p t="267450" d="2000">the first thing I tried to do is to</p>
<p t="269610" d="4890">see if I could figure out how to understand that and so else the lecture once we finish the the</p>
<p t="275860" d="5839">remains of the story of Noah, I'll start the lecture with a with an attempt to</p>
<p t="282640" d="5450">Situate the abrahamic stories in a context that might make them more accessible</p>
<p t="288430" d="2330">These two contexts that work for me to make them more accessible</p>
<p t="292960" d="1770">Let's conclude</p>
<p t="294730" d="1740">the Noah Story</p>
<p t="296470" d="2269">first however when we</p>
<p t="299680" d="1980">ended last time</p>
<p t="301660" d="5449">The ark had come to its resting place and Noah and his family had</p>
<p t="308410" d="1950">debarked</p>
<p t="310360" d="1470">and</p>
<p t="311830" d="2000">so this is the stories of</p>
<p t="314380" d="2779">What occurs immediately after afterwards?</p>
<p t="317920" d="3439">it's a very short story, but I think it's it's very relevant for</p>
<p t="322030" d="1140">both</p>
<p t="323170" d="4519">Of these stories the tower of babel is well very relevant for our current times and the sons of Noah</p>
<p t="328450" d="3830">That went forth of the ark were shem, and ham and Japheth and ham</p>
<p t="333130" d="2000">Is the father of Canaan?</p>
<p t="336040" d="5630">These are the three sons of Noah and of them was the whole Earth overspread and Noah began to be a husbandman</p>
<p t="342340" d="2660">and he planted a vine yard and</p>
<p t="345610" d="4130">he drank of the wine and was drunken and he was uncovered within his tent and</p>
<p t="350260" d="5900">Ham the father of Canaan saw the nakedness of his father and told his two brethren without?</p>
<p t="357430" d="4550">and shem and Japheth took a garment and laid upon both their shoulders and went backward and</p>
<p t="362170" d="4969">Covered the nakedness of their father and their faces were backward and they saw not their fathers nakedness</p>
<p t="367840" d="2929">And Noah awoke from his wine and knew what his younger son</p>
<p t="370770" d="7200">had done unto him and he said curse had to be Canaan a servant of servants shall he be unto his brethren and</p>
<p t="379540" d="6289">He said blessed shall be the lord. God of shem and Canaan Shall be his servant and God shall enlarge Japheth</p>
<p t="385830" d="3239">And he shall dwell in the tents of shem and Canaan Shall be his servant</p>
<p t="389620" d="6769">and Noah lived after the flood three hundred and fifty years and all the days of Noah were 950 years and he died and</p>
<p t="397870" d="3440">the whole Earth was of one language and of one speech okay, so</p>
<p t="402720" d="3450">I remember thinking about this story</p>
<p t="407710" d="2000">It's got to be 30 years ago</p>
<p t="411310" d="5330">And I think the meaning of the story stood out for me sometimes</p>
<p t="418060" d="6110">When you read complicated material sometimes a piece of it will stand out. It's for some reason. It's like it glitters</p>
<p t="424170" d="2699">I suppose that might be one way of thinking about it. It's</p>
<p t="427480" d="1050">it</p>
<p t="428530" d="6110">You're in sync with it, and you can understand what it means. I've really experienced that reading the Dao. De Jing which is document</p>
<p t="434640" d="3929">I would really like to do a lecture on at some point because some of the verses</p>
<p t="438570" d="1890">I don't understand but others stand right out</p>
<p t="440460" d="4080">and I can understand them and I think I understood what this part of the story of Noah meant and I</p>
<p t="444610" d="5450">think it means you know we talked a little bit about what nakedness meant in the story of Adam and Eve and</p>
<p t="450730" d="5750">The idea essentially was that to know yourself naked is to become aware of your vulnerability</p>
<p t="457390" d="3559">the physical Your physical boundaries in time and space and</p>
<p t="461680" d="3529">Your your your physiological</p>
<p t="466060" d="2000">your fundamental physiological</p>
<p t="468130" d="3979">Insufficiencies as they mate might be judged by others, so there's biological</p>
<p t="472660" d="5029">Insufficiency that sort of built into you because you're a fragile Mortal vulnerable half insane creature</p>
<p t="477690" d="3299">And that's that's just an existential truth, and then of course</p>
<p t="481690" d="1110">even</p>
<p t="482800" d="1320">merely as a</p>
<p t="484120" d="5450">Human being even with all those faults there are faults that you have that are particular to you that might be</p>
<p t="489729" d="1521">judged harshly by the group</p>
<p t="491250" d="2309">Well might be will definitely be judged</p>
<p t="493560" d="5640">Harshly by the group and so to become aware of your nakedness is to become self-conscious and and to and to</p>
<p t="499330" d="3799">Know your limits and to know your vulnerability, and that's what is</p>
<p t="503650" d="1350">revealed</p>
<p t="505000" d="4880">To ham when he comes across his father naked and so the question is</p>
<p t="510610" d="7070">What does it mean to see your father naked and it seems to me and especially in an inappropriate Manner like this it it?</p>
<p t="518500" d="2000">it's it's it's as if</p>
<p t="521320" d="2000">ham</p>
<p t="523690" d="3739">He does the same thing that happens in the mesopotamian creation myth</p>
<p t="527890" d="4010">When when time out and absolute give rise to the first gods</p>
<p t="532989" d="2390">there there the father of the eventual</p>
<p t="536050" d="1289">deity of</p>
<p t="537339" d="1620">redemption Marduk</p>
<p t="538959" d="4489">they're very careless and noisy and they kill apps, ooh their father and</p>
<p t="543639" d="4429">attempt to inhabit his corpse and that makes timeout enraged and so she</p>
<p t="548889" d="1980">Bursts Forth from The Darkness to</p>
<p t="550869" d="4880">To do them in it's like a precursor to the flood story or an analogue to the flood story</p>
<p t="555910" d="3889">And I see the same thing happening here with ham. Is that he's is</p>
<p t="560499" d="2299">insufficiently respectful of his father and</p>
<p t="563529" d="4039">The question is exactly what does the father represent and you can say well there's there's?</p>
<p t="568179" d="5630">There's the father that you have and that's a human being that's the demand like other men a man among men</p>
<p t="573939" d="3799">but then there's the farther as such and that's the spirit of the father and</p>
<p t="578290" d="5149">Insofar as you have a father you have both at the same time you have the personal father</p>
<p t="584079" d="2030">That's a man among other men</p>
<p t="586239" d="7340">just like anyone others father, but insofar as that man is your father that means that he's something different than just another person and</p>
<p t="594160" d="1919">what he is is the</p>
<p t="596079" d="2719">incarnation of the spirit of the Father and</p>
<p t="599709" d="3260">to see that to take it to what to</p>
<p t="603459" d="4460">Disrespect that carelessly, maybe even he's like no one makes a mistake right? He?</p>
<p t="609819" d="2720">produces wine and gets himself drunk and you might say well</p>
<p t="612540" d="5399">you know if he sprawled out there for everyone to see it's hardly hams fault if he stumbles across them but</p>
<p t="618999" d="6679">The book is laying out a danger and the danger is that well maybe you catch your father at</p>
<p t="625929" d="2240">his most vulnerable moment and if you're</p>
<p t="629199" d="1320">disrespectful</p>
<p t="630519" d="5630">Then you transgress against the spirit of the father and if you transgress against the spirit of father and lose</p>
<p t="636639" d="7369">Spirit of the father and lose respect for the spirit of the father then that is likely to transform you into a slave</p>
<p t="644619" d="3230">That's a very interesting idea and I think it's particularly interesting</p>
<p t="648639" d="7669">Maybe not particularly interesting, but it's it's particularly germane. I think to our current cultural situation because I think that</p>
<p t="657459" d="3859">We're pushed constantly to see the nakedness of our father so to speak</p>
<p t="662679" d="2960">because of the intense criticism, that's</p>
<p t="666339" d="4710">Directed towards our culture and the patriarch of culture, so to speak</p>
<p t="671689" d="4640">we're constantly exposing its weaknesses and vulnerabilities and let's say nakedness and</p>
<p t="678259" d="6200">There's nothing wrong with criticism, but the thing about Criticism is the purpose of criticism is to separate the wheat from the chaff</p>
<p t="685069" d="2000">It's not to burn everything to the ground</p>
<p t="687470" d="5059">Right, it's to say well. We're going to carefully look at this we're going to carefully differentiate</p>
<p t="692529" d="2700">We're going to keep what's good and we're going to move away from what's bad</p>
<p t="695230" d="4320">But the point of the Criticism isn't to identify everything is bad. It's to</p>
<p t="700129" d="5090">Separate what's good from what's bad so that you can retain. What's good and move towards it and</p>
<p t="705800" d="7880">And to be careless at that is deadly because you're inhabited by the spirit of the father right insofar as you're a cultural</p>
<p t="714079" d="5270">Construction which of course is something that the that the postmodern neo-Marxists are absolutely?</p>
<p t="719809" d="7070">emphatic about you're a cultural construction insofar as you're a cultural construction, then you're inhabited by the spirit of the father and to be</p>
<p t="728059" d="6680">Disrespectful towards that means to undermine the very structure that makes you not all of what you are certainly</p>
<p t="735050" d="1370">Certainly not all of what you are</p>
<p t="736420" d="6719">But a good portion of what you are insofar as you're a socialized cultural entity and if you pull out</p>
<p t="743929" d="6260">If you pull the foundation out from underneath that what do you have left you can hardly manage on your own?</p>
<p t="750860" d="4429">You know it's just not possible. You're a cultural creation. And</p>
<p t="755929" d="2240">so Ham makes this desperate</p>
<p t="758809" d="2420">error and is Careless about</p>
<p t="763009" d="6950">Exposing himself to the vulnerability of his father something like that. He doesn't without sufficient respect. And the judgment is that</p>
<p t="770959" d="6320">not only will he be a slave, but so will all of his descendants, and he's contrasted with the other two sons who I</p>
<p t="778550" d="6259">Suppose are willing to give their father the benefit of the doubt something like that, and so when they see him in a compromising position</p>
<p t="786139" d="2900">they handle it with respect and and and</p>
<p t="789949" d="2000">don't capitalize on it and</p>
<p t="792529" d="5750">Maybe that makes them strong. That's what it seems to me, and so I think that's what that story means</p>
<p t="801220" d="2000">It has something to do with respect</p>
<p t="804310" d="6109">you know and the funny thing about having respect for your culture, and I suppose that's partly why I'm doing the biblical stories is because</p>
<p t="810970" d="2359">They're part of a they're part of my culture</p>
<p t="814240" d="3770">they're part of our culture perhaps, but they're certainly part of my culture and</p>
<p t="819100" d="2000">It seems to me that</p>
<p t="822310" d="4220">it's worthwhile to treat that with respect to see what you can glean from it and</p>
<p t="827530" d="3109">And not kick it when it's down. Let's say</p>
<p t="831910" d="2000">so</p>
<p t="839620" d="5720">and so that's how the story of no ends you know and the thing too is Noah is actually a</p>
<p t="846430" d="5359">Pretty decent incarnation of the Spirit of the father that which I suppose is one of the things that makes hams</p>
<p t="853450" d="6289">Misstep more egregious is that I mean noah just built an ark and got everybody through the flood man</p>
<p t="859740" d="7260">You know it's not so bad, and so maybe the fact that he happened to drink too much wine one day wasn't enough to justify</p>
<p t="867520" d="1680">humiliating him and</p>
<p t="869200" d="3950">You know I don't think it's pushing the limits of symbolic interpretation</p>
<p t="873850" d="3530">To note on a daily basis that we're all contained in an ark</p>
<p t="878170" d="6380">Right, and that's the ark that you could think about that as the ark that's been bequeathed to us by our forefathers. That's the</p>
<p t="885820" d="3590">Tremendous infrastructure that we inhabit that we take for granted</p>
<p t="889960" d="1680">Because it works so well</p>
<p t="891640" d="6049">that protects us from things that we can't even imagine and we don't have to imagine because we're so well protected and</p>
<p t="898300" d="3919">So one of the things that's really struck me hard. I would say about the</p>
<p t="903340" d="5000">Disintegration and corruption of the universities is the absolute ingratitude that goes along with that</p>
<p t="909070" d="1500">You know what?</p>
<p t="910570" d="5239">Criticism as I said it's a fine thing if it's done in the spirit in a proper spirit</p>
<p t="915810" d="5220">And that's the spirit of separating the wheat from the chaff, but it needs to be accompanied by gratitude</p>
<p t="921030" d="7409">And it does seem to me that anyone who lives in in the west in the western culture at this time</p>
<p t="929170" d="3620">in history and in this place and who hasn't</p>
<p t="933449" d="2729">simultaneously grateful for that is is</p>
<p t="936970" d="1070">half-blind</p>
<p t="938040" d="3569">at least because it's never been better than this and</p>
<p t="942160" d="6139">It could be so much worse and it's highly likely that it will be so much worse because for most of human history</p>
<p t="949359" d="2000">So much worse is the norm</p>
<p t="953019" d="2000">so</p>
<p t="958389" d="2000">then there's this little story that</p>
<p t="960970" d="5029">Crops up that seems in some ways unrelated to everything that's gone before it</p>
<p t="966160" d="6919">But I think it's also an extremely profound little story it took me a long time to figure it out. It's the tower of babel</p>
<p t="975699" d="5450">and it came to pass as they journeyed from the east that they found a plain in the land of shinar and dwelt there that's</p>
<p t="982209" d="3619">Noah's Descendants and the whole Earth was of one language and of one speech</p>
<p t="986439" d="5059">And it came to pass as they journeyed from the east that they found a plain in the land of shinar and they dwelt there</p>
<p t="991499" d="1930">And they said to one another</p>
<p t="993429" d="5809">Go let us make brick and burn them thoroughly and they had brick for stone and slime they head for mortar</p>
<p t="1000899" d="6769">So they're establishing a city and they said go let us build a city and a tower whose top may reach</p>
<p t="1007709" d="5659">Unto heaven and let us make a name lest. We be scattered abroad upon the face of the Earth</p>
<p t="1014429" d="1500">and</p>
<p t="1015929" d="4700">the Lord came down to see the city in the tower which the children of men built and</p>
<p t="1021389" d="6350">The Lord said behold the people is one and they all have one language and now this they begin to do</p>
<p t="1027959" d="3890">And now nothing will be restrained from them which they have imagined to do</p>
<p t="1032970" d="4880">Go to let us go down and there confound their language that they may not understand one another's speech</p>
<p t="1039389" d="5960">So the Lord scattered them abroad from thence upon the face of all the earth and they left off to build the city</p>
<p t="1047039" d="5599">therefore is the name of it called babel because the lord did there confound the language of all the Earth and</p>
<p t="1052860" d="2000">From thence did the Lord scattered them abroad</p>
<p t="1055529" d="2000">Upon the face of all the Earth</p>
<p t="1058409" d="5060">It's a very difficult story to understand and it's on the face of it. It doesn't seem to show</p>
<p t="1063470" d="6210">God in a very good light although that happens fairly frequently in the old testament as far as I can tell but</p>
<p t="1071940" d="5689">You know the thing to do if you're reading in the spirit of the text let's say is to remember that</p>
<p t="1078270" d="2300">It's God that you're talking about and so</p>
<p t="1082080" d="2000">Even though you might think that</p>
<p t="1084240" d="2000">He's appearing in a bad light</p>
<p t="1086280" d="5869">Your duty as a reader. I suppose is to assume that you're wrong and that what he did was right</p>
<p t="1092150" d="4080">And then you're supposed to figure out well, how could it possibly be right because the axiomatic</p>
<p t="1096750" d="4820">Presupposition is that it's God and whatever he does is right, and you might say well, you can disagree with that</p>
<p t="1101570" d="4109">And it's it's also the case that some of the people that God talks to in the old testament</p>
<p t="1105930" d="7099">Actually disagree with him and convinced him to alter his actions, but the point still remains that it's God and if he's doing it then</p>
<p t="1113820" d="2000">By definition. There's a good reason</p>
<p t="1120510" d="3800">There's an idea much later that John Milton develops in in</p>
<p t="1125180" d="1380">Paradise lost</p>
<p t="1126560" d="2520">Which is an amazing poem</p>
<p t="1129920" d="7520">And It's it's it's a it's it's  a profound enough poem so that it's almost been incorporated into the biblical structure  I would say so</p>
<p t="1138120" d="2030">the Corpus of Christianity</p>
<p t="1141690" d="2000">Post Milton</p>
<p t="1144540" d="1560">was Saturated by</p>
<p t="1146100" d="4849">the Miltonic stories of Satan's Rebellion none of us in the in the in the</p>
<p t="1151080" d="5900">Biblical texts or it's only hinted at in very brief passages and Milton wrote his poem</p>
<p t="1158400" d="6349">To justify the word the ways of God to man, which is quite an ambition really!</p>
<p t="1165570" d="2030">It's an amazing profound ambition</p>
<p t="1168600" d="2000">To try to produce something</p>
<p t="1170780" d="1860">to produce a literary work</p>
<p t="1172640" d="6140">That justifies being to human beings, because that's what Milton was trying to do, so one of my readers here</p>
<p t="1178790" d="2870">Sent me a link the other day for viewers</p>
<p t="1182250" d="4520">To a work of philosophy by an australian Philosopher whose name I don't remember</p>
<p t="1188100" d="2000">Who basically wrote a book saying that:</p>
<p t="1191070" d="3679">being as such, human experience, is so corrupt and so</p>
<p t="1195450" d="3890">Permeated by suffering that it would be better if it had never existed at all</p>
<p t="1200150" d="2130">sort of the ultimate expression of Nihilism and</p>
<p t="1202950" d="7279">Goethe in in Faust his Mephistopheles who's a Satanic character obviously has that as a credo</p>
<p t="1210510" d="2719">That's that Satan's fundamental motivation is</p>
<p t="1214890" d="6829">His objection to creation itself is that creation is so flawed and so rife with suffering that it would be better if it had never</p>
<p t="1221730" d="3109">existed at all and so that's his motivation for attempting to</p>
<p t="1225810" d="2839">continue to Destroy it but in</p>
<p t="1229320" d="2000">Milton's Paradise lost</p>
<p t="1231600" d="5330">Satan is an intellectual figure, and you see that motif emerged very frequently by the way in</p>
<p t="1237690" d="7699">popular culture, so for example in the lion king the figure of Skaar who's a Satanic figure is also hyper intellectual and</p>
<p t="1246000" d="6260">That's very common that you know it's the evil scientist motif or the or the evil advisor to the king the same motif it</p>
<p t="1252840" d="3680">Encapsulates something about rationality and it what it seems to encapsulate is the idea that</p>
<p t="1257370" d="7910">Rationality like Satan is the highest angel in God's heavenly Kingdom. It's a psychological idea. You know that the most powerful</p>
<p t="1266130" d="5989">Sub element of the human psyche is the intellect and and it's the thing that shines out above all</p>
<p t="1272820" d="3439">within the domain of humanity and maybe across the</p>
<p t="1277380" d="4070">Domain of life itself the human intellect there's something absolutely remarkable about it</p>
<p t="1281450" d="2669">but it has a flaw and the flaw is that it tends to</p>
<p t="1284430" d="3559">Fall in love with its own productions and to assume that their total</p>
<p t="1288810" d="2000">Solzhenitsyn when he was writing the Gulag Archipelago</p>
<p t="1291450" d="2779">had a warning about that with regards to</p>
<p t="1295260" d="7640">totalitarian Ideology, and he said that the price of selling your god-given soul to the entrapments of</p>
<p t="1303620" d="4460">human dogma was slavery and death essentially and</p>
<p t="1308500" d="2000">Satan</p>
<p t="1311840" d="2880">in Milton's Paradise Lost Satan</p>
<p t="1315580" d="1310">decides that</p>
<p t="1316890" d="4430">He can do without the transcendent he can do without God and that's why he foments rebellion</p>
<p t="1322100" d="7140">It's something like that and the consequence of that the immediate consequence from Milton's perspective was that as soon as Satan</p>
<p t="1329850" d="3230">Decided that what he knew was sufficient</p>
<p t="1333670" d="6930">That he could do without the transcendent which he might think about as the domain outside of what you know something like that</p>
<p t="1341090" d="2000">immediately he was in hell and</p>
<p t="1344570" d="4849">When I read Paradise lost I was studying totalitarianism, and I thought you know the poet</p>
<p t="1350450" d="2270">the true Poet like a prophet</p>
<p t="1353390" d="2000">if someone who has</p>
<p t="1355580" d="1920">intimations of the future</p>
<p t="1357500" d="5960">and maybe that's because the poetic mind the philosophical or prophetic mind is a pattern detector and</p>
<p t="1363710" d="5059">And there are people who can detect the underlying it's like the malady of a nation</p>
<p t="1369530" d="5359">Melody is in song the song of a nation and can see how it's going to develop across the centuries you see this you see</p>
<p t="1374890" d="6359">That Nietzsche because Nietzsche for example in the mid you know in 1860 or so. I mean he prophesied</p>
<p t="1381250" d="6150">What was going to happen in the 20th century said that he said specifically that the spectre of Communism would kill</p>
<p t="1388310" d="6079">Millions of people in the 20th century, it's amazing prophecy. He said that in the notes that became will to power and</p>
<p t="1395060" d="6859">Dostoyevsky was of the same sort of mind someone who was in touch enough with the fundamental patterns of</p>
<p t="1403010" d="4400">Human movement that they could extrapolate out into the future and see what was coming</p>
<p t="1407570" d="5179">and I mean some people are very good at detecting patterns you know and and uh</p>
<p t="1414020" d="2000">Milton, I think was of that, sort and</p>
<p t="1416630" d="1080">I</p>
<p t="1417710" d="7159">think he had intimations of what was coming as human rationality became more and more powerful and technology became more and more powerful and the</p>
<p t="1425510" d="3320">Information was that we would produce systems that dispensed with God</p>
<p t="1429710" d="6289">That were completely rational and completely total that would immediately turn everything they touched into something</p>
<p t="1437990" d="1950">indistinguishable from Hell, and</p>
<p t="1439940" d="2000">then Milton's warning was</p>
<p t="1442100" d="2000">embodied in the poem is that</p>
<p t="1444800" d="2000">the rational mind that</p>
<p t="1447860" d="4940">Generates a production and then worships it as if it's absolute immediately occupies hell</p>
<p t="1455420" d="2000">So what does that have to do with the tower of babel?</p>
<p t="1460430" d="2809">we know it back into 2008 when the</p>
<p t="1464450" d="2000">When we had that economic collapse?</p>
<p t="1467090" d="2569">the strange idea emerged politically and that</p>
<p t="1470179" d="2390">was the idea of too big to fail and</p>
<p t="1473149" d="2540">I thought about that idea for a long time because I thought</p>
<p t="1476659" d="5480">There's something deeply wrong with that is one of the things that made Marx wrong</p>
<p t="1483649" d="6830">was Marx believed that capital would flow into the hands of fewer and fewer people and that the</p>
<p t="1491659" d="4520">dissociation between the rich and the poor would become more extreme as capitalism developed and</p>
<p t="1498919" d="6320">Like so many things that Marx said that's it's kind of true. It's kind of true in that</p>
<p t="1506720" d="4460">The distribution of wealth and in fact a distribution of anything, that's produced</p>
<p t="1511640" d="1280">Follows a Pareto</p>
<p t="1512929" d="5331">Pattern and the Pareto Pattern basically is that a small proportion of people end up with the bulk of the goods</p>
<p t="1518260" d="4919">And it isn't just money it's it's anything that people produce creatively</p>
<p t="1524000" d="2270">ends up in that distribution and</p>
<p t="1526789" d="3380">That's actually the economists call that the Matthieu principle</p>
<p t="1530169" d="1990">And they take that from a statement in the new testament</p>
<p t="1532159" d="5989">and the statement is to those who have everything more will be given and from those who have nothing everything will be taken and</p>
<p t="1538490" d="5239">It's it's a map of the manner in which the world manifests itself where</p>
<p t="1544010" d="5269">Human creative production is involved and the map seems to indicate that as you start to produce and you're successful</p>
<p t="1549529" d="3770">The probability that you will continue to be successful or accelerate</p>
<p t="1553520" d="4909">Increases as you're successful and as you fail the probability that you will fail starts to accelerate</p>
<p t="1558500" d="4669">So if your progress to life looks like this or like this</p>
<p t="1563960" d="6229">something like that and the reason that Marx was right was because he noted that as a</p>
<p t="1570649" d="6890">Feature of the capitalist system the reason that he was wrong. Is that it's not a feature that's specific to a capitalist system</p>
<p t="1577760" d="4729">it's a feature that's general to all systems of creative production that are known and</p>
<p t="1582950" d="7190">so it's like a natural law and it's enough of a natural law by the way that the distribution of wealth can be modeled by</p>
<p t="1590480" d="6709">Physical models using the same equations that govern the distribution of gas molecules in a vacuum, so it's a really profound</p>
<p t="1597500" d="2000">It's a fundamentally</p>
<p t="1599510" d="5660">profound observation about the world way the world lays itself out, and it's problematic because if</p>
<p t="1607250" d="2179">resources accrue</p>
<p t="1611180" d="2000">unfairly to a small minority of people</p>
<p t="1613280" d="7099">and there's a natural law like element to that that has to be dealt with from a social perspective because if the</p>
<p t="1621140" d="6169">Inequality becomes too extreme then the whole system will destabilize and so you can have an intelligent</p>
<p t="1627890" d="3349">discussion about how to mitigate the effects of</p>
<p t="1631760" d="2000">the transfer of creative</p>
<p t="1634460" d="2599">production into the hands of a small number of people</p>
<p t="1637760" d="5750">Now the other reason however having said that the other reason that Marx was wrong. There's a number of them</p>
<p t="1644150" d="2149">One is that even though</p>
<p t="1649400" d="2000">creative products end</p>
<p t="1651830" d="5300">Up in the hands of a small number of people it's not the same people consistently across time</p>
<p t="1657130" d="3329">It's the same proportion of people, and that's not the same thing</p>
<p t="1661190" d="4310">you know like imagine that there's water going down a drain and you say well look at the</p>
<p t="1666020" d="5269">Spiral it's permanent, you think well the spiral is permanent, but the water Molecules aren't they're moving through it</p>
<p t="1671320" d="3060">And it's the same in some sense with the pareto distribution</p>
<p t="1674380" d="4949">is that there's a 1% and there's always a 1%, but it's not the same people it's</p>
<p t="1681020" d="2179">the stability of it differs from</p>
<p t="1684410" d="660">culture to culture</p>
<p t="1685070" d="6500">but there's a lot of movement in the upper 1% a tremendous amount of movement and one of the reasons for that movement is that</p>
<p t="1692330" d="4430">things get large and then they get too large and then they collapse and</p>
<p t="1697820" d="1590">so in</p>
<p t="1699410" d="2750">2008 when the politicians said too big to fail</p>
<p t="1703040" d="5000">They got something truly backwards as far as I can tell and that was</p>
<p t="1710870" d="4910">With a reverse the statement was reversed it should have been so big it had to fail</p>
<p t="1716450" d="4670">And that's what I think the story of the tower of babel is about it's it's a warning</p>
<p t="1722150" d="1860">against the</p>
<p t="1724010" d="2000">expansion of the system</p>
<p t="1727220" d="3500">Until it encompasses everything it's a warning against</p>
<p t="1731840" d="2000">Totalitarian presumption so what happens for example</p>
<p t="1734740" d="4319">When people set out to build the tower of babel as they want to build a structure that reaches to heaven</p>
<p t="1739429" d="1801">right so the idea is that</p>
<p t="1741230" d="5059">It can it can it can replace it can replace the role of God</p>
<p t="1746289" d="3540">it's something like that it can erase the distinction between</p>
<p t="1750020" d="4699">Earth and Heaven, and so there's a utopian kind of vision there as well as we can build a structure</p>
<p t="1754720" d="3599">That's so large and encompassing that that</p>
<p t="1758840" d="2000">That it can replace heaven itself</p>
<p t="1762890" d="1590">That's an interesting</p>
<p t="1764480" d="7099">The fact that that doesn't work and that God objects to it is also extraordinarily interesting and it's an indication to me of the unbelievable</p>
<p t="1771860" d="6799">Profundity of these stories. It's like I think one thing we should have learned from the 20th century, but of course didn't was that</p>
<p t="1779210" d="7219">There's something extraordinary dangerous about totalitarian utopian visions. That's something dostoevsky wrote about by the way in his great book</p>
<p t="1787010" d="6709">Notes from Underground because Dostoevsky figured out by the early 1900's that there was something very very</p>
<p t="1794059" d="7400">Pathological about a utopian vision of perfection that it was profoundly anti-human and and notes in notes from underground</p>
<p t="1801460" d="6449">He demolishes the notion of utopia one of the things he says that I loved it's so Brilliant said imagine that you</p>
<p t="1808309" d="2989">brought the Socialist utopia into being and</p>
<p t="1812210" d="3500">dostoyevsky says and that human beings had nothing to do except</p>
<p t="1817220" d="2000">eat</p>
<p t="1819380" d="3260">Drink and busy themselves with the continuation of the species</p>
<p t="1824000" d="4459">He said that the first thing that would happen under circumstances like that</p>
<p t="1828860" d="1230">Would be that</p>
<p t="1830090" d="5420">Human beings would go mad and break the system smash it just so that something unexpected</p>
<p t="1835640" d="3319">And crazy could happen because human beings don't want</p>
<p t="1839809" d="5690">utopian comfort and certainty they want adventure and Chaos and uncertainty and</p>
<p t="1845899" d="4490">so that the very notion of a utopia was anti-human because we're not built for</p>
<p t="1851570" d="1739">static utopia</p>
<p t="1853309" d="2000">we're built for a</p>
<p t="1855679" d="2270">dynamic situation where there's</p>
<p t="1859340" d="4939">Demands placed on us and where there's the optimal amount of uncertainty</p>
<p t="1867110" d="3869">Well, we know what happened in the 20th century as a consequence of the widespread</p>
<p t="1871830" d="2000">promulgation of utopian schemes and</p>
<p t="1874440" d="2000">what happened was</p>
<p t="1876570" d="7040">mayhem on a scale that had never been matched in the entire history of humanity, and that's really saying something because</p>
<p t="1886320" d="2570">There was plenty of Mayhem before the 20th century</p>
<p t="1888890" d="5729">I guess there wasn't as much industrial clout behind it and so so early you</p>
<p t="1895200" d="1440">see</p>

<p t="2031980" d="1980">Mostly what you see</p>
<p t="2033960" d="5270">Menacing humanity is Tiamat she's the dragon of Chaos and so that's nature. It's really</p>
<p t="2039750" d="2000">It's really mother nature</p>
<p t="2041850" d="2000">red in tooth and claw</p>
<p t="2044520" d="2000">but by the time the egyptians come along</p>
<p t="2049260" d="3229">It isn't only nature that threatens humanity</p>
<p t="2052490" d="2910">it's the social structure itself and so the</p>
<p t="2055890" d="5329">egyptians had two deities that represented the social structure and one was Osiris who was</p>
<p t="2061500" d="5929">Like the spirit of the father. He was a great hero who established egypt, but became old and and</p>
<p t="2068220" d="2209">Willfully blind and and and</p>
<p t="2071190" d="1440">and</p>
<p t="2072630" d="3139">senile and he had an evil brother named Seth and</p>
<p t="2076440" d="3560">Seth was always conspiring to overthrow him and</p>
<p t="2081330" d="1200">because</p>
<p t="2082530" d="7219">Osiris ignored him long enough Seth did overthrow chopped him into pieces and distributed all around the kingdom and</p>
<p t="2090720" d="2270">His son Horus had to come back and fight</p>
<p t="2093929" d="2989">Osiris his son Horus had to come back and defeat</p>
<p t="2096919" d="2940">Seth to take the Kingdom back. That's how that story ends</p>
<p t="2099860" d="5250">But the egyptians seem to have realized maybe because they had become bureaucratized to quite a substantial degree</p>
<p t="2105600" d="2780">That it wasn't only nature that threatened</p>
<p t="2109020" d="6050">Humankind it was also the proclivity of human organizations to become too large too unwieldy</p>
<p t="2115710" d="5120">too deceitful and to willfully blind and therefore liable to collapse and</p>
<p t="2121710" d="2870">Again, I see echoes of that in the story of the tower of babel</p>
<p t="2125760" d="1200">so</p>
<p t="2126960" d="2000">It's a calling for</p>
<p t="2130880" d="1510">A</p>
<p t="2132390" d="2000">kind of humility of social engineering</p>
<p t="2136319" d="2900">one of the other things I've learned as a social scientist and</p>
<p t="2141569" d="4670">I've been warned about this by I would say great social scientists that</p>
<p t="2148049" d="2000">You want to be very careful about</p>
<p t="2150420" d="1770">doing large-scale</p>
<p t="2152190" d="5030">experimentation with large scale systems because the probability that if you implement a</p>
<p t="2157740" d="5179">Scheme in a large-scale social system that that scheme will have the result you intended is</p>
<p t="2163799" d="4640">Negligible what will happen will be something that you don't intend and even worse</p>
<p t="2168900" d="3439">something that works at counter purposes to your original intent and</p>
<p t="2173160" d="2810">so and that makes sense because</p>
<p t="2176579" d="2390">If you have a very very complex system</p>
<p t="2178970" d="7079">And you perturb it the probability that you can predict the consequence of the perturbation is extraordinary low obviously</p>
<p t="2187920" d="6919">If the system works though you think you understand it because it works and so you think it's simpler than it actually is and so</p>
<p t="2194839" d="2610">Then you think that your model of it is correct</p>
<p t="2197450" d="4319">and then you think that your manipulation of the model which produces</p>
<p t="2202200" d="6260">The outcome you model will be the outcome that's actually produced in the world that doesn't work at all</p>
<p t="2210150" d="2000">I Thought about that an awful lot</p>
<p t="2213269" d="3920">thinking about how to remediate social systems because obviously they need</p>
<p t="2218339" d="4250">Careful attention and adjustment, and it struck me that the proper</p>
<p t="2226650" d="5659">strategy for implementing social change is to stay within your domain of competence and that</p>
<p t="2233670" d="3889">Requires humility which is a virtue that is never</p>
<p t="2240809" d="4940">Promoted in Modern culture. I would say it's it's a virtue that you can hardly even talk about</p>
<p t="2246569" d="1831">but humility means</p>
<p t="2248400" d="5719">You're probably not as smart as you think you are and you should be careful and so then the question might be well</p>
<p t="2254369" d="5419">Ok you should be careful, but perhaps you still want to do good you want to make some positive changes?</p>
<p t="2259789" d="5490">how can you be careful and do good and then I would say well you try not to step out the boundaries of your</p>
<p t="2265440" d="2300">competence and you start small and you</p>
<p t="2268170" d="5060">start with things that you actually could adjust that you actually do understand that you actually could fix I</p>
<p t="2273660" d="2929">Mentioned to you at one point that one of the things carl jung said was that</p>
<p t="2277829" d="5390">Modern men don't see God because they don't look low enough. It's a very interesting Phrase and</p>
<p t="2283980" d="2000">one of the things that I've been</p>
<p t="2286410" d="1949">Promoting I suppose</p>
<p t="2288359" d="2000">Online is the idea that</p>
<p t="2290730" d="2659">You should restrict your attempts to fix things</p>
<p t="2295050" d="2000">to what's</p>
<p t="2298440" d="1950">at hand</p>
<p t="2300390" d="4219">So there's probably things about you that you could fix right things that you know that aren't right?</p>
<p t="2305250" d="3770">Not anyone else's opinion your own opinion that aren't right you can fix them</p>
<p t="2309020" d="3659">Maybe there's some things that you could adjust in your family that gets hard you</p>
<p t="2312810" d="5299">Have to have your act together a lot before you can start to adjust your family because things can kick back on you really hard</p>
<p t="2318109" d="4500">And you think well it's hard to put yourself together. It's really hard to put your family together</p>
<p t="2322740" d="2060">Why the hell do you think you can put the world together?</p>
<p t="2325680" d="6229">right because obviously the world is more complicated than you and your family and so if you if you're stymied in your attempts</p>
<p t="2331910" d="2969">Even to set your own house in order which of course you are</p>
<p t="2335099" d="4070">Then you would think that what that would do would be to make you very very leery about</p>
<p t="2339990" d="3260">announcing your broad-scale plans for social revolution</p>
<p t="2345450" d="7250">Well, it's a peculiar thing because that isn't how it works because people are much more likely to announce their plans for Broad-scale social revolution</p>
<p t="2352700" d="3300">Than they are to try to set themselves straight or to set their family straight</p>
<p t="2356000" d="5939">And I think the reason for that is that as soon as they try to set themselves straight or their families the system immediately</p>
<p t="2362310" d="5989">kicks back at them right instantly whereas if they announced their plans for large-scale social revolution</p>
<p t="2369150" d="2000">the lag between the</p>
<p t="2371430" d="4699">announcement and the kickback is so long that. They don't recognize that</p>
<p t="2376130" d="7590">there's any error there and so you know you can get away with being wrong if if nothing falls on you for a while, and</p>
<p t="2384510" d="2000">so and it's also</p>
<p t="2386849" d="7160">An incitement to hubris because you can now see your your plans for large-scale social revolution and stand back</p>
<p t="2394010" d="2280">And you don't get hit by lightning and you think well</p>
<p t="2396290" d="6239">I might be right even though you're not you're seriously not right. I might be right and then you think well</p>
<p t="2402960" d="7429">How wonderful is that especially if you could do it without any real effort, and I really do think fundamentally I believe that</p>
<p t="2410390" d="6780">That's what the universities teach students now. That's what they teach them to do. I really believe that and I think it's absolutely appalling</p>
<p t="2418830" d="2179">And I think it's horribly dangerous</p>
<p t="2422610" d="3500">Because it's not that easy to fix things especially if you don't</p>
<p t="2427830" d="2000">especially if you're not committed to it and</p>
<p t="2430080" d="4159">I think you know if you're committed because what you try to do is you try to straighten out your own life first</p>
<p t="2434880" d="5119">and that's enough like there's a I think it's a statement in the new testament that it's I think it's in the new testament that it's</p>
<p t="2440000" d="2610">More difficult to rule yourself than to rule the city</p>
<p t="2443400" d="4310">And that's not a metaphor. It's like all of you. Who've made</p>
<p t="2448680" d="2000">announcements to yourself about</p>
<p t="2450840" d="6169">Changing your diet and going to the gym every January know perfectly well how difficult it is to regulate your own</p>
<p t="2457470" d="4039">impulses and to bring yourself under the control of some</p>
<p t="2463170" d="2000">What would you say?</p>
<p t="2465450" d="2000">well-structured and</p>
<p t="2468150" d="1500">ethical</p>
<p t="2469650" d="1740">attentive</p>
<p t="2471390" d="1980">structure of values</p>
<p t="2473370" d="7189">it's extraordinarily difficult and so people don't do it and instead they wander off, and I think they create towers of Babel and</p>
<p t="2481500" d="3950">the story indicates well those things collapse under their own weight and</p>
<p t="2486090" d="2000">everyone goes their own Direction I</p>
<p t="2489780" d="2000">Think I see that happening</p>
<p t="2492240" d="2000">with the LGBT community I</p>
<p t="2494850" d="7610">think because one of the things I've noticed it's very interesting because the community is in some sense, it's not a community but</p>
<p t="2504210" d="5209">That's a technical error, but it's it's composed of outsiders. Let's say and</p>
<p t="2510780" d="4610">what you notice across the decades is that the acronym list keeps growing and</p>
<p t="2516180" d="5899">I think that's because there's an infinite number of ways to be an outsider and so once you open the door</p>
<p t="2522420" d="3709">to the construction of a group that's characterized by</p>
<p t="2527970" d="4849">Failing to fit into the group then you immediately create a category that's infinitely</p>
<p t="2533160" d="8000">expandable and so I don't know how long the acronym list is now it depends on which acronym list you consult but I've seen</p>
<p t="2541620" d="5029">lists of 10 or more acronyms and one of the things that's happening is that</p>
<p t="2547410" d="2719">The Community is starting to fragment in</p>
<p t="2550770" d="3590">Its in its interior because there is no unity</p>
<p t="2554910" d="3920">once you put a sufficient plurality under the</p>
<p t="2559410" d="1680">sheltering</p>
<p t="2561090" d="2179">structure of a single umbrella say</p>
<p t="2564930" d="4010">the disunity starts to appear within and I think that's also uh</p>
<p t="2570480" d="3739">It's a manifestation of the same issue that this particular story is dealing with</p>
<p t="2579360" d="6260">So that ends. I would say the most archaic stories in the in the bible</p>
<p t="2587370" d="3349">There's something about the flood story and and also the tower of babel</p>
<p t="2590720" d="3870">I think they outline the two fundamental dangers that beset Mankind one is</p>
<p t="2595470" d="2000">the probability that</p>
<p t="2598530" d="3560">Blindness and sin will produce a natural catastrophe or entice one</p>
<p t="2602910" d="7820">That's something modern people are very aware of in principle right because we're all hyper concerned about environmental degradation and catastrophe and so</p>
<p t="2611460" d="2000">That's the continual</p>
<p t="2614280" d="4879">Reactivation of an archetypal idea in our in our unconscious minds that there's something about the way</p>
<p t="2619160" d="3420">we're living that's unsustainable and that will create a</p>
<p t="2623310" d="4489">catastrophe it's so interesting because people believe that firmly and deeply and</p>
<p t="2628920" d="4610">But they don't see the relationship between that and the archetypal stories because it's the same story</p>
<p t="2635910" d="6410">Overconsumption greed all of that is producing an unstable state and nature will rebel and take us down</p>
<p t="2642930" d="3440">You hear that every day in every newspaper and every TV station?</p>
<p t="2646710" d="7820">It's broadcast to you constantly so that idea is presented in in Genesis in the story of Noah and then the other</p>
<p t="2655710" d="4160">Warning that exists in the stories one is Beware of Natural Catastrophe</p>
<p t="2659870" d="4529">That's produced as a consequence of blindness and greed will say the other is</p>
<p t="2665119" d="2000">Beware of</p>
<p t="2668099" d="2000">social structures that overreach</p>
<p t="2670710" d="5629">Because they'll also produce fragmentation and disintegration, and so it's quite remarkable. I think that that</p>
<p t="2677579" d="3199">With at the close of the story of the tower of babel?</p>
<p t="2681539" d="2000">we've got both of</p>
<p t="2683759" d="2870">the permanent existential dangers that</p>
<p t="2687720" d="2000">present themselves to humanity</p>
<p t="2690059" d="2000">already identified</p>
<p t="2697680" d="3349">At the end of the story of Adam and eve. There's like a fall into history</p>
<p t="2701700" d="4639">Right so in one way history begins with the fall, but there's like a second fall</p>
<p t="2706339" d="2669">I think with the flood and the tower of Babel and</p>
<p t="2709529" d="6110">history and even more real sense begins now it begins with this story of Abraham and and it's</p>
<p t="2716220" d="1619">it's</p>
<p t="2717839" d="5239">We're no longer precisely in the realm of the purely mythical. That would be another way of thinking about it</p>
<p t="2723150" d="5239">We have identifiable person who's part of an identifiable tribe is doing identifiable things</p>
<p t="2728390" d="4709">We're in the realm of history and so history begins twice in the old testament I</p>
<p t="2734009" d="2450">suppose it begins again after moses as well, but</p>
<p t="2737940" d="6409">We've moved out of the domain of the purely mythical into the realm of history with with the emergence of the stories about abraham</p>
<p t="2745619" d="1581">This is from aldous huxley</p>
<p t="2747200" d="2429">So the first thing that that I want to talk about in</p>
<p t="2749789" d="4310">relationship to the abrahamic stories is this idea of the experience of God because</p>
<p t="2754829" d="4640">Abraham although quite identifiable as an actual individual is</p>
<p t="2760589" d="6860">Also, characterized by this peculiarity and the peculiarity is that God manifests himself to Abraham</p>
<p t="2768660" d="2599">Both as a voice and but also as a presence</p>
<p t="2771839" d="6979">The stories never describe exactly how god manifests himself except now and then he comes in the form of an angel</p>
<p t="2779039" d="1710">That's fairly concrete</p>
<p t="2780749" d="4460">But it's a funny thing that the author of or authors of the abrahamic story</p>
<p t="2785999" d="1500">seems to take</p>
<p t="2787640" d="2760">The idea that God would make an appearance</p>
<p t="2791760" d="2760">more or less for granted and so</p>
<p t="2795180" d="1660">It's very</p>
<p t="2796849" d="5280">I think the part of the reason that I've struggled so much with the abrahamic stories is because it's so hard to get a handle</p>
<p t="2802130" d="2070">on that and to understand what that might mean and</p>
<p t="2804599" d="3500">So I'm going to hit it from a bunch of different perspectives and let's see if we can</p>
<p t="2808739" d="2000">Come up with some</p>
<p t="2811650" d="5780">Understanding of it the first thing I'll do is tell you a story about a female</p>
<p t="2818700" d="4039">Neurologist whose name escapes me at the moment. She wrote a book called my stroke of insight</p>
<p t="2823950" d="2089">Jill Bolte I think is her name and</p>
<p t="2827130" d="2000">She was a harvard-trained</p>
<p t="2829890" d="2000">She was she had she had</p>
<p t="2832559" d="4640">medical training from Harvard in Neuropsychological function and knew a lot about hemispheric specialization</p>
<p t="2837809" d="4010">we talked a little bit about hemispheric specialization before one of the</p>
<p t="2842609" d="3979">Ways of conceptualizing the difference between the two hemispheres is that the left hemisphere?</p>
<p t="2846839" d="6439">Operates in known territory and the right hemisphere operates in unknown territory. That's one way of thinking about or the left hemisphere operates</p>
<p t="2853799" d="6320">in the orderly domain and the right hemisphere operates in the chaotic domain or the left hemisphere operates in the</p>
<p t="2860430" d="5179">Domain of detail and the right hemisphere operates in the domain of the large picture</p>
<p t="2865950" d="4339">It's something like that now people differ in their neurological wiring, so those are</p>
<p t="2871140" d="2119">Over generalizations, but that's okay</p>
<p t="2873259" d="2610">we live with that for the time being it's certainly not an</p>
<p t="2875940" d="6559">overgeneralization to point out that you do in fact have two hemispheres and that their structures differ and if the connections between them are cut</p>
<p t="2882499" d="6360">Which could happen for example if you had surgery for intractable epilepsy that each hemisphere would be capable of housing its own consciousness</p>
<p t="2889650" d="5479">That's been well documented by a neural neural neurologist in Gazzaniga</p>
<p t="2895380" d="5030">Who did and Sperry who did split brain experiments must be 30 years ago now?</p>
<p t="2901229" d="1231">so</p>
<p t="2902460" d="3799">And we know that the right in the left hemisphere are specialized for different</p>
<p t="2906390" d="5750">Functions the right hemisphere for example seems to be more involved in the generation of negative emotion and the left hemisphere more</p>
<p t="2912719" d="5390">Involved in the generation of positive emotion an approach so the right hemisphere stops you and the left hemisphere moves you forward</p>
<p t="2918779" d="1351">anyways</p>
<p t="2920130" d="1409">Jill</p>
<p t="2921540" d="2340">Bolte I hope I've got that right</p>
<p t="2924600" d="1740">had a stroke</p>
<p t="2926340" d="970">and</p>
<p t="2927310" d="5929">Maintained consciousness during the stroke and analyzed it while it was happening and she was able</p>
<p t="2933880" d="2000">while it was happening to</p>
<p t="2936340" d="3350">hypothesize about what part of her brain was being destroyed and</p>
<p t="2940210" d="5569">what so she had a congenital blood vessel malformation and had an aneurysm and</p>
<p t="2946330" d="2000">It just about killed her</p>
<p t="2949150" d="2000">but she said that</p>
<p t="2951220" d="2000">It affected her left hemisphere</p>
<p t="2953980" d="6500">And she said that she experienced a sense of divine unity as a consequence of the stroke</p>
<p t="2961120" d="6109">because the left hemisphere function was disrupted and destroyed and so she became a right hemisphere dominant and</p>
<p t="2968200" d="4459">her experience of that was the dissolution of the specific ego into the</p>
<p t="2973810" d="6979">Absolute consciousness something like that now that's only a case study, and you don't want to make too much of case studies</p>
<p t="2980790" d="3000">But there is an overwhelming amount of evidence</p>
<p t="2984580" d="2989">that those two kinds of consciousness exist</p>
<p t="2988210" d="1500">one being</p>
<p t="2989710" d="2000">your consciousness of you as a</p>
<p t="2991990" d="4100">localized and specified being and the other being</p>
<p t="2997210" d="1170">this</p>
<p t="2998380" d="1800">capacity to experience</p>
<p t="3000180" d="4459">oceanic dissolution and the sense of the cosmos being one</p>
<p t="3006120" d="4429">Now why we have those capacities for different conscious</p>
<p t="3011370" d="1080">experiences</p>
<p t="3012450" d="3919">Is very difficult to understand. I mean part of me thinks that</p>
<p t="3016950" d="2659">Maybe we have a generic human brain</p>
<p t="3020760" d="2540">it's the brain of the species and</p>
<p t="3023850" d="2000">Allied with that we have a specific</p>
<p t="3025860" d="5090">individual brain and one is the left hemisphere and the other is the right hemisphere the left hemisphere being the</p>
<p t="3031050" d="5600">specific individual brain and usually it's on and working because you obviously have to take care of yourself as a</p>
<p t="3037230" d="2510">specific entity and not as a generalized</p>
<p t="3040290" d="5840">Cosmic phenomena, it's hard to dice celery when you're a generalized cosmic phenomena</p>
<p t="3046380" d="4849">Right so you have to be more pointed than that but but look let's make no mistake about it</p>
<p t="3051960" d="3770">The fact that those different states of consciousness exists is not</p>
<p t="3056190" d="5519">Disputable they can be elicited in all sorts of ways and so</p>
<p t="3062499" d="6080">I'm going to read you something that Aldous Huxley wrote about this back, I think, in 1956 this was after he</p>
<p t="3071799" d="2119">Started his experimentation with mescaline</p>
<p t="3075039" d="6350">The psychedelics were introduced into western culture in the 1950s in a whole bunch of different ways psilocybin mushrooms</p>
<p t="3081759" d="3260">LsD. I was discovered right at the end of World War two</p>
<p t="3085869" d="2000">Was discovered by accident actually?</p>
<p t="3088390" d="6649">laboratory Sandoz labs the guy who discovered it Albert Hofmann had spilled some on his hands you can absorb it through your skin and</p>
<p t="3095619" d="7159">He was biking home and had the world's first LSD trip which was somewhat of a shock to him and then to the entire world</p>
<p t="3104499" d="3229">Huxley who was a great literary figure, a real genius</p>
<p t="3109539" d="2030">experimented with mescaline in the late fifties and</p>
<p t="3112390" d="5779">He wrote a book called the doors of perception which had a huge impact on the emerging psychedelic culture both on</p>
<p t="3118419" d="7460">The East coast at Harvard and on the West coast with Ken Kesey and his merry pranksters the people who popularized LSD</p>
<p t="3125880" d="4020">That's all documented in a book called the electric Kool-Aid acid test; Which I would highly recommend</p>
<p t="3130329" d="4280">It's Tom Wolfe it's a brilliant book on the east coast it was timothy leary</p>
<p t="3134609" d="6179">I had timothy leary's old job at Harvard. So that was kind of cool. You know in a warped way</p>
<p t="3141309" d="2419">So I met people there who knew him</p>
<p t="3144489" d="3979">Who didn't think much of them also, but who did know him but</p>
<p t="3149109" d="3919">Huxley had this mescaline experience, and it transported him to this</p>
<p t="3154089" d="1280">alternative consciousness</p>
<p t="3155369" d="6359">And he said that during his mescaline experience that the entire world glowed from within like if there was an inner light</p>
<p t="3161890" d="4519">like a paradisal inner light and that everything was deeply meaningful and</p>
<p t="3167140" d="6469">Symbolically suggestive and overwhelming and beautiful and timeless so he had an experience of divine</p>
<p t="3174249" d="5330">Eternity I suppose is the most straightforward way to to put that and we know perfectly well that</p>
<p t="3180009" d="5989">the psychedelic drugs that all share the same chemical structure they interact with the brain chemical called Serotonin</p>
<p t="3186609" d="1920">Which is a very very fundamental?</p>
<p t="3188529" d="2510">Neurotransmitter they all have approximately the same</p>
<p t="3192249" d="1961">range of effects</p>
<p t="3194210" d="1859">Although those effects are very</p>
<p t="3196069" d="4910">There's a very large multitude of effects that sort of exist underneath that umbrella</p>
<p t="3203180" d="2000">Huxley was</p>
<p t="3207079" d="5750">staggered by his mescaline experience he he didn't really know what to make of it, and I think that that's</p>
<p t="3213470" d="2659">the common experience of people who have</p>
<p t="3216950" d="2869">exceptionally profound psychedelic experiences and I'll</p>
<p t="3220640" d="3770">Tell you some documentation about that in a moment, but he spent quite a long time</p>
<p t="3225050" d="5959">Trying to come to grips with what this might mean from an intellectual perspective and huxley had a great brain</p>
<p t="3231010" d="3869">I mean someone was going to wrestle with the problem like that. He was a good candidate</p>
<p t="3234880" d="2910">He must have had a verbal IQ of 180. I mean he's</p>
<p t="3238460" d="6889">his books are incredibly literate Incredible credible mastery of language and complexity of characterization and and</p>
<p t="3245960" d="2000">intellectual Discourse really remarkable</p>
<p t="3249260" d="4939">So this is what Huxley had to say after his mescaline experience he talked about heaven and hell</p>
<p t="3254200" d="4169">and he talked about that in reference to bad trips essentially because</p>
<p t="3258920" d="5510">it was known by that point that a Psychedelic experience could transport you to an</p>
<p t="3264770" d="2959">Ecstatic domain of Divine revelation</p>
<p t="3267730" d="6959">but could take you to the worst imaginable place as well huxley was very interested in why you would even have the capacity for</p>
<p t="3275000" d="4520">Experiences like that and which I think is a very good question and it's completely unanswered question</p>
<p t="3279520" d="4559">I mean, we don't know much about consciousness and we know even less about psychedelics</p>
<p t="3284079" d="5219">I would say they are an absolute mystery. I don't think we understand them in the least</p>
<p t="3290630" d="5479">Huxley did a good job of starting to at least map out the mysteries of the terrain he said like the earth of a hundred</p>
<p t="3296109" d="6660">Years ago our mind still has its darkest Africa's its unmapped Borneo's and Amazonian basin in</p>
<p t="3303170" d="3860">Relation to the Fauna of these regions. We are not yet zoologists</p>
<p t="3307460" d="4550">We are mere naturalist sand collectors of specimens the fact is unfortunate</p>
<p t="3312010" d="2549">But we have to accept it we have to make the best of it</p>
<p t="3315559" d="7820">However, lowly the work of the collector must be done before we can proceed to the higher scientific tasks of classification analysis experiment and theory</p>
<p t="3323380" d="5940">Making like the giraffe and the duck-billed platypus the creatures inhabit these remoter regions of the mind</p>
<p t="3330380" d="1860">Are exceedingly improbable.</p>
<p t="3332240" d="2719">Nevertheless they exist they're facts of observation</p>
<p t="3335570" d="5060">And as such they cannot be ignored by anyone who is honestly trying to understand the world in which he lives</p>
<p t="3345920" d="2570">when psychiatrists started to study LSD that</p>
<p t="3349460" d="4189">was mostly in the late 50s and running forward from that they thought about</p>
<p t="3354560" d="7849">The drug as a psychedelic which was a chemical substance that would induce psychosis, but that turned out to not be true</p>
<p t="3362930" d="2630">not with the psychedelics because</p>
<p t="3366680" d="2000">schizophrenics were given LSD and</p>
<p t="3369230" d="2000">The schizophrenics reported that</p>
<p t="3371480" d="3169">while the experience experience was certainly</p>
<p t="3375350" d="3830">extraordinarily strange, it wasn't like being schizophrenic and</p>
<p t="3379730" d="6979">then it was found later that if you gave schizophrenics amphetamines that made them worse in fact you can induce a</p>
<p t="3387170" d="4100">Paranoid psychosis in a normal person by overdosing them with amphetamines</p>
<p t="3391400" d="3770">So whatever the hallucinogens are the psychedelics are doing</p>
<p t="3395360" d="5660">It's not the same thing as mania and it's not the same thing as schizophrenia not at all</p>
<p t="3403490" d="2000">so</p>
<p t="3409930" d="7729">So you can't just write the experience off as an induced psychosis, whatever it is</p>
<p t="3419170" d="3859">Independent of its utility or lack thereof it's not that</p>
<p t="3424510" d="2000">Now can be induced by drugs</p>
<p t="3427450" d="4399">Can be induced by deprivation right? I mean there are accounts throughout history of people</p>
<p t="3432640" d="2000">putting themselves in Extreme</p>
<p t="3434650" d="6739">Physiological situations in order to induce transformations of consciousness fasting is one of the routes to doing that</p>
<p t="3442090" d="2000">Dancing is another route</p>
<p t="3444190" d="7489">Isolation prolonged periods of isolation will also do it now you could say that exposing yourself to any of those in excess</p>
<p t="3452860" d="1920">produces a state that's</p>
<p t="3454780" d="2000">indistinguishable from illness and</p>
<p t="3457960" d="5719">That there's no reason to assume that the phenomena that are associated with illness have any</p>
<p t="3464080" d="3600">Utility Whatsoever although, it's interesting to me that</p>
<p t="3470460" d="6020">A Disrupted consciousness can Produce coherent experiences. It's not exactly what you expect</p>
<p t="3476489" d="3051">It was just an illness you know if you develop say a high fever</p>
<p t="3480640" d="1830">your experience</p>
<p t="3482470" d="6830">Isn't transcendent and coherent its fragmented and pathologized and and the difference</p>
<p t="3489300" d="2130">I think is quite distinct although</p>
<p t="3491430" d="4109">We don't only we don't have to only speculate about that because there's been enough experimental work done</p>
<p t="3495540" d="3120">Now with hallucinogens and psychedelics to indicate that</p>
<p t="3499150" d="5119">The notion that what they produce is something that's only akin to Pathology is wrong</p>
<p t="3504820" d="1230">because</p>
<p t="3506050" d="5490">It's not a matter of opinion at this point in the sequence of scientific and historical</p>
<p t="3511540" d="2380">Investigation in fact there was a large-scale study done</p>
<p t="3514560" d="6060">Ten Years ago? five years ago? of two hundred thousand people who had experimented with pSychedelics</p>
<p t="3520620" d="6380">And they were mentally and physically healthier than people who hadn't on virtually every parameter they examined in</p>
<p t="3527320" d="2000">fact the rate of</p>
<p t="3529380" d="4900">Flashbacks, you've heard of LSD flashbacks mostly a hypothetical phenomena</p>
<p t="3534300" d="6160">But the rate of self-reported flashbacks was higher among the non psychedelic users than among the psychedelic users</p>
<p t="3541400" d="6140">so that was very interesting was a huge study now it might be you could say that those who had experimented with</p>
<p t="3547760" d="6949">Psychedelics were prone to be healthier to begin with but he that still contradicts the Pathology argument</p>
<p t="3554710" d="3810">So it doesn't matter either way the Pathology argument is contradicted</p>
<p t="3559280" d="2000">now,</p>
<p t="3564110" d="3379">oh I did put that in it was Dr. Jill Bolte Taylor</p>
<p t="3568430" d="2180">This is what she said about her stroke I</p>
<p t="3571280" d="5270">Remember that first day of the stroke with terrific bittersweetness in the absence of the normal functioning of my left</p>
<p t="3576770" d="7610">Orientation association area my perception of my physical boundaries was no longer limited to where my skin met air. I felt like a genie</p>
<p t="3585080" d="2300">Liberated from its bottle it's good metaphor</p>
<p t="3588860" d="4099">The energy of my spirit seemed to flow like a great whale gliding through a sea of silent</p>
<p t="3593210" d="3770">Euphoria the absence of Physical Boundary was one of glorious bliss</p>
<p t="3600410" d="4489">Recently this Dr. Roland Griffith I</p>
<p t="3607010" d="6050">met him once at a conference in San Francisco surprised surprised a</p>
<p t="3614600" d="6229">Conference on awe and this was just when he was embarking on his experiments with psilocybin which were the first experiments on</p>
<p t="3621620" d="2000">hallucinogens that were permitted by the</p>
<p t="3624020" d="6620">National Institute of Mental Health in some three four decades he had to be very careful to</p>
<p t="3630920" d="7430">Lay out the scientific protocols so that the ethics committees would approve the experiments and so that the federal funding agencies would</p>
<p t="3638570" d="3770">also allow the experiments to go through he started to experiment with</p>
<p t="3643460" d="1980">psilocybin and</p>
<p t="3645440" d="2570">He's found a number of and published a number of very interesting</p>
<p t="3649970" d="6290">Results one was that a single psilocybin trip</p>
<p t="3657530" d="1560">and I</p>
<p t="3659090" d="2000">specified trip because</p>
<p t="3661100" d="5060">Sometimes when people take psilocybin out the doses that griffith uses. They don't have a psychedelic experience</p>
<p t="3667100" d="7040">Most people who take the dose do but not everyone those who take the dose and don't have the mystical experience don't</p>
<p t="3675350" d="4909">Experience the consequences of taking the drug and the consequences can be quite profound</p>
<p t="3680510" d="6080">So one consequence is that if you have the mystical experience that's associated with psilocybin ingestion</p>
<p t="3687410" d="2000">You're liable to</p>
<p t="3690110" d="5300">Represent that to others and yourself as one of the two or three most experienced important experiences of your entire life</p>
<p t="3696440" d="5030">So that would be at the same level as the birth of your child or your marriage</p>
<p t="3701540" d="4459">let's say assuming that those were transcendent experiences, but that's</p>
<p t="3707360" d="4040">But that's how people describe them so that's that's very interesting in and of itself</p>
<p t="3713720" d="1290">then</p>
<p t="3715010" d="5840">the next thing that griffith another thing that griffith reported was that one year after a</p>
<p t="3722000" d="4100">Psilocybin dose a single psilocybin dose profound enough to induce a mystical experience</p>
<p t="3726770" d="1440">the trait</p>
<p t="3728210" d="4129">openness of the participants had increased one standard deviation</p>
<p t="3732470" d="7339">Which is a tremendous amount and so it looked like one dose produced a permanent neurological and psychological transformation now</p>
<p t="3739810" d="2489">You know I'm not saying that that's a good thing</p>
<p t="3742940" d="3799">I'm not saying that because I don't think that openness is a</p>
<p t="3748880" d="6349">Untroubled blessing, but it's certainly a testament to the unbelievable potency of the of the drugs</p>
<p t="3755990" d="5270">There's about a 10% chance by the way with psilocybin ingestion of a trip to hell</p>
<p t="3761260" d="7770">and so that's certainly something very much worth considering when you're thinking about the potential effects of this kind of</p>
<p t="3769820" d="2000">experience</p>
<p t="3774320" d="7340">so the the mystical experience produced by psilocybin is rated by people as the most profound among the most profound experience of their life as</p>
<p t="3781910" d="2030">life-Changing it produces permanent personality</p>
<p t="3784520" d="4070">transformations eighty-five percent success in smoking cessation with a single dose</p>
<p t="3789740" d="7550">Right that's another thing that griffiths demonstrated now that is mind boggling because there are chemical treatments for smoking cessation</p>
<p t="3799340" d="2300">bupropion is one it</p>
<p t="3803000" d="4010">Reduces craving to some degree, but its success rate is</p>
<p t="3807650" d="2000">Nowhere Near 85%</p>
<p t="3809990" d="2510">certainly not with a single dose and</p>
<p t="3813380" d="1530">so</p>
<p t="3814910" d="6560">We don't understand how it can be that that occurs, but it's nicely documented by griffiths team in this</p>
<p t="3823339" d="3560">Experiment he gave psilocybin to people who are dying of cancer</p>
<p t="3829820" d="4279">cancer patients often develop Chronic clinically significant symptoms of depression and anxiety</p>
<p t="3834710" d="7879">Previous studies suggest that psilocybin may decrease depression and anxiety in cancer patients aldous huxley took LSD on his deathbed by the way</p>
<p t="3843320" d="3169">so the idea that there was something about</p>
<p t="3847790" d="2569">psychedelic substances that could</p>
<p t="3852050" d="7549">Buffer people against the catastrophes of mortality is an idea. That's as old as experimentation with the drug itself</p>
<p t="3860780" d="7639">the effects of psilocybin were studied in 51 cancer patients with life threatening diagnosis and symptoms of depression and/or anxiety</p>
<p t="3869329" d="2000">unsurprisingly</p>
<p t="3874880" d="7860">I don't really know if it's reasonable to describe the emotional state of people diagnosed with cancer of uncertain Prognosis or</p>
<p t="3883340" d="3460">Mortal significance as depression precisely</p>
<p t="3887300" d="4639">You know you know what I mean is that if you go to the doctor and he tells you that you have intractable</p>
<p t="3892490" d="1440">fatal cancer</p>
<p t="3893930" d="5209">The normative response is to be rather upset and anxious about that and so it</p>
<p t="3899630" d="4640">One of the things that bothers me about clinical psychiatry and clinical psychology is the automatic</p>
<p t="3904700" d="4760">Presupposition that even overwhelming states of negative emotion are properly categorized as depression</p>
<p t="3909460" d="5969">I don't think you're depressed when you get a cancer diagnosis. I don't think that's the right way to think about it</p>
<p t="3915430" d="1770">I think that you have a big problem</p>
<p t="3917200" d="6360">And it's not surprising that you're overwhelmed by negative emotion and to think about that as a psychiatric malfunction is a major error</p>
<p t="3924140" d="1679">but anyways</p>
<p t="3925819" d="2360">It's a side issue with regards to this study</p>
<p t="3930470" d="5420">the effects of psilocybin were studied in 51 cancer patients with life threatening diagnosis and symptoms of depression</p>
<p t="3936200" d="4729">And/or anxiety I cannot imagine how they got this through an ethics committee. It's just</p>
<p t="3941570" d="7250">We're going to take people who have uncertain diagnosis of cancer that are potentially life-threatening, and we're going to give them psychedelics. It's like</p>
<p t="3949400" d="5270">But they did it they did it and I think it's a testament to griffiths stature as a researcher that</p>
<p t="3955280" d="2000">That that was allowable</p>
<p t="3957770" d="5540">This is a randomized double-blind crossover trial very carefully designed clinical investigation</p>

<p t="4009070" d="7310">The Hallmark of a well-designed study because they didn't rely on a single source of information for the outcome data right they got self reports</p>
<p t="4016380" d="1570">That's fine, but they had</p>
<p t="4017950" d="3469">Relatively objective observers also Gathered data at the same time</p>

<p t="4179630" d="6350">Now why am I telling you all this well? I'm telling you for a variety of reasons one is the first is</p>
<p t="4186740" d="2000">Make no mistake about it</p>
<p t="4189020" d="7399">human beings have the capacity for forms of consciousness that are radically unlike our normative forms of consciousness and</p>
<p t="4197210" d="3589">the evidence that those alternative forms of consciousness are</p>
<p t="4201980" d="1110">purely</p>
<p t="4203090" d="7280">Pathological which is the simplest explanation right?  You perturb the system it produces Pathology that's negative that is the simplest explanation</p>
<p t="4210710" d="1890">the Evidence for that is</p>
<p t="4212600" d="2000">weak at Best</p>
<p t="4214610" d="2870">Leaving out the bad trip issue which which is non-trivial</p>
<p t="4218150" d="6799">the empirical evidence as it accrues in fact seems to suggest that the consequence of mystical</p>
<p t="4225170" d="3919">positive mystical experiences associated with psychedelic intake is</p>
<p t="4229670" d="5120">overwhelmingly positive even in extreme situations, and you really can't find a more extreme situation than</p>

<p t="4243100" d="6599">But it's kind of in the ballpark and so the fact that even under circumstances like that. There is the overwhelming</p>
<p t="4250310" d="4040">Probability that the experience would be positive because that's another thing you wouldn't expect you know</p>
<p t="4254840" d="4850">Even from some of the earlier earliest discussions about psychedelic use that were put forth by people</p>
<p t="4260330" d="2000">including Timothy Leary</p>
<p t="4262699" d="3590">Describing the importance of set right so that the early experimenters</p>
<p t="4267050" d="1439">noted that</p>

<p t="4270520" d="6330">and you were in a bad state or in a bad place that that was one of the precursors to a bad trip that the</p>
<p t="4276850" d="2399">negative emotion that you entered the</p>
<p t="4279800" d="6950">experience with could be magnified tremendously by the by the chemical substance and so that it was necessary to</p>

<p t="4304960" d="7560">And they still the vast majority of them had a positive experience and the positive experience experience had long lasting positive consequences</p>
<p t="4313070" d="2000">so</p>
<p t="4315290" d="2000">so the case that</p>
<p t="4317330" d="2989">the transcendent experience is not real</p>
<p t="4321050" d="1950">That's wrong</p>
<p t="4323000" d="6920">It's real. now, We don't know what that means because it actually challenges to some degree our concepts of what two dudes real</p>
<p t="4330950" d="3260">But it's certainly well within the realm of normative human experience</p>
<p t="4334730" d="4759">So it's part of the human capacity and you know there's been other neurological experiments too. There's</p>
<p t="4340130" d="5240">there's a researcher Canadian researcher if I remember correctly who invented something he called the God helmet and</p>
<p t="4345920" d="7339">It used Electromagnetic stimulation brain stimulation to induce mystical experiences now</p>
<p t="4353260" d="4950">I don't remember what part of the brain. He was shutting off or activating with that particular Gadget, but</p>
<p t="4359690" d="3379">And you know there's also. There's all sorts of other</p>
<p t="4364340" d="3229">indications of this sort of thing that have cropped up in other</p>
<p t="4369110" d="2180">domains of the Neurological literature for example</p>
<p t="4372170" d="3410">It's very common for people who are epileptic to have</p>
<p t="4376400" d="2000">religious experiences as</p>
<p t="4378410" d="5689">part of the prodrome to the actual seizure that was the case with dostoyevsky for example who had</p>
<p t="4385160" d="4189">Incredibly intense religious experiences that would culminate an epileptic seizure</p>
<p t="4389350" d="5759">and he said that they were of sufficient quality that he would give up his whole life to have had them and</p>
<p t="4395570" d="2000">the funny thing too is that</p>
<p t="4397610" d="4160">In my reading of dostoevsky at least is that I think that</p>
<p t="4402320" d="3950">epileptic seizures and the associated mystical experiences were part of what made him a</p>
<p t="4407030" d="1310">Transcendently Brilliant author</p>
<p t="4408340" d="7530">I don't think that he would have broken through into the domains of insight that he possessed without those strange neurological experiences</p>
<p t="4416450" d="4850">And it was certainly not the case that his epilepsy or the experiences that were associated with it</p>
<p t="4422360" d="6320">Produced what you might describe as an impairment in his cognitive functions quite the contrary at least that's how it looks to me</p>
<p t="4433099" d="2000">here's another</p>
<p t="4435349" d="1941">Here's another something worth considering</p>
<p t="4437290" d="4349">And I don't know how important it is but it might be really important it depends on how important</p>
<p t="4441639" d="3870">This is something that carl jung said so depends on how important jung is</p>
<p t="4446179" d="2000">now freud</p>
<p t="4448429" d="3590">Established the field of psychoanalysis and with it</p>
<p t="4452690" d="2000">investigation I would say</p>
<p t="4455210" d="5870">Rigorous investigation into the contents of the unconscious a modern psychologists and psychiatrists like to</p>
<p t="4462530" d="3859">What would you say? denigrate freud, but I think there's a reason for that</p>
<p t="4466389" d="1181">I think that freud's</p>
<p t="4467570" d="7339">Fundamental insights were so profound and so valuable that they got immediately absorbed into our culture and now they seem self-evident and so that all</p>
<p t="4474909" d="2000">That's left of freud is his errors</p>
<p t="4477110" d="4040">You know because we believed everything else. We believe all the profound things he discovered</p>
<p t="4481190" d="4969">We just take them for granted and so we don't believe the things that he said that weren't quite on the money</p>
<p t="4486159" d="2850">And that's all we credit with him with now</p>
<p t="4489050" d="6319">But he was certainly the first person who brought up the idea of the unconscious in a in a rigorous manner</p>
<p t="4495369" d="6270">And he was the first person to do a rigorous examination of dreams the interpretation of dreams is a great book</p>
<p t="4501639" d="5970">it's well worth reading and he was the first person to note that people were in some sense inhabited by</p>
<p t="4508340" d="4490">subpersonalities that had a certain degree of autonomy and and and independent life</p>
<p t="4513170" d="3410">Brilliant observation the cognitive psychologists haven't caught up with that at all yet</p>
<p t="4520460" d="7399">Jung was profoundly affected by freud jung was profoundly affected by Nietzsche and by freud those were his two main intellectual</p>
<p t="4529280" d="2810">Influences, I don't think one more than the other</p>
<p t="4534830" d="2119">He split with freud on the religious issue</p>
<p t="4537199" d="3020">That was what caused the disruption in their relationship</p>
<p t="4540219" d="5700">And I think it's an extremely interesting historical occurrence and it might be of profound significance</p>
<p t="4547099" d="6500">freud believed that the fundamental myths of the human being was the Oedipal myth, and the Eda pole myths</p>
<p t="4554420" d="6350">From a broader perspective is a failed hero story, so the Oedipal myth is the myth of a man who?</p>
<p t="4561409" d="2360">Develops who grows up, but then</p>
<p t="4564469" d="1361">accidentally</p>
<p t="4565830" d="7589">becomes too close to his mother sleeps with her. He doesn't know who she is and as a consequence blinds himself and there's a</p>
<p t="4574120" d="4819">There's a there's a warning about human development gone wrong in that story</p>
<p t="4578940" d="4140">and I think that freud put his finger on it extraordinarily well because</p>
<p t="4583540" d="6560">human beings have a very long period Of dependency and one of the things that you do see in clinical practice is that</p>
<p t="4590350" d="2509">many People's problems are</p>
<p t="4594010" d="7129">Associated with their inability to break free of their family like they're consumed by the family drama right they can't get Beyond</p>
<p t="4601140" d="2129">What happened to them in their family?</p>
<p t="4603270" d="2640">They're stuck in the past. It's and that's</p>
<p t="4606400" d="5450">That's equivalent symbolically speaking you might say to the idea of being too close to your mother of</p>
<p t="4612370" d="2000">the Boundaries being</p>
<p t="4614590" d="4040">Improperly specified and that happens far more often than anyone would like to think</p>
<p t="4619900" d="2150">As I said freud thought it was a universal</p>
<p t="4623770" d="1440">but Jung</p>
<p t="4625210" d="6229">See he had a different idea and his idea was that it wasn't the failed hero story. That was the universal human myth</p>
<p t="4631480" d="7609">it was the successful hero story, and that's a big difference like it's seriously a big difference because</p>
<p t="4640090" d="2030">the successful Hero's story is</p>
<p t="4642670" d="3620">Remembering sleeping beauty you may remember this in the disney movie</p>
<p t="4646630" d="5300">The Evil queen traps the prince in a dungeon, and she's not going to let him out till he's old right</p>
<p t="4651930" d="5640">And so there's this comical scene where she's down in the dungeon. He's all in chains, and she's laughing at him</p>
<p t="4658090" d="3080">telling him what his future is going to be like it's quite evil and</p>
<p t="4662230" d="1170">you know she</p>
<p t="4663400" d="6020">Paints this wonderful picture of him being freed in like 80 years and hobbling out of the castle on his his horse</p>
<p t="4669420" d="6600">That's old it can barely stand up in him with Grey hair and you know she and she recites this story of his eventual</p>
<p t="4676540" d="7189">Triumphant departure from the castle as a old and decrepit man and she has a great laugh about it, and it's nice</p>
<p t="4683730" d="4709">You know it's a real punchy story. It's really something wonderful for children. That's story and</p>
<p t="4690730" d="2000">he gets free of the of</p>
<p t="4693340" d="1710">the</p>
<p t="4695050" d="3679">Shackles and the things that free em are three little female fairies?</p>
<p t="4698730" d="7290">It's the positive aspect of the feminine that frees him from the dungeon, so it's very interesting and very accurate from a psychological perspective</p>
<p t="4706020" d="6359">it's the negative element of the feminine that encapsulates him in the dungeon and suppose development of the feminine would freeze him and</p>
<p t="4712750" d="4369">and then he has a the queen the evil queen is not very happy when he</p>
<p t="4717430" d="6709">Escapes, you may remember that she stands on top of her castle tower and starts to spin off Cosmic Sparks</p>
<p t="4724230" d="1750">I mean, she's quite the creature</p>
<p t="4725980" d="6709">enveloped in flame, and then she turns into a dragon and she then the prince has to fight with her in order to</p>
<p t="4733930" d="3919">Make contact with sleeping beauty and and awaken her from her</p>
<p t="4738520" d="3889">comatose existence as her unconscious existence and</p>
<p t="4745510" d="5899">That's a brilliant, It's a brilliant representation of a successful hero myth. He</p>
<p t="4752710" d="2000">He doesn't end up</p>
<p t="4755140" d="6380">staying in an unholy relationship with his mother let's say he escapes and</p>
<p t="4762250" d="4069">then conquers the worst thing that can be imagined and</p>
<p t="4767050" d="7370">Is Noble by that and not as a consequence, He's able to wake the slumbering feminine from its coma and</p>
<p t="4775420" d="1460">That's a Jungian story</p>
<p t="4776880" d="5640">And that's the story that he juxtaposed against freud see freud thought of religious phenomena</p>
<p t="4782890" d="5660">As part of an occult tide that would be they would drown rational rationality</p>
<p t="4788620" d="3260">that's why freud was so dominant Lee anti-religious and</p>
<p t="4792490" d="2000">Jung thought no</p>
<p t="4794890" d="5149">It's not the case you're throwing the baby out with the bathwater. There's something profound and</p>
<p t="4800890" d="4399">Central to the Hero myth and Jungian Clinical work</p>
<p t="4805930" d="3770">is essentially the awakening of the hero myth in the</p>

<p t="4814720" d="6290">conceptualize yourself as that which can confront Chaos and triumph and that that's associated with an</p>

<p t="4830890" d="2000">You know I'm a skeptical person</p>
<p t="4833310" d="2520">I'm a very very skeptical person and I've</p>
<p t="4836800" d="3289">Tried with every trick. I have to put a</p>
<p t="4840640" d="6140">Lever underneath Jung story and lift it up and and disrupt it and I I can't do it I</p>
<p t="4847360" d="3560">Think he was right and that freud was wrong. I mean I have great respect for freud</p>
<p t="4850920" d="5520">I think he got the program problem diagnosed very very nicely and in my clinical work I</p>
<p t="4856720" d="6500">See the phenomena that freud described emerged continually constantly that the best if you're interested in that</p>
<p t="4863530" d="2539">There's a documentary you should watch. I may have mentioned it before</p>
<p t="4866070" d="3150">I think it's the best documentary ever made certainly the best one</p>
<p t="4869220" d="2000">I've ever seen it's called crumb</p>
<p t="4871360" d="7430">And it's about an underground cartoonist Robert crumb who who is part of a hippie movement and although he hated hippies</p>
<p t="4879430" d="4969">He was part of the hippie movement in the 60s in San Francisco and started the entire underground comic</p>
<p t="4885700" d="3409">What? culture that manifested itself eventually in in</p>
<p t="4889780" d="2000">graphic novels, there's quite a</p>

<p t="4893530" d="4549">from the perspective of popular art and a very very intelligent man and</p>
<p t="4898300" d="4609">Also, I would say a hero although a very bent and depraved and warped one</p>
<p t="4903670" d="7700">Someone very acutely aware of his own shadow and the documentary outlines his attempts to escape from his</p>
<p t="4912010" d="2000">absolutely dreadful mother and</p>

<p t="4998949" d="3080">Jung split with freud on the issue of</p>

<p t="5052100" d="3460">He wrote two books. He wrote one called the origins and history of consciousness</p>
<p t="5055650" d="4069">Which is a description of the development of consciousness out of unconsciousness</p>
<p t="5060630" d="4219">Using the hero myth as a...</p>
<p t="5064849" d="6360">what would you say? as a as an interpretive Skeleton, so Neumann viewed the hero myth as</p>
<p t="5071760" d="4760">The dramatized story of the emergence of human consciousness out of the surrounding</p>
<p t="5076949" d="6770">Unconsciousness in which it was embedded the struggle for consciousness the struggle of consciousness upward towards the light like a lotus flower</p>
<p t="5084030" d="5180">Struggles up through the muck and and the water to to lay itself on the surface of the</p>
<p t="5089309" d="5959">Water and bloom and reveal the Buddha which is of course what the lotus flower does from the symbolic perspective?</p>
<p t="5096000" d="1889">for Neumann</p>
<p t="5097889" d="5150">The Hero's story was the story of the development success development of consciousness and the origins of consciousness</p>
<p t="5103710" d="2419">The origins and history of consciousness is a great book</p>
<p t="5107130" d="1500">interestingly</p>
<p t="5108630" d="2120">Camille Paglia wrote read</p>
<p t="5111719" d="2720">The origins and history of consciousness. She's one of the few</p>
<p t="5115469" d="7220">Mainstream intellectuals that I've ever encountered who read that and commented on it and she believed that it would be sufficient</p>
<p t="5123960" d="6620">antidote to postmodern denigration of literature, she thought it was that powerful of work and I</p>
<p t="5132119" d="2210">Believe that I I think it's a remarkable</p>
<p t="5134969" d="5930">Book carl jung wrote the foreword to that book and he said in the foreword that it was the book that he wished he would</p>
<p t="5140900" d="3779">Have written so sort of like Jung he. Wrote I don't remember how many volumes</p>
<p t="5146400" d="4549">dozens of very thick difficult volumes was like Neumann was able to</p>
<p t="5153270" d="2750">What? Distill those into a single</p>
<p t="5156449" d="1221">volume statement</p>
<p t="5157670" d="5189">And so I would also say if you're interested in Jung the best book to read is the origins and history of consciousness</p>
<p t="5162860" d="4799">It's the best intro into into the Jungian world seems very difficult to</p>
<p t="5168869" d="6200">very difficult to understand it requires a real shift of perspective in order to understand what he's talking about and</p>
<p t="5176219" d="2000">Neumann wrote another book called the great mother</p>
<p t="5178860" d="3169">Which is a little bit more specialized in some sense</p>
<p t="5182030" d="4890">but it's also extremely interesting because it flashes out the archetype of Chaos and</p>
<p t="5187530" d="3859">It's representation as feminine. It's a brilliant book as well, and</p>
<p t="5192210" d="2359">highly worth Highly worth reading both those books</p>
<p t="5196320" d="2000">anyways</p>
<p t="5198750" d="3350">Young was a very strange person and a visionary and and</p>
<p t="5202679" d="2120">So he that's kept him outside of</p>
<p t="5205320" d="6260">The academic realm almost entirely I mean I was constantly warned as an undergraduate, and then a graduate student and then a professor</p>
<p t="5212460" d="4219">against ever talking about jung in any way whatsoever</p>
<p t="5217350" d="4099">When I went on the job market when I was at McGill when I had graduated from McGill</p>
<p t="5221610" d="4910">I'd done my scientific research in alcoholism, and I had a fairly Lengthy publication record</p>
<p t="5226520" d="3449">That was pure empirical research and really neural</p>
<p t="5230670" d="1890">physiological research</p>
<p t="5232560" d="3120">into the pharmacology of alcoholism and I</p>
<p t="5236350" d="2450">established a reasonably solid</p>
<p t="5239920" d="1280">dossier of publications</p>
<p t="5241200" d="5910">but at the same time I was writing this book that became maps of meaning and sorry split my time and graduate student school between</p>
<p t="5247110" d="2189">these two endeavors one very</p>
<p t="5250120" d="5540">Specifically neurological and pharmacological and really biologically based on the other very</p>
<p t="5256450" d="2750">Abstract religious symbolic psychoanalytic</p>
<p t="5259900" d="2779">The complete opposite, but I could see that the two things</p>
<p t="5263440" d="2000">overlapped really nicely and there was a number of</p>
<p t="5266080" d="2540">Scientists at the time that were also drawing the same</p>
<p t="5269440" d="1500">conclusions the same</p>
<p t="5270940" d="7790">Relationship between the biology and the psychoanalysis jacques panksepp who wrote a book called effective neuroscience which is a great classic is</p>
<p t="5279220" d="2149">one of those people who who saw the</p>
<p t="5282100" d="4850">relationship between the Neurobiology of emotion and motivation and the psychoanalytic insights</p>
<p t="5287890" d="2870">Never became a mainstream view but I think it's too complex</p>
<p t="5290760" d="6540">I think that bridging the gap between the biology and and the symbolic is too much for people generally speaking</p>
<p t="5297300" d="5490">You know it was certainly virtually too much for me because I got quite ill when I was a graduate student I think</p>
<p t="5302980" d="1280">for a variety of reasons</p>
<p t="5304260" d="4169">I also like with glug party three nights a week, and so that probably had something to do with it, but</p>
<p t="5310600" d="4670">But working on those two things simultaneously was also rather exhausting now</p>
<p t="5316000" d="1110">Jung</p>
<p t="5317110" d="2689">Was a tremendously insightful clinician</p>
<p t="5319800" d="2220">And he was a strange person introverted visionary</p>
<p t="5322480" d="7969">High in introversion very very very very very high in openness like off-the-charts and also God only knows what his IQ was I mean</p>
<p t="5330610" d="2060">Every time I read you it's like reading Nietzsche</p>
<p t="5332670" d="4649">It's terrifying because you know he's so damn smart that he can think up</p>
<p t="5337480" d="6500">Answers to questions that you don't even it's not like you don't understand the answers they never conceptualized the damn questions</p>
<p t="5343980" d="3540">It's really something to read someone like that right who says well</p>
<p t="5347520" d="6449">Here's the mystery and you think wow I never thought of that as a mystery and here's the solution. It's like okay. That's that's</p>
<p t="5355040" d="3020">That's something you know and he could read Greek and he could read</p>
<p t="5359510" d="6859">He read all the ancient... He read a very large variety of ancient languages and was very familiar with the entire corpus of</p>
<p t="5367730" d="3200">astrological thought and of alchemical thought and of</p>
<p t="5372050" d="7789">classic literature and biblical stories, and I mean educated in a way that no one is educated now and</p>
<p t="5380540" d="6979">So he's very daunting person to encounter and terrifying absolutely terrifying his book ion</p>
<p t="5387520" d="2000">which is the second volume of</p>
<p t="5390260" d="5060">it's the second volume of Volume 9 which is the archetypes of the collective unconscious that damn book is just</p>
<p t="5395540" d="3649">Absolutely terrifying because jung is one of these visionaries who can see?</p>
<p t="5399440" d="5930">Way underneath the social structures and look at patterns that are developing across for in Jung's case across</p>
<p t="5405560" d="7490">Thousands of years and lays them out and so that's a really that's really something to to encounter ion is a terrifying book</p>
<p t="5415130" d="1890">anyways one</p>
<p t="5417020" d="4580">Question might be well because I read Jung and I think how the hell did he know these things how could he figure these things?</p>
<p t="5421600" d="3390">Out I can't understand how he could possibly know these things</p>
<p t="5426020" d="2000">Well, here's a partial answer</p>
<p t="5429380" d="1680">Jung</p>
<p t="5431060" d="7250">Was a visionary and so what that means as far as I can tell and like we could do a little quick survey here</p>
<p t="5438310" d="2000">How many of you think you think in words?</p>
<p t="5441350" d="2000">Put up your hands. Do you think in words?</p>
<p t="5444980" d="3260">Ok so it looks like what about pictures. How many of you think in pictures?</p>
<p t="5449960" d="5030">Ok so that's interesting how many of you think that's about half and half by the way probably a few err on the word side</p>
<p t="5454990" d="2000">How many of you think in pictures and words?</p>
<p t="5458300" d="3739">Ok and so alright, so it was Roughly 1/3 in each category</p>
<p t="5462040" d="4530">But that's also something that I really haven't encountered any research on</p>
<p t="5467270" d="2450">from the neuropsychological perspective, it's like</p>
<p t="5470390" d="4759">Well, do you think in pictures or do you think in words and and is that actually a reliable distinction?</p>
<p t="5475150" d="2000">I think I think in words</p>
<p t="5477530" d="5119">Most of the time, but I can think in pictures like if I'm trying to build something I can think in pictures very</p>
<p t="5483200" d="3199">Almost instantaneously, but it isn't my natural mode of thinking</p>
<p t="5486500" d="4200">I'm hyper verbal and so my natural mode of thinking is to think everything through in words</p>
<p t="5491070" d="5929">But I know my wife isn't like that. She thinks and images and then has to translate them into words and so</p>
<p t="5497910" d="3260">Anyways, you was very literate, and he could really think in words</p>
<p t="5501170" d="5759">but he could really think in images also talking to my wife quite extensively like her the</p>
<p t="5507570" d="3409">intensity of her visualization vastly exceeds mine</p>
<p t="5511050" d="3799">So for example if I close my eyes and then try to imagine the crowd in front of me</p>
<p t="5514850" d="7320">it's pretty low resolution and vague and not brilliantly colored and vivid you know it's it's it's</p>
<p t="5522390" d="2750">Like I'm seeing through a glass darkly. Let's say</p>
<p t="5525140" d="3419">I can't bring images to mind with that with spectacular clarity</p>
<p t="5528560" d="3540">but my wife is very good at that and you seem to be absolutely a</p>
<p t="5533880" d="4639">Genius at that kind of thinking and he had a lot of visionaries in his family history as well</p>
<p t="5538520" d="3390">So I don't know to what degree there's a hereditary component of that</p>
<p t="5541910" d="5640">And I don't know to what degree that's actually like a neurological specialization. I presume it would be associated with</p>
<p t="5548940" d="2000">the trait Openness</p>
<p t="5551310" d="4220">Distinguishes itself differentiates itself into interesting ideas and interest in aesthetics</p>
<p t="5555530" d="6270">And my suspicion are is that the people who are more interested in aesthetics are the visionary types the ones that think in images.</p>
<p t="5561990" d="3109">Anyways Jung could really think in images and he could imagine</p>
<p t="5565890" d="5419">beings and I had a client once who was a lucid dreamer and</p>
<p t="5571950" d="4160">How many of you had lucid dream? So you know you're dreaming? Well you well you're okay many</p>
<p t="5576510" d="7250">That's that phenomena wasn't really even even identified as a phenomena until the end of the 19th century</p>
<p t="5583760" d="1540">There was a book written about it that</p>
<p t="5585300" d="5419">freud tried to get his hands on but couldn't because it was a very rare book and then there was a</p>
<p t="5591180" d="2839">researcher about 30 years ago who started to study lucid dreams</p>
<p t="5594030" d="4910">But anyways, I had a client who was a lucid dreamer and one of the things she could do was</p>
<p t="5599580" d="2600">Ask her dream characters what</p>
<p t="5602850" d="3439">Information they were trying to convey and they would tell her.</p>
<p t="5606870" d="7490">So that was very interesting; and one of the consequences of that was I don't have this story completely right in my memory</p>
<p t="5614360" d="1630">But it's close enough</p>
<p t="5615990" d="6029">She was afraid of a very large number of things and in her dream. I think it was a gypsy</p>
<p t="5622630" d="6649">Standing by a wagon told her that if she was going to be successful in university</p>
<p t="5629710" d="3319">that she would have to visit the slaughterhouse and</p>
<p t="5633730" d="4790">That was something that was way beyond her capacity of tolerate she was a vegetarian</p>
<p t="5638560" d="3379">she couldn't stand the sight of raw meat even and so and</p>
<p t="5642369" d="7340">She was very oppressed and depressed and anxious because of the slaughterhouse nature of existence and so her dream</p>
<p t="5649900" d="2000">focused on that and</p>
<p t="5652210" d="5479">One of the consequences of that because the slaughterhouse was out of the question as a clinical intervention</p>
<p t="5658300" d="1080">I</p>
<p t="5659380" d="2000">Took her to an embalming</p>
<p t="5662440" d="2899">Right because because I asked her I asked her what what?</p>
<p t="5666219" d="7490">What might be equivalent to that and so she suggested that and you know exposure therapy is a hallmark of Clinical psychology?</p>
<p t="5673710" d="5069">right one of the things you do with people as a clinician is you find out what they're afraid of and</p>
<p t="5679239" d="6470">You gradually and voluntarily expose them to that and that cures them and that's associated with the hero myth, right?</p>
<p t="5685710" d="2580">It's exactly the same thing. It's like. There's a dragon</p>
<p t="5688690" d="4489">It's stopping you because there's lots of dragons most of them aren't stopping you. You can ignore them</p>
<p t="5693179" d="3720">You don't have to just go you know slash away it randomly</p>
<p t="5697060" d="4189">You're not supposed to be fighting dragons that aren't in your way, but if they are in your way</p>
<p t="5701250" d="2879">You can't ignore them and then you decompose them into sub dragons</p>
<p t="5704130" d="4080">And you have people you know take them on and as they take them on</p>
<p t="5708550" d="3770">They dispense with the dragon and they gain the power of the drag. It's like a video game</p>
<p t="5713199" d="4640">Actually a video game is like that. That's why people like the video games. Well, that's right, right?</p>
<p t="5717840" d="5970">There's a reason that you absorb power when you overcome things when you play a video game. It's not like that's</p>
<p t="5724360" d="2989">Intrinsic to the video game structure, that's an archetypal idea</p>
<p t="5727960" d="2779">Anyways, we went and saw an embalmbng which was a very interesting</p>
<p t="5732489" d="2000">experience and</p>
<p t="5734860" d="1049">and</p>
<p t="5735909" d="6169">quite quite useful for her because she knew what she could tolerate after that and it was a hell of a lot more than she</p>
<p t="5742079" d="2790">Thought she could tolerate and so that's very useful to know</p>
<p t="5746619" d="1850">Back to Jung</p>
<p t="5748469" d="7729">He's a visionary thinker now my client. I said she could lucid dream, and she could ask her dream</p>
<p t="5757050" d="1290">characters</p>
<p t="5758340" d="4339">What they wanted and what they were trying to communicate to her so that was pretty interesting</p>
<p t="5762960" d="2389">That happens spontaneously had nothing to do with me</p>
<p t="5765530" d="3750">I mean, I'm interested in dreams and many of my clients are great dreamers</p>
<p t="5769280" d="5220">Especially the creative ones because I think it's a hallmark of creativity to have vivid dreams and to be able to remember them</p>
<p t="5774989" d="4189">But that was a faculty that was natural to her</p>
<p t="5780929" d="1891">Jung</p>
<p t="5782820" d="2299">Had this other client at One time at one point</p>
<p t="5785849" d="2600">And she had a variety of fears and she had this dream that</p>
<p t="5789150" d="2330">She told me and she was walking down a beach</p>
<p t="5792270" d="3289">And on the side of the beach up a dune a small dune</p>
<p t="5795869" d="4550">there was this old man with a snake a big python, and there's a crowd around him and</p>
<p t="5801780" d="2000">she was walking by the</p>
<p t="5803969" d="3859">Snake handler and the snake in the crowd and she didn't want to have anything to do with them</p>
<p t="5807829" d="2000">he was sort of showing people the snake and</p>
<p t="5810389" d="4130">She told me that dream, and I thought well. You know you probably need to go see that snake</p>
<p t="5815489" d="1650">and so I</p>
<p t="5817139" d="3620">Relaxed hers quasi hypnotic technique, and it's very straightforward</p>
<p t="5821940" d="2000">Hypnosis is generally nothing but</p>
<p t="5824250" d="5239">pronounced relaxation well you have to be susceptible to hypnosis to actually fall into a hypnotic trance as a</p>
<p t="5829590" d="2569">Consequence of being relaxed I just relaxed her</p>
<p t="5832159" d="4890">I had her breathe deeply and pay attention to different parts of her body and just relax her muscles</p>
<p t="5837329" d="5479">One by one essentially so that she could concentrate and then I told her we play with the dream a little bit</p>
<p t="5843570" d="6290">It's a Jungian technique said well, so call the dream image to mind which she could do quite well said okay</p>
<p t="5849860" d="3689">So let's let's explore it. It's like pretend. It's like pretend play</p>
<p t="5854099" d="6979">You know if you're a kid in your pretend playing you don't exactly direct the game right you you play the game?</p>
<p t="5861389" d="3709">So it's partly your direction obviously because you're the player</p>
<p t="5865099" d="1960">But the thing also happens spontaneously</p>
<p t="5867059" d="6229">Out of its own accord and you can think about that as a dialogue between the conscious mind in the unconscious mind in some sense</p>
<p t="5873289" d="5220">It's a developmental dialogue. It's not a fun game. If you just direct it. It's only a fun game if</p>
<p t="5879030" d="4750">you're inviting and something is well as a consequence the same thing that happens when you're</p>
<p t="5884420" d="4699">You're engaged in some kind of artistic or literary production if it's all top down</p>
<p t="5889489" d="3109">You know if you're forcing it then it's Propaganda</p>
<p t="5892599" d="5100">It's empty what you want to sort of put yourself in a receptive state of mind in an imaginative state of mind</p>
<p t="5897699" d="2160">And it's sort of half you in half</p>
<p t="5900980" d="1590">Nature itself</p>
<p t="5902570" d="6649">Manifesting itself in your creative imagination, and that was the sort of state that we were striving for, and she, I</p>
<p t="5910520" d="4549">Asked her when she was in relaxed. I said well, what do you think about the snake handler and she said well?</p>
<p t="5915070" d="4979">He's probably a Charlatan and he's just their turn to impress the crowd and to show off and she was afraid to go up there</p>
<p t="5920050" d="3270">Because she thought people would push her towards the snake and she'd have to touch it</p>
<p t="5923320" d="5399">And so there was a fear of the crowd issue going on there too, and I said well, just look go up there</p>
<p t="5929750" d="3949">About do it under these conditions. Is that you know if people get pushy</p>
<p t="5933699" d="3030">What are you going to tell them and so we figured out something said look?</p>
<p t="5937340" d="1740">Just tell them that</p>
<p t="5939080" d="1170">You know you want to</p>
<p t="5940250" d="5540">look at the snake at your own pace and that you don't need any encouragement or help and it would be good if you</p>
<p t="5945980" d="2779">Were just left alone so that enabled her to defend yourself</p>
<p t="5948820" d="3089">so she was afraid that the crowd would push her to do something that</p>
<p t="5952010" d="2870">She didn't want to do that was part of the theme of the dream</p>
<p t="5955040" d="770">So anyway</p>
<p t="5955810" d="429">she</p>
<p t="5956239" d="1920">Eventually climbed the dune in her imagination</p>
<p t="5958159" d="4370">And went into the crowd and the crowd turned out to be quite welcoming and not hostile and not pushy</p>
<p t="5962690" d="4339">Which isn't what you'd expect right because the you'd think the crowd would have,</p>
<p t="5967730" d="6409">Reacted in accordance with her fears since it was her fantasy, but that's the thing about fantasies. They have this autonomous quality</p>
<p t="5974389" d="5060">But the crowd was welcoming and not hostile and it turned out that the snake handler wasn't a Charlatan</p>
<p t="5979820" d="2839">He was just an old guy who had this snake and he was out there</p>
<p t="5982880" d="3709">just showing it to people because he thought it was a cool thing and and</p>
<p t="5986929" d="5540">And that maybe it was good for people to come and look at a snake and so she got close enough to the snake to</p>
<p t="5992469" d="1750">touch it and so</p>
<p t="5994219" d="5060">So I'm telling you that because I want you to understand a bit more about what jung was trying to do and so</p>
<p t="5999590" d="2000">He wrote these books</p>
<p t="6002739" d="5120">notebooks that haven't been published yet called the black books and the black books are the</p>
<p t="6008349" d="2420">documentation of his experiments with his imagination</p>
<p t="6011320" d="1350">and</p>
<p t="6012670" d="6170">What he would do is he dream like a child daydreams. He regained that faculty although</p>
<p t="6018840" d="2729">I think with Jung it was a faculty that had never really disappeared and</p>
<p t="6022900" d="5239">he had figures of imagination that came to him that he could speak with and</p>
<p t="6028420" d="7399">He spoke with these figures of imagination and documented that over a very long period of time, and that was originally that was</p>
<p t="6036340" d="2000">eventually</p>
<p t="6039550" d="4939">Distilled into a book called the red book which was published about three or four years ago</p>
<p t="6044490" d="3270">and it was a book that jung regarded as the</p>
<p t="6049660" d="3080">Central source from which all his inspiration</p>
<p t="6053710" d="1680">emerged</p>
<p t="6055390" d="2930">it was sort of the way it looks to me is that</p>
<p t="6059410" d="5450">we embody a lot of information in our action right and our action has</p>
<p t="6065500" d="5570">Developed as a consequence of imitating other people and not only the people the people around us</p>
<p t="6071070" d="5580">But of course the people around us imitated the people who came before them and those people imitated the people who came before them</p>
<p t="6076650" d="7589">And so on so far back that it's as far back as you can go and so you embody these patterns of behavior that are</p>
<p t="6084430" d="6709">Extremely informative that you don't understand that are a consequence of collective imitation across the centuries and so then those</p>
<p t="6091240" d="6109">patterns can become manifest as figures of the imagination and those figures of</p>
<p t="6097780" d="3500">imagination are the distillation of patterns of behavior and</p>
<p t="6102220" d="1320">so as</p>
<p t="6103540" d="7700">The distillation of patterns of behavior they have content and it's not you that content. It's you could even think about it as content</p>
<p t="6111240" d="1140">That's evolves although</p>
<p t="6112380" d="1720">It's culturally transmitted this</p>
<p t="6114100" d="6709">content that's evolved and so these figures of the imagination can reveal the structure of reality to you and</p>
<p t="6121330" d="4790">That's what happened with jung, and that's what he described in the red book, and that was what permeated his</p>
<p t="6126970" d="1680">psychology, A</p>
<p t="6128650" d="2000">Psychology that was based on the presupposition</p>
<p t="6131050" d="5719">That the fundamental archetypal structures of religious belief were not</p>
<p t="6137380" d="2479">pathological not deceitful not</p>
<p t="6140680" d="6740">Protective in some delusional sense against the fear of death, but quite the contrary the very stories that in</p>
<p t="6147930" d="2549">enabled us to move forward as</p>
<p t="6151210" d="3560">confident human beings in the face of Chaos itself</p>
<p t="6155950" d="3589">And it's conceivable. I think perhaps probable</p>
<p t="6160810" d="2000">That nothing more important</p>
<p t="6163420" d="3799">Conceptually happened in the 20th century than that</p>
<p t="6168190" d="2000">Because it was the first time</p>
<p t="6170440" d="1860">post enlightenment</p>
<p t="6172300" d="2000">that a rapprochement between</p>
<p t="6174640" d="2000">the intellect and the underlying</p>
<p t="6177430" d="2000">religious archetypal sub structure</p>
<p t="6179890" d="6500">Occurred you have in the capacious intellect of young the same thing happened to some degree with Piaget</p>
<p t="6187030" d="3919">the religious domain and the factual domain were brought back together and</p>
<p t="6192460" d="2600">the fact of Jung's enduring and</p>
<p t="6195790" d="4939">Increasing popularity and influence, I would say is a direct consequence of that now</p>
<p t="6203980" d="2900">some of his work was spun off into the new age and</p>
<p t="6207550" d="3830">And the new age is a very optimistic and naive movement</p>
<p t="6211510" d="5270">It's predicated on the idea that you can do nothing say, but follow your bliss and that will take you</p>
<p t="6217450" d="4520">Ever higher to enlightenment, and that's not the Jungian idea at all</p>
<p t="6223180" d="2000">the Jungian idea is that</p>
<p t="6226000" d="3320">What you most need will be found where you least want to look</p>
<p t="6230470" d="1940">So there's this story king arthur</p>
<p t="6232410" d="5669">There's this story of king arthur that they're all in a round table right king arthur and his knights. They're all equals. They're all</p>
<p t="6238630" d="3559">superordinate, but they're all equals and they go off to look for the holy Grail and</p>
<p t="6242740" d="5870">The holy Grail is the container of the redemptive substance whatever that is</p>
<p t="6249460" d="4190">It might be the cup that christ used at the last supper might be</p>
<p t="6254320" d="6109">Chalice that was used to capture his blood on the cross right when he was pierced by a sword the stories differ</p>
<p t="6260500" d="2450">But that's the holy grail and the holy grail is lost</p>
<p t="6262950" d="5370">that's the redemptive substance and the knights of king arthur go off to search for the holy Grail and</p>
<p t="6268420" d="1800">But they don't know where to look</p>
<p t="6270220" d="4040">So where do you look when you don't know where to look for something you need?</p>
<p t="6275260" d="1500">desperately</p>
<p t="6276760" d="1770">But have lost</p>
<p t="6278530" d="4219">well each of the knights goes into the forest at the point of the Darkest to him and</p>
<p t="6283870" d="2419">That's Jungian psychoanalysis in a nutshell</p>
<p t="6287140" d="7129">It's like that which you fear and avoid that's what you hold in contempt that which disgusts you and that you avoid</p>
<p t="6294880" d="2389">That's the Gateway to what you need to know</p>
<p t="6298330" d="2899">There's nothing new age about that. That's for sure</p>
<p t="6303010" d="7069">Now Jung when he started this endeavor, He started with this this is part of the notebooks from the black book he said</p>
<p t="6312100" d="2000">He wrote my soul</p>
<p t="6314140" d="5689">For my soul. Where are you? Do you hear me? I speak I call you are you there?</p>
<p t="6320680" d="2000">I've returned I'm</p>
<p t="6322780" d="6409">Here again, I've Shaken the dust of all the lands from my feet, and I've come to you. I am with you</p>
<p t="6329920" d="2629">After long years of long wandering I have come to you again</p>
<p t="6335890" d="2000">for the Jungians the</p>
<p t="6337930" d="3830">Hero's journey is a journey within and and I think that that's probably</p>
<p t="6342850" d="1170">the</p>
<p t="6344020" d="5150">Bias of introverts to believe that the Hero's journey isn't only an inward Journey</p>
<p t="6349170" d="6629">I think that it can be an outward journey too because I don't think it matters where you confront the unknown whether it's within or</p>
<p t="6356800" d="4879">Without what matters is whether or not you confront the unknown. That's what matters</p>
<p t="6367300" d="2179">But he found that what he had ignored</p>
<p t="6370810" d="4910">Was an undiscovered part of himself so that might be something that was equivalent to huxley's</p>
<p t="6376660" d="2500">Notion that there were tremendous</p>
<p t="6379440" d="5900">Tremendous Potential breath in the realm of human Conscious experience and Huxley was influenced to some degree by Jung</p>
<p t="6386160" d="6800">now Jung knew of Huxley's experiments and had commented on psychedelic use and he said something like</p>
<p t="6393580" d="2300">Beware of wisdom you did not earn and</p>
<p t="6397210" d="6800">Jung was very good at stating things very profoundly very simply and that's a very intelligent piece of advice Beware of</p>
<p t="6404560" d="2000">Wisdom you did not earn he wrote a paper</p>
<p t="6407170" d="6559">If you're interested in this sort of thing he wrote a paper be called the relations between the ego and the unconscious</p>
<p t="6413890" d="5749">Which is an absolute masterwork, but completely incomprehensible unless you know what it unless you know what it's about</p>
<p t="6419639" d="4800">And what it's about is the danger of what he called ego inflation</p>
<p t="6424440" d="3989">And so one of the things that can happen as a consequence of a revelatory experience is</p>
<p t="6429159" d="2000">that the</p>
<p t="6431170" d="5179">Division between the individual ego and and and what would you call it?</p>
<p t="6436989" d="2000">So hard to come up with a word that isn't</p>
<p t="6439659" d="2000">somehow naive or</p>
<p t="6441790" d="2000">or cliched</p>
<p t="6444610" d="6680">To erase the relationship the boundary between the specific consciousness of the ego and the more generalized</p>
<p t="6452139" d="1201">consciousness</p>
<p t="6453340" d="3140">And more generalized consciousness as such is</p>
<p t="6457119" d="7220">A dangerous thing to do because you can start to equate yourself your specific self with that more generalized</p>
<p t="6465010" d="6020">consciousness as such and Jung thought about that is it something akin to a psychotic inflation and</p>
<p t="6471820" d="7759">the paper relations between the ego and the unconscious is a document that tells you how to avoid that if you're</p>
<p t="6482650" d="2000">playing in this kind of realm and</p>
<p t="6485770" d="1590">one of the</p>
<p t="6487360" d="2299">Injunctions is to keep your feet on the ground</p>
<p t="6490840" d="5239">He thought that was what partly what happened to Nietzsche was that Nietzsche wasn't grounded enough in life</p>
<p t="6496079" d="6570">He wasn't grounded enough in Day-To-day rituals and routines and the mundane now you could debate whether or not</p>
<p t="6502650" d="4739">That's the case whether or not that's a reasonable argument, but that was still what Jung believed</p>
<p t="6508869" d="2000">Okay, so why am I telling you all this?</p>
<p t="6513219" d="4910">I'll finish with this from December 1913 onward jung carried on in the same procedure</p>
<p t="6518829" d="2420">Deliberately evoke a fantasy in a waking state</p>
<p t="6521250" d="6540">And then entering into it as a drama these fantasies may be understood as a type of dramatized thinking in pictorial form in</p>
<p t="6528460" d="5209">Retrospect he recalled that his scientific question was to see what took place when he switched off consciousness</p>
<p t="6534579" d="2000">the example of dreams indicated the</p>
<p t="6536650" d="1670">existence of background activity</p>
<p t="6538320" d="6899">And he wanted to give this a possibility of emerging just as one does when taking mescaline. These journals are jung's contemporary?</p>
<p t="6545590" d="7820">Contemporaneous clinical ledger to his most difficult experiment or what later describes as a voyage of discovery to the other pole of the world?</p>
<p t="6554140" d="2029">You'll believe that we were dreaming all the time</p>
<p t="6556960" d="5840">but that during waking life the pressure of external images was such that the</p>
<p t="6563830" d="6740">Unconscious fantasy imagery was or that the fantasy imagery was of insufficient magnitude to be conscious</p>
<p t="6570570" d="3629">But that we were always situated in a dream in relationship to the world</p>
<p t="6575020" d="2000">so</p>
<p t="6584140" d="2000">When we started talking about</p>
<p t="6587650" d="7819">The creation of the universe at the beginning of the genesis stories, I spent quite a long time setting the stage for the stories because</p>
<p t="6596650" d="4489">There's no point in having a conversation about the God who gives rise to being</p>
<p t="6601690" d="5690">Unless you have some sense of what that might conceivably mean to the modern mind, and I felt the same way about</p>
<p t="6608590" d="3259">the Abrahamic stories is I couldn't get a handle on them</p>
<p t="6612670" d="3110">Until I could understand and articulate more clearly</p>
<p t="6616480" d="1890">What it might mean?</p>
<p t="6618370" d="3020">how a modern person might understand a</p>
<p t="6623380" d="2989">direct experience of God in the first question would be</p>
<p t="6627130" d="3709">is such a thing possible and the answer to that seems to be a</p>
<p t="6631780" d="3949">Qualified yes, first of all it's a universal human experience. That's a very strange thing</p>
<p t="6636130" d="7459">It's not something that people have made up as freud might have it as a defense against death. It's not a tenable hypothesis</p>
<p t="6643590" d="6119">it's a realm of potential experience now that experience doesn't necessarily have to have the</p>
<p t="6650230" d="3439">Judeo-Christian content that we've been discussing quite the contrary there are</p>
<p t="6654460" d="5900">Manifestations of this these alternative forms of consciousness all over the world that take on their own peculiar forms although</p>
<p t="6660360" d="1260">They're patterned to some degree</p>
<p t="6661620" d="5549">that's like the hero myth for example of myth of the fight against the dragon seems to be unbelievably widespread and</p>
<p t="6667420" d="2000">So it's not as if it's random</p>
<p t="6673120" d="2060">Sorry, I should just see what time it is here</p>
<p t="6681750" d="4399">But there's not much point in having a discussion about what happens to abraham</p>
<p t="6686820" d="5959">Unless you can conceptualize it in terms that are amenable to modern skeptical consciousness</p>
<p t="6692880" d="2000">So we can establish the proposition that</p>
<p t="6695429" d="1911">Mystical experience is not only possible It's quite common</p>
<p t="6698160" d="7600">and It's inducible in a variety of ways and the manner in which it's inducible is reliable and there's no evidence as well that it's pathological</p>
<p t="6705989" d="5840">In fact there's a fair bit of evidence that the patterns of behavior that are associated with the mystical experience are</p>
<p t="6712080" d="2989">core elements of proper Human adaptation in the world</p>
<p t="6739239" d="6919">The abrahamic stories open up with a manifest God now I'm going to read you some things from Friedman who wrote the disappearance of God</p>
<p t="6748059" d="5000">He was trying to look at the underlying structure of the stories now. You know Friedman noted that</p>
<p t="6753909" d="2780">The books in the old testament were written by a lot of different people</p>
<p t="6757389" d="7580">At very different times and then they were sequenced by other people for reasons that we don't exactly understand</p>
<p t="6766270" d="2659">But there's still an underlying narrative</p>
<p t="6768929" d="7140">There's multiple underlying narrative unities despite the fact of that rather arbitrary sequencing, and that's a strange thing</p>
<p t="6776710" d="2000">You know I guess you could say</p>
<p t="6778809" d="4850">If you had a collection of ancient books and you were trying to put them together you'd try to put them together in some way</p>
<p t="6783659" d="1690">that made sense</p>
<p t="6785349" d="6260">right and it wouldn't make sense unless you stumbled across some kind of underlying narrative that allowed you to order them and</p>
<p t="6791920" d="5120">So it's not entirely surprising that that they're ordered in a manner that's comprehensible, but</p>
<p t="6797739" d="2810">Friedman's comments on the Underlying narrative structure</p>
<p t="6802030" d="1680">part of it was</p>
<p t="6803710" d="6080">well, we'll go through this the books of the old testament were composed by a great many authors according to both traditional religious views in</p>
<p t="6809790" d="5669">Modern Critical scholarship the phenomenon of the diminishing apparent presence of God across so many stories</p>
<p t="6815710" d="4069">Through so many books by so many authors spread over so many centuries is</p>
<p t="6820270" d="3589">Consistent enough to be striking impressive and ultimately mysterious</p>
<p t="6825760" d="2750">But the hiding of the divine face is only half the story</p>
<p t="6828550" d="4729">There's another development also extending across the course of the entire narrative of the Hebrew Bible</p>
<p t="6833679" d="3919">which we must see before we can appreciate the full force of this phenomena and</p>
<p t="6838000" d="4399">before we can pose a solution to the mystery of this of how this happened gradually from</p>
<p t="6842530" d="5660">Genesis to Ezra and Esther there is a transition from Divine to human responsibility for life on Earth</p>
<p t="6849639" d="3770">the story begins in Genesis with God in complete control of the creation</p>
<p t="6853409" d="6180">But by the end humans have arrived at a stage at which in all apparent ways they have responsibility for the fate of the world</p>
<p t="6860650" d="2000">the first two human beings</p>
<p t="6864099" d="7160">Adam and Eve. Take little responsibility themselves they do not design or build anything when they're embarrassed over there nudity</p>
<p t="6871260" d="5430">They do not make clothes they cover themselves with leaves. It's God who makes their first clothing for them</p>
<p t="6878260" d="1170">Noah</p>
<p t="6879430" d="4609">By no means a fully developed personality Noah is not an everyman either broadly speaking</p>
<p t="6884080" d="3229">He reflects a step Beyond Adam and eve in human character and responsibility</p>
<p t="6889420" d="1200">Abraham</p>
<p t="6890620" d="6410">Beyond the counts of Divine commands that abraham does carry out the narrative also includes a variety of stories in Which abraham</p>
<p t="6897310" d="3620">Acts on his own initiative he divides land with his nephew lot</p>
<p t="6900930" d="4709">He battles kings he takes concubines he argues with his wife Sarah on two occasions</p>
<p t="6905640" d="4830">he tells kings that Sarah is his sister out of fear that they will kill him to get his wife and</p>
<p t="6910630" d="4429">He arranges in son's marriage in the place of the single story of Noah's drunkenness</p>
<p t="6915060" d="2580">There are in the case of Abraham the stories of man's life</p>
<p t="6918520" d="4100">The Abraham section thus develops the personality and character of a man a man</p>
<p t="6922780" d="6560">To a new degree in biblical narrative while picturing in him a new degree of responsibility it is not just that Abraham is kind lured</p>
<p t="6929410" d="4760">Kinder gentler More Intrepid more ethical or a better debater than his ancestor, Noah?</p>
<p t="6934540" d="6920">Rather both the Noah and the Abraham stories are pieces of a development of an increasingly stronger stance of humans relative to the deity</p>
<p t="6941710" d="4669">Before the story is over humans will become a great deal stronger and bolder than abraham</p>
<p t="6955170" d="2000">I don't know what that means you know</p>
<p t="6959050" d="2000">see</p>
<p t="6961060" d="2750">It isn't it is certainly the case that</p>
<p t="6964360" d="4100">the individual exists in the Modern world the differentiated</p>
<p t="6968830" d="5929">Self-Aware self conscious individual and it's certainly the case that that wasn't the case at some point in the past and</p>
<p t="6974920" d="2000">So it's the case that there's been a development</p>
<p t="6977020" d="2330">I don't know if you could call it a progression</p>
<p t="6979350" d="6060">But a development of the autonomous individual over some span of historical time now</p>
<p t="6985410" d="4370">We don't know how long that's been but my suspicions are it hasn't been that long</p>
<p t="6990420" d="2000">I mean,</p>
<p t="6993940" d="2000">I read once</p>
<p t="6996429" d="7790">about a neolithic ceremony that involved the particular placement of a bear skull in a cave, and then I read that and</p>
<p t="7005100" d="4969">They had found these placements in caves that were at least 25,000 years old</p>
<p t="7010070" d="500">And then I read that they found caves in Japan among the Ainu</p>
<p t="7010570" d="3520">who were</p>
<p t="7014219" d="4910">the indigenous inhabitants of Japanese territory and Rather Archaic people who</p>
<p t="7019230" d="4819">Had the same ceremony with the bear and that put the skull in the same orientation</p>
<p t="7024330" d="5569">And place in caves and that that tradition remained unbroken for about 25,000 years</p>
<p t="7029900" d="1290">And you think:</p>
<p t="7031190" d="3870">Well is it possible for an oral or ritual tradition to remain unbroken for?</p>
<p t="7035310" d="5299">Spans of tens of thousands of years and the answer to that is not only is it possible. It's actually the norm</p>
<p t="7041370" d="1530">because like</p>
<p t="7042900" d="4879">One Chimpanzee is like the next chimpanzee right in the in the progression in the biological</p>
<p t="7048060" d="5659">Progression if you took a chimpanzee troop now, and he went back 25,000 years and you looked at a chimpanzee troop</p>
<p t="7053719" d="2160">It'd be the same thing. There's no historical progression</p>
<p t="7056550" d="2390">That's how you can tell the chimps really don't have culture</p>
<p t="7059400" d="6379">Because it's bigger it could even accrete one one thousandth of a percent of culture transmissible culture per generation</p>
<p t="7066270" d="2719">It wouldn't take more than about a million years before</p>
<p t="7068989" d="1000">They'd have a whole civilization</p>
<p t="7069989" d="7850">And they don't they're the same as they were and so the continuity the stability and unchanging nature of the species</p>
<p t="7079350" d="3829">Essentially speaking is the rule that the variant is us</p>
<p t="7083880" d="2510">It's like what the hell happened after the last ice age</p>
<p t="7087030" d="2000">fifteen thousand years ago</p>
<p t="7089030" d="2000">We went from Tribal</p>
<p t="7091320" d="5330">Uniform stable to whatever the hell. We are now it's this transition from</p>
<p t="7098370" d="5030">Generic to specific, it's something like that, and I can't help but think that that's reflective in this text</p>
<p t="7103400" d="3839">and it has something to do with this transition of consciousness from</p>
<p t="7108540" d="6290">From what from possession by the Generic divine to dominance by the specific individual?</p>
<p t="7114840" d="3109">It's something like that. Is that a neurological transformation?</p>
<p t="7117950" d="5879">is that what this is a record of being that we don't know one of the things young said about God because</p>
<p t="7124290" d="5030">Humans relationship with God as an object of belief is very complex</p>
<p t="7131400" d="1640">He in his technical writing</p>
<p t="7133040" d="3960">He always talks about the image of God he never talks about God he talks about the image of God</p>
<p t="7137280" d="7669">He said that the image of God dwells within that's not the same thing as God dwelling within right we could mean all of these</p>
<p t="7145860" d="5959">Capacities that we have for transcended consciousness could be a byproduct of biological evolution they could have no reflection</p>
<p t="7151820" d="4770">They could have no relationship whatsoever to an actual transcendent reality</p>
<p t="7156660" d="5419">There's no way of telling the transcendent reality seems to manifest itself as an element of experience</p>
<p t="7162080" d="2790">But that doesn't mean that it has in reality outside of the subjective</p>
<p t="7165270" d="3949">even if it's even if it exists as it is it clearly does but</p>
<p t="7181080" d="6830">Friedman suggests that what's happening in the biblical narrative is the sequential emergence of the individual as a redemptive?</p>
<p t="7188670" d="1500">Force and</p>
<p t="7190170" d="2239">that the old testament documents that</p>
<p t="7193260" d="3260">implicitly unconsciously as a consequence of</p>
<p t="7197430" d="3320">Descriptive fantasy and that that's what's going on in the book and that</p>
<p t="7202440" d="2810">so the cosmos is under the control of</p>
<p t="7206670" d="5179">Generic Deity to begin with something like that and then that control shifts to</p>
<p t="7213480" d="2000">localized identifiable</p>
<p t="7215880" d="2689">increasingly personal and detailed individuals</p>
<p t="7219630" d="4389">you see that in Noah, and then you see the neighbor ham and then you Moses and</p>
<p t="7224630" d="7100">Then there's this working out of what it would mean to be a fully developed individual, and that's what these stories. They're...</p>
<p t="7232400" d="3260">They're like prototype, they're attempts to...</p>
<p t="7236060" d="6890">To bring about the proper mode of being right and so Abraham is a is a manifestation about because he enters into a covenant with</p>
<p t="7242950" d="5069">God he's selected by God or enters into a partnership with God. It's not exactly obvious. God</p>
<p t="7249110" d="3530">provides him with forward motion and intuition and</p>
<p t="7253640" d="6799">Leads them towards a successful mode of being and it's complex successful mode of being cuz Abraham is a very complex life</p>
<p t="7260440" d="2610">There's plenty of ups and downs right it's it's not</p>
<p t="7263780" d="2000">unbroken</p>
<p t="7266000" d="1560">purity of being</p>
<p t="7267560" d="6740">Towards a divine and abraham lies and cheats and deceives and does all sorts of things that that a real person would do and</p>
<p t="7274670" d="5630">And moses for example kills someone and so these people that the biblical people are very</p>
<p t="7280820" d="5659">Genuine individuals, but they're given with all their faults right with all their sins with all their deceit</p>
<p t="7286480" d="5250">They're still put forth as potential modes of proper models of potential</p>
<p t="7292130" d="3020">proper being in the world and the entire corpus of the</p>
<p t="7295850" d="5060">Bible seems to be nothing but an attempt to keep throwing up variants of the</p>
<p t="7301250" d="5959">Personality trying to experiment to find out what personality works in the world</p>
<p t="7308330" d="5510">of course from a Christian perspective that culminates in the figure of christ as the redemptive word and that's</p>
<p t="7314120" d="7879">associated as we've already talked about with the force that brought order out of Chaos at the beginning of time and</p>
<p t="7322970" d="2000">so</p>
<p t="7325640" d="2000">well, that's my attempt to</p>
<p t="7328220" d="4790">provide proper context for the understanding of the abrahamic stories</p>
<p t="7333010" d="5040">And so hopefully with that context we can move forward</p>
<p t="7338750" d="1500">being able to</p>
<p t="7340250" d="6169">swallow the camel so to speak of the initial presence of God in the stories and</p>
<p t="7347210" d="3260">So we'll return to all of that next week</p>
<p t="7368530" d="2899">Let's wait one second. Okay till people</p>
<p t="7372250" d="1310">Have an opportunity to leave</p>
<p t="7373560" d="3540">I would very much like to ask the people who are asking the questions</p>
<p t="7377320" d="5300">To take a few seconds before they ask the question and make sure that the mic is positioned properly</p>
<p t="7382989" d="6290">So that everyone can hear you because people keep writing and complaining that while they're very happy with the questions</p>
<p t="7389280" d="5250">And I would say the questions have been a very high caliber so far, but they're not very happy that they can't hear them</p>
<p t="7394570" d="5359">So I know that you know you're obviously nervous and in a hurry when you want to ask you a question</p>
<p t="7399929" d="1931">but take a second or two to</p>
<p t="7401860" d="3560">Set the mic up properly and make sure that everyone can hear you and so</p>
<p t="7406440" d="1040">Have a way at it.</p>
<p t="7407660" d="860">";Hello Dr. Peterson";</p>
<p t="7408700" d="1400">Hey, there we go</p>
<p t="7410100" d="6540">";Tonight, I'd like to ask you about two different psychological disorders the first being Borderline personality disorder</p>
<p t="7417060" d="2000">so two lectures ago</p>
<p t="7419710" d="3770">Somebody asks you about it, and you gave a very sparse answer</p>
<p t="7423480" d="4319">I can't remember exactly what you said, but it seemed like it was uh</p>
<p t="7428800" d="6050">It would there was too much complexity to just answer it right there and then and then somebody else also acts</p>
<p t="7434949" d="2000">Asked you about the same disorder in</p>
<p t="7437409" d="7580">your patreon livestream recently and when they when they asked you that you kind of you kind of Stopped for a moment and</p>
<p t="7445510" d="2899">Something I don't know something kind of flicked on in your head</p>
<p t="7448510" d="3649">It seemed like and you and you thought for a couple seconds</p>
<p t="7452159" d="2000">And then you said you know what I don't think</p>
<p t="7454239" d="7130">That I can answer that right now because just - it's just too bloody complex, and I was wondering just like</p>
<p t="7462489" d="7400">Many young men have gravitated towards your lectures. Do you think that there's something about this particular disorder that</p>
<p t="7471670" d="5419">There's something about people with this particular disorder that might gravitate to your insights and your lectures";</p>
<p t="7477730" d="7189">Okay, okay, so now I would say probably no to the second one, but I could comment more about Borderline personality disorder</p>
<p t="7484920" d="3089">I think I have enough mental energy to do that tonight, so</p>
<p t="7489310" d="1590">technically speaking</p>
<p t="7490900" d="4520">It's often considered the female variant of antisocial personality disorder</p>
<p t="7496510" d="2330">So it's it's it's it's classified</p>
<p t="7498880" d="6299">or it's classified in the domain of externalizing disorders acting out disorders and</p>
<p t="7505790" d="2000">I think what happens,</p>
<p t="7508099" d="4610">We don't understand Borderline personality disorder very well, and it's characterized by</p>
<p t="7513800" d="2000">Tremendous impulsivity</p>
<p t="7518810" d="2000">Radical confusion of identity</p>
<p t="7521540" d="3379">and then this pattern of idealization of</p>
<p t="7525739" d="2000">people with whom the</p>
<p t="7528679" d="2000">person afflicted with the disorder is</p>
<p t="7531679" d="4520">Associating with radical idealization of those people and then radical devaluation of them</p>
<p t="7536199" d="3630">and then there's another theme that sort of weaves along with it, which is</p>
<p t="7540380" d="2000">the proclivity of</p>
<p t="7542810" d="4639">people with Borderline personality disorder to presume that they will be abandoned and</p>
<p t="7548060" d="4219">then to act in a manner that makes such abandonment virtually certain and</p>
<p t="7553429" d="2000">So it's a very complicated</p>
<p t="7556400" d="2000">disorder, but that I</p>
<p t="7558800" d="2000">Think gets at the Crux of it</p>
<p t="7561590" d="5720">One of the things that's interesting about people with Borderline personality disorder in my experience. Is that they're often</p>
<p t="7568190" d="2000">quite intelligent and</p>
<p t="7571070" d="2750">You you see in the person with Borderline personality</p>
<p t="7574460" d="4429">Disorder something like the waste or the squandering of tremendous potential</p>
<p t="7580040" d="2000">they seem capable of</p>
<p t="7582590" d="2359">thinking through the Nature of their problems and</p>
<p t="7585530" d="5149">analyzing it and discussing it but not capable whatsoever of implementing any solutions and</p>
<p t="7601530" d="3560">Technically, there's no relationship between IQ and conscientiousness</p>
<p t="7606270" d="1950">It's very weird</p>
<p t="7608220" d="3379">because if you read the neuropsychological literature and you</p>
<p t="7612510" d="4729">Read about the functions of the prefrontal Cortex. They're usually conceptualized in intellectual terms and</p>
<p t="7617940" d="3620">they're associated with planning and strategizing and so forth and</p>
<p t="7624690" d="4129">That's what conscientiousness is is planning and strategizing and implementation?</p>
<p t="7628820" d="7440">But the correlation between IQ and conscientiousness is zero and so as the correlation between working memory and conscientiousness</p>
<p t="7636690" d="1560">zero and Zero</p>
<p t="7638250" d="6649">Is a very low correlation right? I mean really it's hard to find things in psychology that are correlated at zero</p>
<p t="7645900" d="3050">Things tend to be correlated to some degree. They tend to be interrelated</p>
<p t="7650520" d="7549">the Borderline seems to be able to strategize and to abstract but not to be able to implement and</p>
<p t="7659070" d="5060">And so this the intellect per se seems to be functional</p>
<p t="7664130" d="3030">But it's not embodied in action</p>
<p t="7668220" d="2000">It's very so it can be</p>
<p t="7670440" d="3770">frustrating to be associated with someone who has borderline personality disorder because</p>
<p t="7674490" d="5989">They can tell you what the problem is and even tell you what the solution might be but there's no implementation</p>
<p t="7683100" d="2689">So maybe something went wrong developmentally</p>
<p t="7685800" d="6590">We don't know exactly how these sorts of things come about the other thing that seems to be characteristic of Borderline people with Borderline personality</p>
<p t="7692820" d="4820">disorder is that they they remind me very much of people who are 2 years old and</p>
<p t="7698190" d="2000">in some Manner like</p>
<p t="7700680" d="1440">people with Borderline personality</p>
<p t="7702120" d="5509">Disorder can have temper tantrums in fact they often do and we know now and then you see a temper tantrum</p>
<p t="7707629" d="5631">And they're usually thrown by two-year-olds right most people go out of temper tantrums by the time they're about three</p>
<p t="7713360" d="6220">They're very rare at four it. Which is a good thing because if they're still there at four that is not a good diagnostic predictor</p>
<p t="7720200" d="4720">that's a actually good diagnostic predictor, but it's not the kind that you want and</p>
<p t="7725700" d="6559">You know it's funny the way that we respond to two-year-old temper tantrums because the two-Year-old will throw themselves on the ground</p>
<p t="7732710" d="4860">beat their hands and their legs on the floor and scream and yell and turn red or even blue</p>
<p t="7737570" d="4709">I saw a child once who was capable of holding his breath during a temper tantrum until he turned blue</p>
<p t="7742560" d="5959">Which was really an impressive feat you should try that right? It's really hard is you really have to work at it and</p>
<p t="7749430" d="5660">You see that in adult borderlines. They'll have temper tantrums, and the funny thing is when a two-year-old does it it's like</p>
<p t="7755090" d="1930">It's you know, it's little</p>
<p t="7757020" d="1020">off-putting</p>
<p t="7758040" d="2240">but when an adult does it it's</p>
<p t="7760770" d="6680">Completely bloody terrifying and it happens very frequently with borderlines, and so I would also say to some degree</p>
<p t="7767970" d="4910">they didn't get properly socialized between that critical period Of development between two and four and you</p>
<p t="7773190" d="3050">See the same thing with adult males who grow up to the anti-social</p>
<p t="7776610" d="6439">Because a large proportion of adult males who grow up to be antisocial are aggressive as children as two-year-Olds</p>
<p t="7783660" d="2540">So there's a small proportion of two-Year-olds who are quite aggressive</p>
<p t="7786200" d="5819">They'll kick and hit and bite and steal if you put them with other two-year-olds it's about five percent of the of the Male's</p>
<p t="7792270" d="4340">Smaller fraction of the females, but most of them are socialized by the time, they're four</p>
<p t="7796740" d="6140">but there's a small percentage who aren't and they tend to stay antisocial and they tend to turn into long term offenders and</p>
<p t="7803160" d="6350">then attend the devel the critical period for socialization development seems to be between two and four and it seems to be mediated by</p>
<p t="7810180" d="5060">pretend play and Rough-and-Tumble play and those sorts of mechanisms, and if it isn't instantiated by the age of four</p>
<p t="7815970" d="5180">It doesn't happen, and it doesn't look like it's addressable now there are</p>
<p t="7822480" d="7130">dialectic behavioural therapies that have been developed for people with borderline personality disorder, and they're purported to be successful, but</p>
<p t="7831510" d="2870">";Okay, thank you. If I may so the second</p>
<p t="7835140" d="2600">Psychological disorder I want to ask you about is psychopathy</p>
<p t="7838260" d="2000">So you've mentioned that</p>
<p t="7840450" d="6950">Psychopaths tend to switch from dominance Hierarchy to dominance Hierarchy because people get tired of their shenanigans. They have to move on to fresh people</p>
<p t="7848400" d="1230">and</p>
<p t="7849630" d="6020">Psychopaths also tend to be very low in conscientiousness, and you said that when you see some of these protesters</p>
<p t="7856200" d="1830">at your speeches</p>
<p t="7858030" d="2000">some of the men in particular,</p>
<p t="7860220" d="1590">your</p>
<p t="7861810" d="7339">Clinical intuition tells you that there's something seriously pathological about them and I was wondering if you would suspect</p>
<p t="7869489" d="2000">That some of these men might be</p>
<p t="7871619" d="4970">Psychopathic as..."; well some of them likely are but I don't know if a higher proportion of the ones who show up at</p>
<p t="7876690" d="1699">Protests and sort of creep me out</p>
<p t="7878389" d="5160">Or I don't know if there's a higher proportion of people like that at the protests or not</p>
<p t="7883550" d="689">I mean</p>
<p t="7884239" d="7439">I suspect in general that regardless of the protest the proportion of people who have personality disorders among</p>
<p t="7891960" d="4069">Protesters is higher than the proportion of people who have personality disorders in the general</p>
<p t="7896159" d="6080">Population because you just expect that you just expect that kind of acting out behavior. I'm not believe me</p>
<p t="7902239" d="3899">I'm not saying that all protest is associated with personality disorder. I'm not saying that at all</p>
<p t="7906210" d="1860">There's plenty of reason for protest</p>
<p t="7908070" d="2299">But some of the reason for protests are</p>
<p t="7910829" d="5330">Credible reasons and some of them aren't credible reasons that -- ";I was just thinking that like the social justice</p>
<p t="7916320" d="3560">Hierarchy so to speak would be one of the last that these</p>
<p t="7920429" d="3290">Confusing--";, that's that's that's a different issue. You know there are</p>
<p t="7924869" d="4280">There are analysis of the dangers of agreeableness, so agreeable</p>
<p t="7929150" d="2969">This is a personality trait that underlies the radical</p>
<p t="7932550" d="4910">Egalitarian ethos because agreeable people want everything to be shared equally and it's a good</p>
<p t="7937460" d="6750">I think it's a good ethos for a small group for a family because family is kind of a communist system in some sense</p>
<p t="7944210" d="3509">Right it's like you want the food to be divided up equally among the children</p>
<p t="7948179" d="2810">clearly and you want all the children sort of regardless of their</p>
<p t="7951329" d="4460">Inherent abilities to have the same opportunities and perhaps even the same outcomes</p>
<p t="7955860" d="4009">So I think agreeableness which is associated at least in part with maternal</p>
<p t="7960389" d="4910">Maternal the Maternal Instinct let's say maternal patterns of Behavior. I think it's</p>
<p t="7966059" d="2000">It's a good</p>
<p t="7968250" d="1380">first Pass</p>
<p t="7969630" d="6229">Motivational approximation to a localized familial ethic I think it's a catastrophe at larger scales</p>
<p t="7975860" d="4709">I don't think it scales at all. I actually think that's why we evolved conscientiousness</p>

<p t="8058880" d="5780">";Hi, Dr. Peterson. I had one quick comment and a question so my comment was about your idea of but</p>
<p t="8065269" d="6020">Subpersonalities as one-eyed monsters now. There's the idea of multiple personality or split personality disorder</p>
<p t="8071289" d="2880">It's controversial as to whether or not it exists</p>
<p t="8074170" d="6389">But there's some research recent research that suggests that you may actually have multiple personalities</p>
<p t="8081019" d="4729">That use different parts of the brain so they have differential access to the hippocampus. They have their own memories</p>
<p t="8086840" d="1529">They can</p>
<p t="8088369" d="6410">they use the brain differently, but that seems to be an exaggeration of sub personalities</p>
<p t="8095179" d="2000">Which is quite interesting.</p>
<p t="8097429" d="2000">The question I had was about</p>
<p t="8099800" d="2120">So you talked about Jung and how</p>
<p t="8103699" d="4069">You should confront that which you don't want to confront the most</p>
<p t="8107769" d="6510">so you're most afraid or disgusted by that you've the most resistance to arm, so but we were talking about psychedelics and</p>
<p t="8114590" d="2000">in the experience of hell, so</p>
<p t="8117079" d="3979">at least some of the people I've talked to they describe negative trips as</p>
<p t="8121789" d="2030">an experience of a</p>
<p t="8125360" d="2299">constant fear prolonged fear and</p>
<p t="8128389" d="1710">some of the most</p>
<p t="8130099" d="5720">Dramatic and personalized fear that they've ever experienced; so shouldn't negative on</p>
<p t="8136489" d="2000">psychedelic trips</p>
<p t="8138619" d="5060">Elicit the kind of concentration that Jung thought you should engage them?"; Could be.</p>
<p t="8144739" d="2359">Could could well be you know it</p>
<p t="8149090" d="2000">It's conceivable that...</p>
<p t="8155630" d="2000">I read this strange book once that</p>
<p t="8158119" d="5600">made the claim that what was in the ark of the covenant was a mixture that was made from</p>
<p t="8164539" d="2000">Amanita Muscaria mushrooms</p>
<p t="8167400" d="2060">And that's not as far-fetched as you might think</p>
<p t="8170000" d="4460">Because there's a mycologist an amateur mycologist named Gordon Wasson</p>
<p t="8175120" d="1400">who</p>
<p t="8176539" d="4370">Established, credibly, the notion that it was Amanita Muscaria</p>
<p t="8181519" d="4040">potions that was the soma of the Rig veda and</p>
<p t="8186439" d="2720">so it's a strange idea but</p>
<p t="8190550" d="4549">it's not an idea that's completely outside of the realm of possibility and</p>
<p t="8197630" d="1529">the Amanita</p>
<p t="8199159" d="7550">Muscaria is the fly agaric in the red mushroom with white dots, and it's used in shamanic rituals in Cross Asia</p>
<p t="8207260" d="1169">and</p>
<p t="8208429" d="4309">It's apparently not toxic in its dried form although that is not a recommendation</p>

<p t="8221929" d="3080">One of the things that the priests had to do</p>
<p t="8227029" d="5150">before they commune with what was ever in the ark of the covenant was purify themselves and</p>
<p t="8233239" d="2360">So one possibility is that?</p>
<p t="8236269" d="1771">the bad</p>

<p t="8273040" d="2000">and so</p>
<p t="8275179" d="2000">But we don't know enough to know</p>

<p t="8292790" d="3469">";Citizen Peterson, you son of a bitch</p>
<p t="8297920" d="3830">How are you?"; I'm not too bad you got a question?</p>
<p t="8304580" d="4639">";That's the question. No I've got a real question. I got a great question you're going to like this one, okay?</p>
<p t="8309219" d="5610">It's about inspiration because you talk about inspiration quite a bit in this lecture series and also I wanted to point out</p>
<p t="8314960" d="2000">you have a I guess a</p>
<p t="8317300" d="6220">45-minute Armchair discussion, which you have a video of one paragraph of Nietzsche's Beyond good and evil</p>
<p t="8323520" d="7000">You posted and it seems like you're awestruck at the structure and the choices and I guess</p>
<p t="8331220" d="3860">the ideas contained in various layers of this paragraph</p>
<p t="8335080" d="5540">And you're inspired and that inspires you to I guess do your work that you do..?</p>
<p t="8341240" d="2000">I encountered, I guess a similar</p>
<p t="8344360" d="6000">Phenomenon here with one sentence written by the great Joseph Cardinal ratzinger and</p>
<p t="8350960" d="7399">I mean this one sentence answers the question why do people search for God and if you could read it out and then</p>
<p t="8358660" d="2000">Deconstruct it. It's on sentence</p>
<p t="8360700" d="2320">I've copied the original pages</p>
<p t="8365260" d="6140">It's at the end of page 105 if you want to read it from the book or I just--"; that's 'the question that</p>
<p t="8372280" d="2360">human existence not only poses</p>
<p t="8374660" d="7879">but itself is the in conclusiveness inherent in it the bounds it comes up against and that yet yearn for the</p>
<p t="8382760" d="4940">Unbounded more or less in the sense of Nietzsche's assertion that all pleasures yearns for eternity</p>
<p t="8387700" d="2040">It experiences itself as a moment</p>
<p t="8390021" d="7339">This simultaneity of being limited and of yearning for the unbounded and open has always prevented man from resting in himself</p>

<p t="8408320" d="2000">Well, it's a hell of a sentence</p>
<p t="8410840" d="5700">";Like when I read that sentence. I decided I wanted to write like Joseph Cardinal ratzinger</p>
<p t="8416600" d="3260">I had a very similar experience when I watched the Joe Rogan podcast</p>

<p t="8425140" d="3920">That's what I wanted to do"; so I had this...</p>
<p t="8429060" d="4540">I had this discussion with a patreon supporter this week a young guy</p>
<p t="8434360" d="2000">from Australia and</p>
<p t="8436460" d="6709">He said something very interesting that's related to this and it's a bit. It's something that's very profound. I said I think</p>
<p t="8445610" d="7429">There's this idea in Christianity that we've discussed briefly that the judge and the redeemer are the same figure now</p>
<p t="8453040" d="2669">You know in the book of revelation you may know this and you may not</p>
<p t="8456351" d="2000">Christ comes back as a</p>
<p t="8459230" d="5569">Judge he has a sword coming out.. it's a revelatory vision. Not that that book it's a very strange</p>
<p t="8465891" d="5599">It's the last thing you'd expect conservative Christians to believe and believe me and such a visionary</p>
<p t="8472130" d="1520">hallucination the book of revelation</p>
<p t="8473650" d="4529">but christ comes back with a sword coming out of his mouth and he comes back as a judge and he</p>
<p t="8479090" d="4100">Divides the damned from the redeemed and most are damned and some are redeemed</p>
<p t="8483190" d="6059">It's very very harsh Jung believed that the figure of christ in the gospels was too agreeable</p>
<p t="8489680" d="4790">To merciful to tilted towards mercy and that that called out for a counter</p>
<p t="8494630" d="4459">position and that the counter position of judgment very interesting hypothesis</p>
<p t="8499399" d="5629">But then but then there's this this melding of the two ideas that the judge and the redeemer are the same thing</p>
<p t="8506000" d="1229">Okay</p>
<p t="8507229" d="1291">now</p>
<p t="8508520" d="3200">This young man told me that his life lacked</p>
<p t="8512359" d="7459">Purpose and direction and meaning and that he was nihilistic until he started he read ";zen in the art of motorcycle maintenance";</p>
<p t="8520729" d="1761">Which is a book I actually like quite a bit</p>
<p t="8522490" d="5159">I've read it three times at different decades of my life and one of the things that's very interesting about that book is that it's</p>
<p t="8527649" d="4110">an examination of the idea of quality of the idea that there are</p>
<p t="8532160" d="7429">Qualitative distinctions between things and that we have an instinct to make qualitative distinctions and so a qualitative distinction is</p>
<p t="8540300" d="3580">Simply this is better than that which is a judgment</p>
<p t="8544480" d="2000">Okay, now what ratzinger is</p>
<p t="8547960" d="2000">hypothesizing is that</p>
<p t="8550160" d="4759">The person in enough you know how you the idea of the modern idea is you're supposed to accept yourself</p>
<p t="8555040" d="7139">I think that's an insane idea by the way really I think I can't think of a more nihilistic idea than that you're already ok</p>
<p t="8562430" d="860">It's like no</p>
<p t="8563290" d="2690">You're not and the reason you're not is could you could be way more?</p>
<p t="8566060" d="4500">Than you are so what do you want to be you want to be ok as you are or do you want to strive</p>
<p t="8570860" d="2000">towards what's better? and</p>
<p t="8573229" d="1821">This young man this australian</p>
<p t="8575050" d="3690">he said that the reason that 'zen and the art of motorcycle maintenance' had such a</p>
<p t="8579109" d="5150">Impact on him was because he wasn't happy with his current mode of being right he didn't</p>
<p t="8584779" d="2720">Consider the Manner in which he conducted himself</p>
<p t="8588109" d="2000">sufficient and the fact that</p>
<p t="8591140" d="5960">The author of Zen and, it was Persik laid out the notion that you could make qualitative distinctions,</p>
<p t="8597100" d="5620">And there really was a difference between good things and bad things or great things and evil things, it gives you direction</p>
<p t="8603580" d="4120">it gives you gives you the possibility of moving upward and</p>
<p t="8608540" d="2629">Ratzinger is pointing out at least to some degree that</p>
<p t="8611510" d="5120">Human beings are insufficient in and of themselves and need the movement upward and so they need to</p>
<p t="8616850" d="4129">conceptualize something like the highest good and then to strive for that and</p>
<p t="8621800" d="2690">The thing is is that there isn't any difference</p>
<p t="8625069" d="3530">between conceptualizing the good and being judged</p>
<p t="8629021" d="1139">because if you're going to</p>
<p t="8630160" d="6020">conceptualize the good and move towards it what you have to do is separate from yourself all those things that aren't good and</p>
<p t="8636400" d="4429">leave them behind and that's where the redeemer and the judge are the same thing and</p>
<p t="8641440" d="1820">One of the things that's really appalling</p>
<p t="8643260" d="5430">I think about our modern world is that we're rejecting the notion of qualitative distinctions</p>
<p t="8648690" d="6330">You say well, we don't want to hurt anybody's feelings by saying that one thing is better than another it's like okay fair enough</p>
<p t="8655020" d="5120">It's not fun to be cast off with the damned. That's for sure</p>
<p t="8660320" d="4800">But if people are in fact insufficient in their present condition</p>
<p t="8665820" d="3460">Which seems to be the case; I mean try finding someone who isn't?</p>
<p t="8669640" d="7060">Then if you deny the possibility of qualitative distinction because you want to promote a radical</p>
<p t="8677050" d="6890">egalitarianism then you remove the possibility of redemption because there's no movement towards the good and it seems to me that it's a</p>
<p t="8684160" d="2629">Catastrophe to sacrifice the good for</p>
<p t="8688391" d="6859">Well, it's a catastrophe to sacrifice the good for the equal; because for us to be equal would be mean as far as I can</p>
<p t="8695250" d="3660">tell that we would all be equally unredeemed and miserable and</p>
<p t="8699460" d="2000">so</p>
<p t="8705280" d="2929">";He also mentioned in the previous paragraph</p>
<p t="8708311" d="6139">I believe that even in the case when you experience the human life at its fullest that it's most</p>
<p t="8714670" d="3680">Beautiful as its most meaningful you have a deep I guess</p>
<p t="8719141" d="4459">Understanding that you have something to be thankful for you need to thank somebody for that</p>
<p t="8723601" d="2250">It's not based entirely on your own merit and that</p>

<p t="8732220" d="1410">experience</p>
<p t="8733630" d="2900">You know in the best sense without that accompanying it</p>
<p t="8737050" d="5030">That's a feeling of being blessed. It's something like that. Yeah. That's a good oh</p>
<p t="8743710" d="2030">Wait hold it. I'm going to stop you</p>
<p t="8745740" d="6419">Okay, because I'm going to ask this person, but I would like to say that those were remarkably good questions</p>
<p t="8752740" d="2000">so</p>
<p t="8760200" d="2809">";Dr. Peterson, thank you for the wonderful lecture</p>
<p t="8764280" d="2059">given your working definition of truth and</p>
<p t="8767250" d="6410">And let's say within the abrahamic religious tradition would you say that the more perhaps</p>
<p t="8774200" d="2000">mystical sects and denominations</p>
<p t="8776600" d="2500">which place more emphasis on the</p>
<p t="8780280" d="2960">transcendental experience of God also on this experience</p>
<p t="8784320" d="3349">as opposed to the more fundamentalist, Orthodox</p>
<p t="8788460" d="2000">literalist which perhaps</p>
<p t="8790620" d="2080">Emphasize that what I've noticed</p>
<p t="8795360" d="6440">Moral policing of behaviors"; yeah? ";would you say that the former is more true than the latter?"; no. ";and--";</p>
<p t="8802520" d="7760">no. and and okay, sorry continue. ";And B: could the former in some ways serve as an antidote to</p>
<p t="8810500" d="2100">extremists literalism, Jihadism</p>
<p t="8813900" d="5120">Fundamentalism?"; okay, so yes to the second part, but the first part it's a great question</p>
<p t="8819271" d="4129">We did some research on this a while back because we're looking at</p>
<p t="8824070" d="3109">the different religious proclivities of liberals and conservatives and</p>
<p t="8828180" d="5000">Liberals like if you're liberal it means you're high in openness and low in conscientiousness, and if you're conservative</p>
<p t="8833180" d="6300">Then you're high and conscientiousness and low and openness and that the liberals are spiritual and the conservatives are dogmatic</p>
<p t="8840210" d="2000">but it's best to think of those as</p>
<p t="8843030" d="2570">partners, right? because the</p>
<p t="8846391" d="7250">spiritual mystical end is where the revelations Emerge and the renewal, but that's where there's Chaos and and</p>
<p t="8854340" d="3470">Discord as well, because what's new disrupts what's stable</p>
<p t="8857811" d="1299">and so</p>
<p t="8859110" d="1770">What's new has to be turned into...</p>
<p t="8860880" d="2330">It has to be integrated into what's stable</p>
<p t="8863210" d="4410">And so you need both those poles and of course if the dogmatists get the upper-hand then everything</p>
<p t="8867840" d="6740">turns into a Tyranny of stone that that's egypt in the old testament, but if the if the if the</p>
<p t="8875340" d="3830">Mystics get the upper hand then everything floats off the earth into some</p>
<p t="8879780" d="3919">impractical ether that is equally counterproductive, and so there has to be a</p>
<p t="8884311" d="1729">dialogue between those different poles</p>
<p t="8886040" d="3299">And I think you see that in the distribution of human temperament</p>
<p t="8889460" d="6330">You know the conscientious types there they tend to be orderly the orderly types tend to tend towards kind of a right-wing</p>
<p t="8896430" d="6830">Totalitarianism that's their proclivity when they when they when things get out of hand especially if they're low in openness, that's a danger</p>
<p t="8904350" d="1560">but</p>
<p t="8905910" d="3589">You see the same thing with the people who are too open and not conscientious at all</p>
<p t="8909540" d="6260">They're dreaming all the time, but they never do anything. There's never anything implemented and that that's bad. That's a bad thing</p>
<p t="8916700" d="6980">So I don't think that you can say that like- the dogmatic structure is necessary because that perpetuates the system and the revelatory</p>
<p t="8923900" d="5800">Element is necessary because that renews it when renewal is necessary and there has to be a continual dialogue between those elements</p>
<p t="8930000" d="6950">So that neither of them fall prey to their own particular form of Pathology that's one of the problems with the current political</p>
<p t="8938250" d="2000">What would you call it?</p>
<p t="8940560" d="4759">Polarization that's occurring across the west is that the right and the left and are talking to each other anymore.</p>
<p t="8945540" d="2209">That's a very bad thing because the left will</p>
<p t="8948390" d="2660">wander into a pit and fail without</p>
<p t="8952439" d="6440">boundaries and the right will enclose itself in smaller and smaller spaces until it can't move without the left and</p>
<p t="8959069" d="6890">One of the reasons that democracy works is because it makes people talk; or allows them to talk you can have it either way</p>
<p t="8966600" d="2000">but it's in its bits because</p>
<p t="8969540" d="2000">Every virtue has its vice</p>
<p t="8972120" d="6559">right and so a meta virtue is something like the amalgamation of singular virtues into something that's a</p>
<p t="8979020" d="4940">Transcendent structure that has more to do with the harmony of virtues rather than with any given virtue</p>
<p t="8984479" d="7490">even though I think that freedom of speech is the clearest manifestation of that harmony of virtues, so and</p>
<p t="8992609" d="5959">";So all could be a lubricant for the beginning of this discussion. Do you think between the liberals and conservatives?";</p>
<p t="9004000" d="2000">I don't know how to answer that</p>
<p t="9008980" d="6680">It doesn't follow immediately from your from your initial presupposition, so the awe experience is a different issue</p>
<p t="9015660" d="1940">";[Unintelligible]";</p>
<p t="9017600" d="2000">Yeah, we'll be able</p>
<p t="9020060" d="7760">Yes, ";at least exposing conservatives to some form of that experience could it be if we requisite for a more productive dialogue?";</p>
<p t="9031060" d="5480">See I mean in it in in in the church in church ceremony let's say a classical church ceremony</p>
<p t="9036800" d="5480">There's some intermingling of both right you mean you think about a church ceremony that takes place in the Gothic cathedral</p>
<p t="9042500" d="5000">We've certainly got the dogma and they're under and the relatively rigid rule structure</p>
<p t="9047630" d="3139">but at the same time that's aligned with intense beauty and</p>
<p t="9051170" d="4549">In the architectural forms in the in the light that's streaming in through the stained-glass</p>
<p t="9055970" d="7970">windows and the music and I mean the Gothic cathedrals are forests right it's a stone forest with sunlight streaming in through the Trees and</p>
<p t="9064670" d="2780">It's a balance between structure light there are absolutely</p>
<p t="9067940" d="1040">unbelievable structures</p>
<p t="9068980" d="5399">And they speak of the transcendent but but inside that there's a structure and so it</p>
<p t="9074660" d="5030">Seems that in order for the religious impulse to be balanced properly there has to be a reasonable</p>
<p t="9080930" d="7129">dialogue even in practice between the mystical awe-inspiring transcendent and the dogmatic yeah either of those can</p>
<p t="9088400" d="4759">Can go as either those goes astray without the other if you're too dogmatic. Do you need aw?</p>
<p t="9095090" d="6440">likely yes, because that would show you that there's something beyond your own presuppositions, so</p>
<p t="9103130" d="5240">So awe, I should tell you something interesting about awe as a as a physiological phenomena</p>
<p t="9108370" d="2250">You know how you're listening to music and you get chills?</p>
<p t="9111680" d="4940">Some people experience that more than others open people experience that more or music is a pretty</p>
<p t="9118010" d="2000">reliable</p>
<p t="9120380" d="1860">elicitor of</p>
<p t="9122240" d="7939">Chills, that's piloerection. That's your hair standing on end. You see a cat when it sees a dog puffs up. That's awe</p>
<p t="9131200" d="3780">It's the same thing like that that chill is your hair standing on end</p>
<p t="9134980" d="5920">And that's this that's sensation you get in the presence of a meta predator</p>
<p t="9140908" d="2492">It's something like that and so the awe</p>
<p t="9144010" d="1740">experience is a</p>
<p t="9145750" d="5449">I mean obviously it's become very cognitively and emotionally complex in human beings, but it's fundamental</p>
<p t="9151869" d="1891">evolutionary underpinning is</p>
<p t="9153760" d="1080">the Instantaneous</p>
<p t="9154840" d="6259">piloerection that you see in prey animals when they're confronted by a predator and of course that would be if you are a rabbit</p>
<p t="9161100" d="4320">You can bloody well believe that you see a wolf and it would inspire. Awe that's for sure</p>
<p t="9165420" d="6029">I mean if a wolf that was 20 feet high came bounding in here, man, you'd feel awe so</p>
<p t="9172180" d="3589">Yeah, that will convince you that there's something that you still need to know</p>
<p t="9179170" d="1140">last</p>
<p t="9180310" d="1799">last question</p>
<p t="9182109" d="2270">";Perfect timing. Hi, Dr. Peterson</p>
<p t="9184380" d="5040">My name is Gary, and I'm a clinical and counseling master student right now and so one of the key ideas</p>
<p t="9189540" d="2120">That's been surfacing time and time again in your</p>
<p t="9192300" d="2000">Lectures is the idea that</p>
<p t="9194350" d="2269">Phenomenology is structured and flows</p>
<p t="9197350" d="2000">mythologically and</p>
<p t="9200109" d="2570">the way that plays out is I'm</p>
<p t="9203920" d="4339">supposing effectively just pay attention to what comes up kind of</p>
<p t="9208869" d="3620">naturally and you can locate the chaotic elements in your experience and</p>
<p t="9212920" d="4250">Prod at them with whatever degree of Necessity you think so</p>
<p t="9217930" d="2030">trying to situate this within the clinical</p>
<p t="9220720" d="2000">context</p>
<p t="9223000" d="2000">We can conceptualize</p>
<p t="9226119" d="4340">Psychotherapy as a kind of guided journey just as you touched on in this lecture</p>
<p t="9231460" d="4939">Where it's more of a meta journey in a sense a meta heroic journey if I don't know how you want to think about it</p>
<p t="9236439" d="1351">but</p>
<p t="9237790" d="5569">Just for those of us who are interested in kind of grounding and implementing these ideas within?</p>
<p t="9244060" d="1410">psychotherapeutic practice</p>
<p t="9245470" d="3080">What should we watch out for in the process itself?</p>
<p t="9249159" d="6500">What comes up? What should we be afraid of or fearful of or cautious about or what should we tend towards that's my question";</p>
<p t="9257529" d="2419">Well, I think one of it</p>
<p t="9261369" d="3140">One of the people who I've read that's had the biggest</p>
<p t="9265810" d="2719">Impact on me as a Clinician was carl Rogers</p>
<p t="9270230" d="4530">And the reason for that is that carl Rogers put tremendous emphasis on listening.</p>
<p t="9275400" d="7070">Like it's almost impossible to overestimate how useful it is to listen to your clients like you need a meta</p>
<p t="9282750" d="2000">Scheme in some sense and</p>
<p t="9285000" d="5150">The meta Scheme, I think is laid out in the sermon on the mount. It's something like</p>
<p t="9291330" d="2120">orient yourself and your client</p>
<p t="9294511" d="2000">Towards the good</p>
<p t="9296580" d="4190">The client has to conceptualize what that might be you can serve as a guide</p>
<p t="9300771" d="5879">But it has to come from that person because one of the things that you want to find out from your client is okay</p>
<p t="9306660" d="1710">What's wrong?</p>
<p t="9308370" d="2000">they have to tell you and</p>
<p t="9310771" d="7250">What would not having something wrong look like like what is it if you could have what you wanted and that and that...</p>
<p t="9318330" d="5570">That would be good. What would that look like okay? So that establishes your star, right? It's like Geppetto</p>
<p t="9324511" d="3889">Establishing the relationship with the star at the beginning of pinocchio. Here's what we're aiming at</p>
<p t="9328950" d="1760">Okay, so now you've got that schema</p>
<p t="9330710" d="1061">Here's what we're aiming at</p>
<p t="9331771" d="5929">now you might say you might think well now that what happens to the client is they meet their dragons along the way and</p>
<p t="9337980" d="2179">The dragons would be well now</p>
<p t="9340160" d="750">You know what you want,</p>
<p t="9340910" d="6299">And there are things in your way and some of those things might many of those things are going to be intensely practical</p>
<p t="9347210" d="1960">But they're practical/</p>
<p t="9349170" d="4970">Psychological so like so maybe someone is has a job and they would like to move forward in the job</p>
<p t="9354141" d="2000">But they're terrified of speaking in public</p>
<p t="9356280" d="2990">Well, you know is that a psychological problem or a practical problem?</p>
<p t="9359880" d="740">It's both</p>
<p t="9360620" d="3959">It's also a real problem in many positions unless you can speak fluently</p>
<p t="9364860" d="4549">Publicly you're you're going to hit a ceiling and you're not going to go anywhere and so</p>
<p t="9370021" d="3530">For the person to move towards that goal</p>
<p t="9374820" d="3740">Then they have to confront the obstacles that manifest themselves</p>
<p t="9378960" d="4200">Within that framework and part of your job as a clinician is to identify the obstacles</p>
<p t="9383250" d="5209">And to discriminate them from things they don't have to worry about right part of it is</p>
<p t="9388891" d="2450">you know you can't just run around and try to</p>
<p t="9391891" d="5870">Combat all the Chaos in the world some of it is your Chaos and a bunch of it isn't and the Chaos</p>
<p t="9397761" d="3539">That's yours is the Chaos that emerges as you move towards a necessary goal</p>
<p t="9401460" d="5280">And so partly what you're doing by listening to your client is to help them cut their dragons down to size</p>
<p t="9406940" d="5000">You know because what will happen if you start to talk to somebody about public speaking and you really talk to them</p>
<p t="9411940" d="5840">Is that you decompose the problem into a set of maybe 20 subproblems like well</p>
<p t="9417800" d="3450">Do you know exactly how to give a speech? What's your theory of</p>
<p t="9422250" d="5450">Public speaking? Do you know how to look at people when you're talking? Do you know how to speak loudly enough?</p>
<p t="9427700" d="3239">so that people can hear you? do you have a philosophy of</p>
<p t="9431790" d="5870">Public speaking? you know all those things are necessary in order to do it properly you need to decompose that with the client and then to</p>
<p t="9437850" d="6049">Make those problems you have to decompose them to the point where they can be met by a practical solution</p>
<p t="9443910" d="4339">and then you have to guide the person through the implementation of the practical solution and</p>
<p t="9450029" d="2180">Mostly you do that by by listening</p>
<p t="9452520" d="3680">It's like the what you need to be is the person who helps the person</p>
<p t="9456510" d="2870">That you're working with orient themselves towards a better future</p>
<p t="9459590" d="5129">That's the compact you and I are in this space at this time to make things better</p>
<p t="9465840" d="2689">first of all we have to decide what better would look like and</p>
<p t="9469080" d="2359">Second we need a strategy and third</p>
<p t="9471439" d="761">we need to</p>
<p t="9472200" d="3349">Once we have that we're going to see the obstacles and some of those are going to be</p>
<p t="9475680" d="3500">Psychological and some of them are going to be practical and we're going to engage in joint</p>
<p t="9479790" d="3109">problem-solving of whatever, sort is necessary in order to</p>
<p t="9484529" d="6140">Minimize the impact of those problems or to gain from the problems and dream analysis can be extremely useful for that by the way</p>
<p t="9491010" d="6530">It's even more useful for helping the person identify what the goal is because that's often difficult for people. It's like well</p>
<p t="9497540" d="989">I know that something's wrong</p>
<p t="9498529" d="5760">But I don't know what I want. sometimes people get so stuck there that they just can't get they just can't get out of it</p>
<p t="9505080" d="2299">So and then what would you watch out for?</p>
<p t="9509279" d="3950">";Phenomenologically. The way it shows up, The way, It's experienced";</p>
<p t="9514560" d="3890">Well, I would say the clinician one of the things that you should watch out for is resentment</p>
<p t="9519300" d="3740">So there's a there's a couple of rules of thumb that I think are useful</p>
<p t="9523200" d="4250">Don't do anything for your clients that they can do for themselves and don't do them any favors?</p>
<p t="9528720" d="2179">Now I think you can step</p>
<p t="9531810" d="2509">Beyond the confines of your role</p>
<p t="9535410" d="2000">carefully now and then</p>
<p t="9539350" d="1830">to show that</p>
<p t="9541180" d="6679">There's there's there's a more human connection than the merely contractual. I think that's very useful but</p>
<p t="9549069" d="3860">Their problems are not your problems you do not have any right to their problems</p>
<p t="9552930" d="4320">And so you have to maintain that detachment because otherwise you can steal their destiny</p>
<p t="9557380" d="4849">You don't want to be the person that solves their problems because you steal their destiny when you do that</p>
<p t="9562359" d="3830">You want to be someone with whom they can figure things out for themselves?</p>
<p t="9566260" d="6290">And so there can be hubris in being a clinician because you can be the problem solver and that elevates you to a position</p>
<p t="9572979" d="2839">You elevate yourself to that position. You'll fall flat on your face</p>
<p t="9575890" d="5030">You'll hurt your clients and things will kick back on you very very hard because what the hell. Do you know?</p>
<p t="9581560" d="1020">right</p>
<p t="9582580" d="7189">Nothing because that person is very complicated and they need to they need to sort themselves out and but you can be a facilitator</p>
<p t="9589960" d="2000">For that, but that's all you should be</p>
<p t="9592479" d="2450">And so you have to watch that you have to watch over</p>
<p t="9595689" d="6650">becoming over and k over ly entangled so you have to maintain your detachment in the best sense, and you have to not overstep your</p>
<p t="9602890" d="4280">It's easy to become hubristic when the person is looking to you for the answers</p>
<p t="9607630" d="5839">It's like you might you don't have the answers although you might be able to find help the person find their way</p>
<p t="9613990" d="2269">That's what you do with everyone. You love - right?</p>
<p t="9616260" d="6540">I mean, you don't provide them with the answers because then they become little clones of you and</p>
<p t="9623649" d="6410">unhappy bitter resentful and Angry little clones of you because you usurped their destiny and</p>
<p t="9630819" d="2000">so</p>
<p t="9632830" d="5689">the same thing applies within familiar Arrangements or friendships all about it, so</p>
