<p t="2490" d="9620">So last time, we talked a little bit about
the state of the world of belief, I suppose,</p>
<p t="12110" d="5390">by the end of the nineteenth century and I
talked to you a little about Nietzsche, and</p>
<p t="17500" d="3630">Dostoevsky, and Kierkegaard.</p>
<p t="21130" d="8659">Um, a very large number of the clinical theories
that we’re going to be discussing for another</p>
<p t="29789" d="6341">two lectures after this one have been influenced
by philosophers, and that&#39;s partly why I’m</p>
<p t="36130" d="2980">also talking to you about the philosophers.</p>
<p t="39110" d="9740">It’s almost as if in some sense the great
philosophers have - are tapped directly into</p>
<p t="48850" d="8910">the lower strata of our cultural systems of
meaning as they move forward in time, and</p>
<p t="57760" d="5750">they can outline what those structures are
and also describe their weaknesses, and their</p>
<p t="63510" d="4610">strengths, and their likely transformations
moving forward.</p>
<p t="68120" d="7230">You know, I mean obviously people can be behind
the times, and it’s just as probable that</p>
<p t="75350" d="5049">some people are ahead of the times and we
would assume, if you&#39;re thinking about it,</p>
<p t="80399" d="5421">say, from a Big Five trait perspective that
the people who are ahead of the times often</p>
<p t="85820" d="5159">are very, very intelligent and very, very
open, and of course that&#39;s a pretty good definition</p>
<p t="90979" d="3291">of a philosopher.</p>
<p t="94270" d="8940">So, Nietzsche and Dostoevsky, more than any
other two thinkers had their finger on the</p>
<p t="103210" d="9960">pulse of the transmutation of cultural systems
of meaning at the end of the nineteenth century,</p>
<p t="113170" d="8039">and they were both concerned about the fact
that the systems of meaning within which Western</p>
<p t="121209" d="8500">civilization at least had taken shape, had
been fragmented for a variety of reasons,</p>
<p t="129709" d="7561">the most important of which was likely the
rise of the scientific worldview, and as I</p>
<p t="137270" d="6700">detailed to you in the last lecture, both
Dostoevsky and Nietzsche believed that that</p>
<p t="143970" d="5450">had left modern people because I think in
the early twentieth century, it was Western</p>
<p t="149420" d="6550">people but I now think it’s reasonable to
say that it’s modern people in a state of</p>
<p t="155970" d="5240">- they&#39;re - of cultural discontinuity.</p>
<p t="161210" d="7320">The things - belief systems but also technological
systems now have transformed the world so</p>
<p t="168530" d="6900">radically that the conflict between modernism
and traditional forms of belief is acutely</p>
<p t="175430" d="2020">felt everywhere.</p>
<p t="177450" d="8650">It’s certainly, I think, one of the forces
that have given rise to the battle between</p>
<p t="186100" d="7520">Islamic fundamentalism and modernism because
it’s more than a battle of Islamic fundamentalism</p>
<p t="193620" d="7430">against the Western world, and the problem,
fundamentally, is that people typically exist</p>
<p t="201050" d="6430">within cultural constructs that are very,
very ancient, and that have - that are grounded</p>
<p t="207480" d="7360">in evolved systems of meaning that are even
deeper than the ones that are articulated</p>
<p t="214840" d="7220">and explicit, and when there&#39;s a period of
very, very rapid cognitive and technological</p>
<p t="222060" d="8930">change, then the integrity of those systems
starts to… it starts to become questionable</p>
<p t="230990" d="6630">from an explicit perspective but it also starts
to become insufficient from a practical perspective.</p>
<p t="237620" d="6940">So, one example that you might give some consideration
to is the fact of the introduction of the</p>
<p t="244560" d="2520">birth control pill, for example.</p>
<p t="247080" d="9200">If you listen to politically minded people,
they make the case that the emancipation of</p>
<p t="256280" d="5540">women was essentially a political matter,
but I don&#39;t think that&#39;s a very reasonable</p>
<p t="261820" d="1909">way of looking at it at all.</p>
<p t="263729" d="6761">Of course, everything feeds back onto itself
and there are multiple causal pathways to</p>
<p t="270490" d="1880">any end.</p>
<p t="272370" d="6769">The radical element in the emancipation of
women was of course the development of efficient</p>
<p t="279139" d="6090">forms of contraception, most particularly
the birth control pill, and it’s the case</p>
<p t="285229" d="5831">that as soon as you educate women anywhere
in the world, not only does economic productivity</p>
<p t="291060" d="4680">arise dramatically, in fact it’s actually
the best predictor of increasing economic</p>
<p t="295740" d="4120">productivity in a modernizing state is the
granting of rights to women.</p>
<p t="299860" d="6139">Now whether it’s directly because of the
granting of rights to women or because of</p>
<p t="305999" d="5320">the existence of an underlying belief structure
that allows the concept of right to expand</p>
<p t="311319" d="5972">quite rapidly is a very difficult to be sure
of, but in any case that exists, and then</p>
<p t="317291" d="5729">of course the other thing that happens is
that women stop having children unbelievably</p>
<p t="323020" d="1290">rapidly.</p>
<p t="324310" d="7169">So for example, I think - I believe it’s
Iran where this has been most marked over</p>
<p t="331479" d="5981">the last two generations, so from family sizes
far greater than replacement to family sizes</p>
<p t="337460" d="3679">well below replacement in basically one or
two generations.</p>
<p t="341139" d="4081">It’s a massive transformation, and it’s
not necessarily something that anyone expected.</p>
<p t="345220" d="8529">It’s part of the sequence of forces that
are rapidly allowing our population to reach</p>
<p t="353749" d="2280">a peak and either stabilize or decline.</p>
<p t="356029" d="4390">Now I don&#39;t know how many of you know this,
but the projections are there’ll be nine</p>
<p t="360419" d="4821">billion people on the Earth within thirty
to fifty years, and that’ll be our peak</p>
<p t="365240" d="1079">population.</p>
<p t="366319" d="4541">After that it will fall rapidly, and you know,
you can see that sort of thing happening right</p>
<p t="370860" d="3790">now all over the Western world, and it’s
happening a lot in China, and it’s happening</p>
<p t="374650" d="4049">a lot in Japan where, you know, there are
more older people than there are younger people</p>
<p t="378699" d="4881">because the younger people aren&#39;t having enough
children to actually replace the population.</p>
<p t="383580" d="4470">So the probability that we’ll peak at about
nine billion and then start to fall, it’s</p>
<p t="388050" d="4889">not certain but that’s what the best projections
seem to indicate now.</p>
<p t="392939" d="6931">So what happens anyways with in periods of
very rapid technological and cognitive transformation</p>
<p t="399870" d="6129">because those things go together that the
certainties upon which people base their interpretation</p>
<p t="405999" d="8481">of the world and even more importantly, base
their judgements about how to act start to</p>
<p t="414480" d="1850">become uncertain.</p>
<p t="416330" d="5320">So for example, if you introduce the birth
control pill into a population, and you put</p>
<p t="421650" d="7199">women’s reproductive faculties under their
own voluntary choice, then you radically transform</p>
<p t="428849" d="6471">virtually all of society’s fundamental social
structures, not least marriage, and marriage</p>
<p t="435320" d="7830">of course has been regarded classically as
the foundation of civilization, and of course,</p>
<p t="443150" d="5379">increasingly there are more people who aren&#39;t
married than there are people who are married.</p>
<p t="448529" d="5551">Now, it’s very difficult to know what to
make of that because of course there&#39;s no</p>
<p t="454080" d="6989">setting the clock back, and it’s not even
clear that you would want to set back the</p>
<p t="461069" d="6460">clock if you could, but expecting cultural
constructs, which take centuries or maybe</p>
<p t="467529" d="5031">even thousands or maybe even tens of thousands
of years to develop, to keep up with change</p>
<p t="472560" d="3960">of that magnitude is...it’s not possible.</p>
<p t="476520" d="6649">You know, I mean and you guys face technological
transformations that are earth-shattering</p>
<p t="483169" d="3000">on an almost yearly basis, and you hardly
even notice it.</p>
<p t="486169" d="3381">I mean, Tinder is a good example of that,
you know.</p>
<p t="489550" d="3000">I don’t know if you know, but Tinder has
produced quite a spike in sexually transmitted</p>
<p t="492550" d="4829">diseases, but you know, it’s a radical technology
because it’s the first technology that’s</p>
<p t="497379" d="6831">ever been invented that enables men to find
partners with no fear - with virtually no</p>
<p t="504210" d="5909">fear of rejection, and of course that&#39;s been
a limiting factor for… that’s been a defining</p>
<p t="510119" d="5631">feature between the interactions between men
and women ever since history began, and so</p>
<p t="515750" d="7130">these things are occurring at an extraordinary
rate, and of course it’s not reasonable</p>
<p t="522880" d="5810">to expect our more slower moving cultural
constructs to keep up with them, and that’s</p>
<p t="528690" d="4920">partly because as well that, you know, people
talk for example about the divisive nature</p>
<p t="533610" d="1000">of religion.</p>
<p t="534610" d="4740">You often hear people who are critics of formal
religion in particular talk about the fact</p>
<p t="539350" d="5690">that religion underlies a tremendous amount
of destruction and warfare and conflict, and</p>
<p t="545040" d="4659">you know, first of all it isn&#39;t religion that
does that by the way, it’s tribalism, and</p>
<p t="549699" d="4711">tribalism characterizes even chimpanzees,
and I don&#39;t think chimpanzees go to war with</p>
<p t="554410" d="2100">each other for religious reasons.</p>
<p t="556510" d="6530">So, you know, the religious groupings of mankind
are large-scale manifestations of the same</p>
<p t="563040" d="5880">phenomena that produce dominance hierarchies
in the wild, and of course, large-scale religions</p>
<p t="568920" d="5200">unite people within the religion just as much
as they divide people on the outside of it,</p>
<p t="574120" d="6500">so part of the accumulation of religious tradition
across time is a process that allows thousands,</p>
<p t="580620" d="6000">and ten thousands, and even millions of people
to exist within the same hierarchy of values</p>
<p t="586620" d="2529">and exist relatively peacefully as a consequence.</p>
<p t="589149" d="3321">Now I’m saying relatively peacefully.</p>
<p t="592470" d="7860">You know, a hundred years ago, it was thought
that pre, let&#39;s say archaic people, so those</p>
<p t="600330" d="4610">would be people who are still living a fairly
isolated tribal life in small groups - pre</p>
<p t="604940" d="4589">- you know, basically operating at the level
of stone age technology, let’s say.</p>
<p t="609529" d="6721">The idea was - there was a very popular idea
for a long time that those cultures were communistic</p>
<p t="616250" d="3370">and violence free, and that&#39;s wrong.</p>
<p t="619620" d="1290">They&#39;re not violence free at all.</p>
<p t="620910" d="4510">If you track the homicide rates in stone-age
cultures, they&#39;re way, way higher than they</p>
<p t="625420" d="5060">are in civilized cultures, like orders of
magnitudes higher, and there&#39;s a variety of</p>
<p t="630480" d="4561">reasons for that, but I’m just telling you
that because you want to dispense with the</p>
<p t="635041" d="5709">idea that along with complex civilizations
and the spread, say, of unifying religious</p>
<p t="640750" d="4480">beliefs, there was an increase in baseline
violence because there&#39;s just no evidence</p>
<p t="645230" d="1109">for that at all.</p>
<p t="646339" d="6211">Now, the problem with these large-scale belief
systems is they&#39;re not very fast, and part</p>
<p t="652550" d="8589">of the reason for that is that in order for
a large-scale belief system to manifest itself</p>
<p t="661139" d="7250">in any reasonable form, it has to be predicated
on the mutual agreement of the people within</p>
<p t="668389" d="6301">who...within - who operate within its embrace,
you know.</p>
<p t="674690" d="6709">So, for Toronto to exist as city, as a peaceful
city, basically what has to happen is that</p>
<p t="681399" d="5951">the vast majority of us have to agree that
the rules that govern the city, and the social</p>
<p t="687350" d="6969">interactions within the city are useful and
just, and because if you don&#39;t agree with</p>
<p t="694319" d="5541">that, then splinter movements of all sorts
start to occur and people become more revolutionary</p>
<p t="699860" d="3959">in their modes of action and then they become
more violent and the whole system starts to</p>
<p t="703819" d="1000">break down.</p>
<p t="704819" d="7221">So it’s not easy to establish a collective
norm because people have to agree to it, and</p>
<p t="712040" d="5169">you can imagine that hammering out agreement
with anything, with even a small agreement</p>
<p t="717209" d="4611">that affects many, many people, is a process
that takes a tremendous amount of time.</p>
<p t="721820" d="5220">People can argue forever about the smallest
alterations in the systems that regulate our</p>
<p t="727040" d="1000">behavior.</p>
<p t="728040" d="5220">Now, you know, some of you might be familiar
with the terror management theories.</p>
<p t="733260" d="2650">How many of you have heard of terror management
theory?</p>
<p t="735910" d="5240">Okay, well the terror management theories
are predicated on the idea that our belief</p>
<p t="741150" d="2990">systems protect us from our fear of death.</p>
<p t="744140" d="4430">Now exactly how they do that isn&#39;t specified
particularly well in the terror management</p>
<p t="748570" d="5390">theories but the originator of the theory
- his name was Ernest Becker who was a sociologist,</p>
<p t="753960" d="8810">by the way, and a Freudian - believed that
cultural systems enabled us to attribute beliefs</p>
<p t="762770" d="6359">to our actions, finite and infinite, so that
we could consider ourselves in relationship</p>
<p t="769129" d="5500">to mortality and in some sense, hide from
the truth of the finitude of our existence.</p>
<p t="774629" d="5171">Now, one of the things that terror management
theorists don&#39;t really give any credence to</p>
<p t="779800" d="5960">is the fact that belief systems are not only
systems of beliefs, they&#39;re systems of action</p>
<p t="785760" d="1879">regulation, right.</p>
<p t="787639" d="3681">So we talked about the Piagetian notion of
a game.</p>
<p t="791320" d="6240">I mean, the game exists first as something
that everyone can play and only later as something</p>
<p t="797560" d="3990">that people represent, and a social culture’s
the same way.</p>
<p t="801550" d="1079">A cultural…</p>
<p t="802629" d="4520">A culture regulates the way that you interact
with each other, and what you expect from</p>
<p t="807149" d="5800">each, and how you can fulfill your mutual
- your needs in relationship to one another</p>
<p t="812949" d="5620">and then it’s represented, and the representation
might help you find meaning in your life,</p>
<p t="818569" d="4911">but the fact of the initial social contract,
which is the phenomena that regulates your</p>
<p t="823480" d="4789">interpersonal behavior, doesn&#39;t protect you
from the fear of death, it protects you from</p>
<p t="828269" d="3671">dying, and that&#39;s a very important thing to
note.</p>
<p t="831940" d="4451">I mean, you know, all of you know, of course,
that it’s very cold out today, and yet here</p>
<p t="836391" d="5508">you are in this classroom where it’s, you
know, ridiculously comfortable, you know,</p>
<p t="841899" d="3971">by classroom standards and of course by standards
around the world.</p>
<p t="845870" d="5180">You&#39;re not freezing to death in here, and
that’s not your belief that’s protecting</p>
<p t="851050" d="1000">you.</p>
<p t="852050" d="4930">It’s the fact that you&#39;re embedded in this
insanely complicated system of cultural interactions</p>
<p t="856980" d="4219">and it just so happens that you get to sit
here and listen to a lecture while there&#39;s</p>
<p t="861199" d="4830">thousands of people beetling around, many
of them outside in the cold, making sure that</p>
<p t="866029" d="4500">the power grid, for example, that keeps this
place warm is properly maintained and functional</p>
<p t="870529" d="3311">which takes a tremendous amount of work.</p>
<p t="873840" d="5780">So, in during periods of rapid transformation,
it’s hard for the social contract to adjust</p>
<p t="879620" d="4290">itself so that everyone knows how to behave
in relationship to one another, but then it’s</p>
<p t="883910" d="5210">also very difficult for the description of
that, so the articulated norms that constitute</p>
<p t="889120" d="5060">a society; it’s very difficult of them to
transform rapidly enough so that they can</p>
<p t="894180" d="8260">keep track of the changes and help people
decide what they should do, so let me give</p>
<p t="902440" d="1000">you an example.</p>
<p t="903440" d="5920">So, I had a client a while back who had been
raised as a fundamentalist Christian, and</p>
<p t="909360" d="8510">she was very… she had been socialized and
had come to believe that sex before marriage</p>
<p t="917870" d="5490">was wrong, but the probability that she was
going to get married before she was 27, or</p>
<p t="923360" d="3169">28, was low for a whole variety of reasons.</p>
<p t="926529" d="3990">So then she faced this conundrum, and it was
an interesting conundrum from my perspective</p>
<p t="930519" d="9920">because, you know, I think that in a well-regulated
psyche, sexuality is integrated into the personality</p>
<p t="940439" d="5400">so that it plays its role in the - what would
you call - in the polity of the self.</p>
<p t="945839" d="6360">It’s integrated properly inside, and so
it’s under moral control, roughly speaking</p>
<p t="952199" d="6161">because it serves its own function plus the
function of keeping the person well situated</p>
<p t="958360" d="4680">in the present and developing properly in
the future, and maintaining proper relationships</p>
<p t="963040" d="5020">with everyone around them, but it was quite
obvious to me that a lot of the constraints</p>
<p t="968060" d="4189">that had been placed on her behavior, as a
consequence of her relatively rigid belief</p>
<p t="972249" d="4521">were actually interfering with her development
as a person, you know, and so one of the things</p>
<p t="976770" d="6830">we had to puzzle out was well, exactly what
are the moral guidelines that you should use</p>
<p t="983600" d="4669">to regulate your sexual behavior outside of
marriage if you&#39;re not planning to be married</p>
<p t="988269" d="1810">for, you know, maybe until your late twenties.</p>
<p t="990079" d="3351">Well, you know good luck trying to figure
that out.</p>
<p t="993430" d="4649">Like it’s a really - it’s a really, really,
really, really complicated question, and it’s</p>
<p t="998079" d="5721">certainly not obvious that any one person
can figure out the answer to that in a single</p>
<p t="1003800" d="5180">lifetime, you know, even if they thought of
nothing else especially because the landscape</p>
<p t="1008980" d="5990">itself is transforming as you&#39;re attempting
to adjust to it, and you know, we eventually</p>
<p t="1014970" d="4380">concluded - although it was a very individual
solution - we eventually concluded that there</p>
<p t="1019350" d="5400">were things that she had forbidden herself
to do that were stopping her from establishing</p>
<p t="1024750" d="4650">any kind of long term relationship at all,
and that was interfering with her development,</p>
<p t="1029400" d="4799">you know, as a mature person, and that the
morality that she had used to structure her</p>
<p t="1034199" d="5321">behavior appeared to be counterproductive
at least in, you know, some - in some areas.</p>
<p t="1039520" d="7299">So, it’s one thing to, you know, to regulate
sexuality in the hopes of marriage when you</p>
<p t="1046819" d="2921">get married when you&#39;re, you know, 19 or 20
or 21.</p>
<p t="1049740" d="3039">It’s a completely different thing, perhaps,
when it’s not going to happen until you&#39;re</p>
<p t="1052779" d="2091">in your late twenties.</p>
<p t="1054870" d="7299">So now, Nietzsche talked a lot, and Dostoevsky
talked a lot about the collapse of meaning</p>
<p t="1062169" d="5831">systems in the late nineteenth century, and
you know, that was followed by a very, very</p>
<p t="1068000" d="5020">rapid period of technological transformation,
like that really kicked in in the late 1800’s,</p>
<p t="1073020" d="5100">which was the, you know, well it was the height
of the industrial revolution, particularly</p>
<p t="1078120" d="6260">in England, and there were modern technologies
being thrust out of the industrial revolution</p>
<p t="1084380" d="4360">like mad, like the automobile, and the airplane,
and the electrical light, and the recording</p>
<p t="1088740" d="8700">devices, and all the things that we’re still
elaborating on now, and then of course, apart</p>
<p t="1097440" d="5590">from the collapse of classic, say, Christian
belief, and the introduction of all these</p>
<p t="1103030" d="4970">new technologies, when World War I hit, the
entire monarchical structure of the Western</p>
<p t="1108000" d="5029">world collapsed and that also occurred, say,
with regards to the Ottoman Empire, and that</p>
<p t="1113029" d="5171">was partly what led to the creation of the
modern Middle East, and of course, that still</p>
<p t="1118200" d="2900">hasn&#39;t been sorted out to any greater degree
at all.</p>
<p t="1121100" d="4960">So the monarchical structures collapsed, these
ancient civilizations.</p>
<p t="1126060" d="6340">The Russians underwent their revolution, and
were transformed into Communists, and then</p>
<p t="1132400" d="8220">after World War I, the stress between the
potential different ways of structuring societies</p>
<p t="1140620" d="5350">after the monarchical societies had collapsed
was almost unbearable, and people didn&#39;t really</p>
<p t="1145970" d="1810">know what to do.</p>
<p t="1147780" d="7249">Now, what happened at the end of Nietzsche’s
period and Dostoevsky’s period was that</p>
<p t="1155029" d="3881">the question that both of those people...what?</p>
<p t="1158910" d="7540">The most important question both of those
people asked became the central focus of the</p>
<p t="1166450" d="3460">development of philosophical idea of ethics
in the twentieth century.</p>
<p t="1169910" d="3450">So you could think about those - about that
as a post-religious ethic.</p>
<p t="1173360" d="5300">Now, the reason I’m telling you this is
because, among other things, is because a</p>
<p t="1178660" d="8370">lot of what psychoanalytic, or psychotherapeutic
treatment is about, is about ethics, and that</p>
<p t="1187030" d="3840">can&#39;t be stretched too much because ethics
is about how you see the world and how you</p>
<p t="1190870" d="7820">behave, and so even behaviorists who are technically
embedded in the scientific world are still</p>
<p t="1198690" d="6880">practical ethicists because what they&#39;re consistently
doing with their clients is breaking down</p>
<p t="1205570" d="4839">whatever the problems are that are causing
them misery, breaking them down into subproblems</p>
<p t="1210409" d="4821">and trying to figure out solutions that improve
their quality of life, like practical, implementable</p>
<p t="1215230" d="5120">solutions that improve their quality of life
not only now, but as they propagate into the</p>
<p t="1220350" d="2360">future, and that is not a scientific issue.</p>
<p t="1222710" d="2560">It’s a how to live issue.</p>
<p t="1225270" d="7070">So, the entire history of the twentieth century,
in some sense, political, economic, psychological,</p>
<p t="1232340" d="8030">was a sequence of attempts to answer the question
“When your fundamental systems of ethics</p>
<p t="1240370" d="2510">collapse, how is is that you should live?”</p>
<p t="1242880" d="6010">Now, Nietzsche said, very clearly, that there’d
be two consequences to the collapse of these</p>
<p t="1248890" d="5419">systems, and one would be nihilism, the belief
in nothing at all, which also regarded as</p>
<p t="1254309" d="5651">a form of escape from responsibility, so it’s
a logical consequence of the breakdown of</p>
<p t="1259960" d="5150">classical belief systems, but it’s also
a cop-out and it’s the kind of cop-out that</p>
<p t="1265110" d="5590">Dostoevsky explored very deeply in his small,
brilliant novel, “Notes from Underground”</p>
<p t="1270700" d="5709">which describes a person who’s basically
slipped -- an intelligent person, and an irresponsible</p>
<p t="1276409" d="5941">person, who has basically slipped into a pit
of meaninglessness where he experiences hatred</p>
<p t="1282350" d="4110">and resentment and the desire for revenge,
and all of the sorts of things that would</p>
<p t="1286460" d="5930">-- that afflict someone in the underworld
who’s got nothing to hold them together,</p>
<p t="1292390" d="4340">and then of course, Nietzsche also talked
about the likelihood that people would turn</p>
<p t="1296730" d="6590">to totalitarian belief systems, and he particularly
discussed Communism as a replacement for religious</p>
<p t="1303320" d="1329">belief.</p>
<p t="1304649" d="2611">I can give you a Canadian example of that.</p>
<p t="1307260" d="3240">So, I heard a Gallup pollster one time.</p>
<p t="1310500" d="1480">I was at a conference in Ottawa.</p>
<p t="1311980" d="5270">It’s the only time I’ve ever heard this,
and I think it’s an amazing -- it’s an</p>
<p t="1317250" d="1000">amazing fact.</p>
<p t="1318250" d="6880">They were looking at the probability that
people would be separatists in Quebec, and</p>
<p t="1325130" d="4310">if you were a lapsed Catholic, the probability
that you would be a Separatist was increased</p>
<p t="1329440" d="5729">ten times, and the reason for that is, you
know, Catholicism fell apart in Quebec in</p>
<p t="1335169" d="1000">the late 1950s.</p>
<p t="1336169" d="8771">It was one of the last places in the Western
world, roughly speaking, where the feudal,</p>
<p t="1344940" d="4700">in some sense, structures of Catholicism had
maintained themselves right up to that point,</p>
<p t="1349640" d="6220">right up to the 1950s, the late 1950s, and
that collapsed precipitously just like belief</p>
<p t="1355860" d="5419">in Christianity had in Russia, you know, in
the late, say, 1880s, and what happened in</p>
<p t="1361279" d="2601">Quebec was, well first of all, the birth rate
plummeted.</p>
<p t="1363880" d="5500">I mean, I did genetic research in Quebec,
and in the 1950s and before that, it was very</p>
<p t="1369380" d="5440">typical to see families of nine to thirteen
children, and of course - but now Quebec has</p>
<p t="1374820" d="2170">the lowest birth rate, I believe, in the Western
world.</p>
<p t="1376990" d="1560">It’s way below replacement.</p>
<p t="1378550" d="1629">Everybody bailed out of the church.</p>
<p t="1380179" d="4311">Nobody gets married, and if you were a separatist
- if you were a lapsed Catholic, you were</p>
<p t="1384490" d="2670">ten times more likely to be a separatist.</p>
<p t="1387160" d="5620">All that meant was that when Catholicism fell
apart, you know, people who still needed to</p>
<p t="1392780" d="5300">have very structured belief systems just turned
to Nationalism as a natural alternative, and</p>
<p t="1398080" d="7300">that&#39;s part of what a -- that’s part of
what accounted for the rigidity and utopian…</p>
<p t="1405380" d="5920">the utopian nature of the Quebec movement
towards independence.</p>
<p t="1411300" d="5729">You know, I remember talking to one of my
colleagues, very, very intelligent person,</p>
<p t="1417029" d="5591">and you know, I asked him because at that
point, they were predicting that if Quebec</p>
<p t="1422620" d="4630">separated, the Canadian dollar would fall
to forty cents, forty-five cents US, something</p>
<p t="1427250" d="1000">like that.</p>
<p t="1428250" d="1550">It’d be a complete economic catastrophe.</p>
<p t="1429800" d="5739">I said, well you know the predictions are
that if Canada separates, or Quebec separates</p>
<p t="1435539" d="3890">and no one would know how to do that, is that
the Canadian economy will collapse, and of</p>
<p t="1439429" d="4641">course, that&#39;ll collapse the Quebec economy
too, and he didn&#39;t deny that.</p>
<p t="1444070" d="2359">He said, yeah but it would be worth it.</p>
<p t="1446429" d="3771">And I thought, well there&#39;s just no way of
having a conversation under those circumstances</p>
<p t="1450200" d="5180">because from my perspective, total, you know,
severe economic collapse is a good reason</p>
<p t="1455380" d="7370">not to do something, but if you believed that
the future potential is such that that’s</p>
<p t="1462750" d="2530">justified, then well there&#39;s no arguing with
you.</p>
<p t="1465280" d="3540">It’s just something that decided, and that&#39;s
the end of that.</p>
<p t="1468820" d="4121">When I lived in Quebec, as I did for a long
time, I learned very quickly never to have</p>
<p t="1472941" d="4049">a discussion about politics with anyone who
was a separatist because it was just absolutely</p>
<p t="1476990" d="1909">counterproductive, you know.</p>
<p t="1478899" d="5851">They had axioms of belief that weren&#39;t movable,
like the future will be good enough so that</p>
<p t="1484750" d="3350">no matter what price we pay in the present,
that will be justified.</p>
<p t="1488100" d="1660">It’s like, well that&#39;s not an idea right.</p>
<p t="1489760" d="6140">It’s a statement of faith, and you saw exactly
the same thing happening, not with the same</p>
<p t="1495900" d="4350">principles, I’m not saying that, but you
saw the same thing happening from a psychological</p>
<p t="1500250" d="5680">perspective in Russia when the Communists
really started to become active in the 1920s</p>
<p t="1505930" d="5219">when any matter of horror whatsoever was fully
justifiable because it was going to bring</p>
<p t="1511149" d="5741">about some future state that was basically
equivalent to paradise.</p>
<p t="1516890" d="6539">So anyways, and then you know, Dostoevsky
pursued the idea of nihilism even farther</p>
<p t="1523429" d="3021">because Dostoevsky was certainly someone who
was willing to go to the ends of an argument,</p>
<p t="1526450" d="7120">and one of the things he proclaimed was that
if there was no god, then anything was permitted,</p>
<p t="1533570" d="6140">and his basic hypothesis was well if there&#39;s
no ultimate arbiter of values, if there&#39;s</p>
<p t="1539710" d="5260">no transcendent arbiter of values, then you&#39;re
radically free.</p>
<p t="1544970" d="4329">Now, you know, the existentialists would say
you could use that radical freedom to find</p>
<p t="1549299" d="4781">meaning in your life, but one of the things
Dostoevsky realized was that you could use</p>
<p t="1554080" d="2740">that radical freedom for anything that you
wanted.</p>
<p t="1556820" d="5940">So in his book “Crime and Punishment,”
for example, he explores the actions and beliefs</p>
<p t="1562760" d="4769">of a student who was named Raskolnikov, and
Raskolnikov is a starving student.</p>
<p t="1567529" d="4821">He’s a law student, and he doesn&#39;t have
enough to eat so of course his cognition is</p>
<p t="1572350" d="4870">a little bit on the addled side because he’s
going through periods of starvation and drunkenness,</p>
<p t="1577220" d="2390">so it’s not like he’s thinking that clearly.</p>
<p t="1579610" d="4520">He wants to become a law student so that he
can help society, and he finds out that his</p>
<p t="1584130" d="6080">sister is basically willing to enter into
a loveless marriage and more or less prostitute</p>
<p t="1590210" d="4990">herself so that she can generate enough money
to share with her mother so that they can</p>
<p t="1595200" d="5250">fund his continuation through law school,
and he thinks that wouldn&#39;t be a very good</p>
<p t="1600450" d="1000">deal.</p>
<p t="1601450" d="5260">At the same time, he’s indebted to a pawnbroker
who everyone hates, who’s an absolutely</p>
<p t="1606710" d="5430">miserable person in every possible way, and
Dostoevsky sets up the situation like that,</p>
<p t="1612140" d="5509">so the pawnbroker has a niece, if I remember
correctly who she basically enslaves and mistreats,</p>
<p t="1617649" d="4801">and she squirrels away all sorts of money
but never does anything with it, lives in</p>
<p t="1622450" d="6199">absolute poverty, and anyways, he considers
her the sort of person without whom the world</p>
<p t="1628649" d="1821">would be a better place.</p>
<p t="1630470" d="6531">So having all these things co-occurring in
his imagination, he decides that because there</p>
<p t="1637001" d="5589">are no ultimate arbiters of value, that all
morality is essentially cowardice which is</p>
<p t="1642590" d="3280">kind of the reverse of what nietzsche concluded.</p>
<p t="1645870" d="5470">He said most people were cowardly and justified
that with their morality, but Raskolnikov</p>
<p t="1651340" d="4800">took the other idea which is “Well why do
I have to obey any rules at all.</p>
<p t="1656140" d="5700">If there’s no ultimate source for all of
these rules, it’s just convention and cowardice,</p>
<p t="1661840" d="4010">and if I have enough strength then I could
leap outside of that framework and I can do</p>
<p t="1665850" d="1150">whatever I want.”</p>
<p t="1667000" d="5630">So he decides to kill the pawnbroker which
he does, and quite successfully, and not only</p>
<p t="1672630" d="4100">that, he gets away with it, and that&#39;s about
the first third of “Crime and Punishment,”</p>
<p t="1676730" d="6000">and the rest of the book is the discussion
of the manner in which he comes unglued as</p>
<p t="1682730" d="5909">a consequence of having performed this act,
and it’s a brilliant - it’s an absolutely</p>
<p t="1688639" d="7111">brilliant study of the way that a value system
holds you together even in ways that you don&#39;t</p>
<p t="1695750" d="6019">know, and then if you step outside of that
and violate your relationship to it in some</p>
<p t="1701769" d="5530">really intense way, then there&#39;s going to
be catastrophic psychological consequences</p>
<p t="1707299" d="2141">that’ll echo through your whole being.</p>
<p t="1709440" d="6500">We know that this is more than theory because
many people, soldiers in particular who develop</p>
<p t="1715940" d="4830">Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, develop Post
Traumatic Stress Disorder when they observe</p>
<p t="1720770" d="5930">themselves doing something that they regard
as tremendously cruel, or vicious, or immoral,</p>
<p t="1726700" d="7740">you know, and they&#39;re in this situation where,
you know, acting in that manner is highly</p>
<p t="1734440" d="1000">probable.</p>
<p t="1735440" d="1000">It’s a war situation.</p>
<p t="1736440" d="3729">It’s usually very intense, and you know,
they don&#39;t have a lot of time to make decisions,</p>
<p t="1740169" d="6541">and god only knows, you know, what the specifics
are of the particular event, but many, many</p>
<p t="1746710" d="6340">people come to be so shattered by observing
themselves do things they can&#39;t believe that</p>
<p t="1753050" d="4420">a human being would be capable of doing that
they never recover, and it’s partly because,</p>
<p t="1757470" d="7250">you know, that they violate their ethical
-- the ethical structure that holds them together,</p>
<p t="1764720" d="5180">holds all their ideas, and their plans, and
their perceptions, and their interactions</p>
<p t="1769900" d="1020">with other people.</p>
<p t="1770920" d="4770">That&#39;s a unifying field in some sense, and
if you violate it and it fragments, then you&#39;re</p>
<p t="1775690" d="5530">left absolutely fragmented and that&#39;s not
-- that&#39;s not even a psychological observation,</p>
<p t="1781220" d="2630">it’s a psychophysiological observation.</p>
<p t="1783850" d="5470">You can stress yourself so badly, raise your
stress levels so high that your brain starts</p>
<p t="1789320" d="6380">to become damaged by the stress hormone and,
you know, so it’s not just a psychological</p>
<p t="1795700" d="5890">state, it’s damage to the core of your being
in some sense.</p>
<p t="1801590" d="7329">Now, the collapse of these belief systems
and their destabilization was well thought</p>
<p t="1808919" d="4791">through by these thinkers by the end of the
nineteenth century, and then we have the technological</p>
<p t="1813710" d="6150">transformations, and the sociological and
political transformations of the early part</p>
<p t="1819860" d="5669">of the twentieth century that leaves everyone
in a state of confusion, in some sense, like</p>
<p t="1825529" d="1370">in Germany in the 1920’s.</p>
<p t="1826899" d="6150">Of course, the Germans had gone through this
terrible period of trench warfare, so all</p>
<p t="1833049" d="1411">their men were brutalized.</p>
<p t="1834460" d="3660">Some of them had been on the front for months,
and that was in the trenches, and then, you</p>
<p t="1838120" d="4630">know, their political system had collapsed
and they put a weakly rooted democracy in</p>
<p t="1842750" d="4159">place, and the economic system collapsed and
Germany went through a period of hyperinflation</p>
<p t="1846909" d="5421">so that the value of their money basically
dropped to zero.</p>
<p t="1852330" d="4680">So that meant if you were 65 years old, and
saved up your whole life to have enough money</p>
<p t="1857010" d="5249">to retire, and you were a good citizen, you
know, and prudent and careful, every single</p>
<p t="1862259" d="6571">thing you ever owned disappeared, and so at
the same time, you know, the Communist revolution</p>
<p t="1868830" d="4910">had taken place in Soviet Russia, and there
was great concern within Germany that the</p>
<p t="1873740" d="5169">same thing was likely to happen there, and
certainly the Communists were always pushing</p>
<p t="1878909" d="4380">for that because they had the common term,
which is the international Communist movement</p>
<p t="1883289" d="6661">which was devoted to destabilizing, you know,
non-Communist governments and producing the</p>
<p t="1889950" d="4559">preconditions for the revolution, so it wasn&#39;t
like it was just paranoia, it was a real threat,</p>
<p t="1894509" d="4681">and it was out of all that mess that came
the emergence of the fascists, and the Nazis,</p>
<p t="1899190" d="5670">and it’s not that, you know, it’s not
that surprising because chaos breeds the desire</p>
<p t="1904860" d="1779">for order.</p>
<p t="1906639" d="6390">So that was one direction that people could
go, you know, instead of following some abstract</p>
<p t="1913029" d="5240">Messiah, let’s say, the sort of idea that
was embedded in classical Christianity, they</p>
<p t="1918269" d="5441">realized a new Messiah, and that was Hitler,
and that certainly didn&#39;t seem to be any improvement,</p>
<p t="1923710" d="5880">you know, because Hitler was really a messiah
of destruction and fire, and you know, the</p>
<p t="1929590" d="3839">World War II killed about a hundred and twenty
million people, and of course, it left Germany</p>
<p t="1933429" d="4701">in absolute ruins, and Hitler killed himself
in his bunker underneath Berlin while it was</p>
<p t="1938130" d="4409">burning and the Russians were advancing into,
you know, into Germany, and they were not</p>
<p t="1942539" d="1000">happy.</p>
<p t="1943539" d="5130">You didn&#39;t want to be a German national while
the Soviets were advancing towards you after</p>
<p t="1948669" d="5470">your country had invaded theirs, pushed them
back halfway across the Soviet Union, you</p>
<p t="1954139" d="4120">know, and produced a tremendous amount of
damage and distress.</p>
<p t="1958259" d="8311">It was an awful situation, you know, and the
messiahs that the Russians turned to: Lenin,</p>
<p t="1966570" d="6050">and Stalin were barbaric and brutal beyond
comprehension, and you know it’s a strange</p>
<p t="1972620" d="6039">thing, you know, we’re not very well educated
in what happened in the Soviet Union in the</p>
<p t="1978659" d="1000">twentieth century.</p>
<p t="1979659" d="4411">We know far more about what happened in Germany,
say with the Holocaust, and you know, it’s</p>
<p t="1984070" d="4609">very important that people should know about
that, but there were tens of millions of people</p>
<p t="1988679" d="5850">brutally destroyed in the Soviet Union, and
you know, partly because they were murdered</p>
<p t="1994529" d="7301">by people who were, at least in principle,
motivated by left-wing utopian visions.</p>
<p t="2001830" d="5510">We seem to… our education system seems to
regard that as somehow more forgivable which</p>
<p t="2007340" d="2490">it certainly isn&#39;t.</p>
<p t="2009830" d="7559">So, you know, the whole generate secular alternatives
to religious belief issue didn&#39;t seem to work</p>
<p t="2017389" d="6361">out very well, and then the nihilism alternative
-- well that has its own problems, you know.</p>
<p t="2023750" d="5100">One problem is the sort that Dostoevsky talked
about, you know, and you see the kids who</p>
<p t="2028850" d="5679">go up and shoot up high schools and explode
in rage, you know.</p>
<p t="2034529" d="3760">They&#39;re often people who feel that they have
no meaning in their life, that life itself</p>
<p t="2038289" d="6620">is contemptible and that suffering is too
extreme and that they bear the brunt of unfair</p>
<p t="2044909" d="8551">reality, and you know, they develop unbelievably
dark and destructive theories of revenge and</p>
<p t="2053460" d="4270">mayhem over, sometimes over the period of
years and then they go out in the world and</p>
<p t="2057730" d="6280">lay those things out, and it’s not like
their thinking is irrational, you know.</p>
<p t="2064010" d="1000">It’s coherent.</p>
<p t="2065010" d="3930">It’s just predicated on principles that
you might not agree with, such as, you know,</p>
<p t="2068940" d="5060">the principle that “everyone I don’t like
deserves to die,” but you know, in the absence</p>
<p t="2074000" d="8079">of a really formal way of demonstrating that
such thoughts are not only immoral, but wrong,</p>
<p t="2082079" d="3830">you know, in some absolute sense, it’s very
difficult to come up with ways of defending</p>
<p t="2085909" d="3020">ourselves against those two extremes, you
know.</p>
<p t="2088929" d="5801">The extreme of destructive nihilism, and the
extremes of ideological possession.</p>
<p t="2094730" d="7200">Now, Nietzsche started to work out some solutions
to this, and I just started to touch on those</p>
<p t="2101930" d="4360">at the end of the last lecture.</p>
<p t="2106290" d="4789">You know, Dostoevsky’s solution was a return
to Christianity, fundamentally, and its revivification,</p>
<p t="2111079" d="6361">and that was the same tact that Alexander
Solzhenitsyn attempted to lay out, and also</p>
<p t="2117440" d="5951">Tolstoy in Russia, you know, and I’ll talk
to you about that a little bit more in the</p>
<p t="2123391" d="1000">next lecture.</p>
<p t="2124391" d="2589">Dostoevsky -- or Nietzsche’s idea was that
people would have to… he said, you know,</p>
<p t="2126980" d="4869">in his quote about the death of God, that
people would have to become like gods just</p>
<p t="2131849" d="7501">to be able to tolerate the consequences of
this dismemberment of the previous civilization,</p>
<p t="2139350" d="6479">and he believed, well his thinking on this,
I would say, is somewhat fragmentary.</p>
<p t="2145829" d="6811">I mean, Nietzsche was a great critic of Christianity,
institutionalized Christianity, and a great</p>
<p t="2152640" d="1000">diagnostician.</p>
<p t="2153640" d="6400">He could say what was rotten at the core of
Western civilization, we’ll say modern civilization,</p>
<p t="2160040" d="5910">but when it came to actually describing what
to do about it, well he didn&#39;t live that long,</p>
<p t="2165950" d="1000">you know.</p>
<p t="2166950" d="1000">He died a fairly young man.</p>
<p t="2167950" d="3159">There&#39;s actually a video of Nietzsche in the
mental hospital online.</p>
<p t="2171109" d="1401">I just found it the other night.</p>
<p t="2172510" d="4859">I had no idea that he was ever captured on
video, but there&#39;s video from -- movie from</p>
<p t="2177369" d="6021">about 1899 showing him in a mental hospital
where he ended up in his early forties.</p>
<p t="2183390" d="7240">So he talked about the development of the
being he called the overman, which is often</p>
<p t="2190630" d="7280">translated as superman, and his idea was that
people would have to take onto themselves</p>
<p t="2197910" d="6530">the burden of creating new systems of meaning
and new moralities that were suited to them,</p>
<p t="2204440" d="3250">that they would have to create new values.</p>
<p t="2207690" d="9730">Now, Jung took Nietzsche’s diagnosis very,
very seriously, and you can certainly say</p>
<p t="2217420" d="4730">that Jung was as much influenced by Nietzsche
as he was by Freud, and I would say in some</p>
<p t="2222150" d="4920">ways, he was influenced more because one of
the things that Jung was trying to do was</p>
<p t="2227070" d="4049">to identify where the loss values had gone.</p>
<p t="2231119" d="7171">So the Nietzschean idea is that it’s possible
for human beings to create their own values.</p>
<p t="2238290" d="5950">Now, there&#39;s a problem with that, and there&#39;s
a variety of problems with that, and one is</p>
<p t="2244240" d="7230">that it doesn&#39;t seem exactly true in that,
you know, and a lot of the existentialists</p>
<p t="2251470" d="4349">who followed Nietzsche, like Jean-Paul Sartre
for example, believed in the radical freedom</p>
<p t="2255819" d="7201">of human beings, that we were doomed to be
free, in a sense, and it was absolutely necessary</p>
<p t="2263020" d="4610">for us to conjure up our own meanings and
values because fundamentally, we face the</p>
<p t="2267630" d="5850">void and, you know, life was nasty, and brutish,
and short, to use Hobbes’s terms, and that</p>
<p t="2273480" d="6730">we had to be able to confront that and live
despite it, and well, there&#39;s a variety of</p>
<p t="2280210" d="1850">problems with that solution.</p>
<p t="2282060" d="4039">The first one is, well, if you come up with
your systems of values, there&#39;s no reason</p>
<p t="2286099" d="5031">-- and I come up with mine, there’s no reason
to assume that they&#39;re going to be sufficiently</p>
<p t="2291130" d="3910">integrable so that we don&#39;t have to fight
each other to the death.</p>
<p t="2295040" d="1000">That&#39;s a big problem.</p>
<p t="2296040" d="3780">So, you know, you have every single person
with their own system of beliefs.</p>
<p t="2299820" d="6490">Well, fine, except how do -- in a sense, that&#39;s
a structured, kind of philosophical anarchy.</p>
<p t="2306310" d="4420">Well, okay, maybe that&#39;s good if you happen
to live alone on an island, but if you&#39;re</p>
<p t="2310730" d="4810">stuck with all these other people, then that
becomes a very difficult thing to manage,</p>
<p t="2315540" d="5319">and I think it’s partly for that reason
that Sartre famously said, “Hell is other</p>
<p t="2320859" d="5381">people,” you know, because he thought of
the other, in some sense, that which was not</p>
<p t="2326240" d="5180">him, as a suppressive force that stopped him
from manifesting his destiny in the way that</p>
<p t="2331420" d="2550">would have been best for him.</p>
<p t="2333970" d="5610">Well, you know, hell might be other people,
but that doesn&#39;t mean that -- first of all</p>
<p t="2339580" d="4200">that&#39;s a very one-sided way of looking at
things because, of course, hell is other people.</p>
<p t="2343780" d="3180">Hell is you too, and you know, hell is nature.</p>
<p t="2346960" d="4869">There&#39;s lots of places that you can find hell,
but by the same token, you know, the most</p>
<p t="2351829" d="4841">meaningful elements of people’s lives are
often in their social relationships, and you</p>
<p t="2356670" d="4710">can&#39;t lay everything at the door of pathological
society, you know, and we shouldn&#39;t forget</p>
<p t="2361380" d="3780">as well that Sartre didn’t…</p>
<p t="2365160" d="6149">what -- come up with any reasonable critique
of the Communists until the late 1960s, and</p>
<p t="2371309" d="1760">you know, that was a little late.</p>
<p t="2373069" d="5250">People with any sense, like George Orwell,
had figured out that the whole Soviet experiment</p>
<p t="2378319" d="8011">had become radically murderous by the early
1940s, and so Sartre, you know, proposed radical</p>
<p t="2386330" d="8350">freedom as a… as the existential response
to the unveiling of no meaning, but when it</p>
<p t="2394680" d="4899">came right down to it, he couldn&#39;t resist
identification with a totalitarian structure,</p>
<p t="2399579" d="5010">so I don&#39;t see any reason why we should really
pay any attention to what he had to say.</p>
<p t="2404589" d="4211">So… and now there&#39;s another problem with
the idea that people should create their own</p>
<p t="2408800" d="6019">values, and that is that it’s not so simple,
you know, and the problem seemed to be that</p>
<p t="2414819" d="2540">you don&#39;t obey yourself very well.</p>
<p t="2417359" d="2391">You know, you can say, “Well here’s my
code.</p>
<p t="2419750" d="1410">I’m going to live by it.”</p>
<p t="2421160" d="2530">So, and let’s do that simply to begin with.</p>
<p t="2423690" d="5270">You say, “Well I’m going to study very
hard and do well at my classes,” just for</p>
<p t="2428960" d="3560">the sake of argument, you know, but you don&#39;t,
you know.</p>
<p t="2432520" d="3569">You procrastinate, and you have a paper you&#39;re
supposed to read, and you know you&#39;re supposed</p>
<p t="2436089" d="4471">to read it, and you need to read it for reasons
that are hypothetically important to you,</p>
<p t="2440560" d="3380">but there&#39;s no damn way you can get yourself
to sit down and read it.</p>
<p t="2443940" d="4830">Your attention wanders, and you go to do three
or four stupid things, and you feel terrible</p>
<p t="2448770" d="4530">about it, like you feel like you&#39;re betraying
yourself, and maybe this is a continual pattern</p>
<p t="2453300" d="4370">in your life, but one of the things you find
out is that you don&#39;t get to create your own</p>
<p t="2457670" d="5120">damn values because, for some reason, you&#39;re
not in charge of yourself, and of course that&#39;s</p>
<p t="2462790" d="4110">where the psychoanalytic idea started to come
from, you know, Freud notices -- this is in</p>
<p t="2466900" d="4980">the aftermath of Nietzsche -- that you&#39;re
not the master of your own psyche, you know,</p>
<p t="2471880" d="6050">that there&#39;s many sub-yous inside of you and
that they don&#39;t all want the same thing, and</p>
<p t="2477930" d="6290">so the idea that you can generate your own
meaning is very -- it’s an insufficiently</p>
<p t="2484220" d="9210">developed idea because there&#39;s a lot of meaning-making
generators residing within you, and not only</p>
<p t="2493430" d="4899">do they not all point in the same direction
which is a huge problem, but they don&#39;t even</p>
<p t="2498329" d="4980">necessarily -- they don&#39;t necessarily lay
themselves out in some integrated fashion</p>
<p t="2503309" d="5191">across time, and they don&#39;t necessarily operate
together in a way that&#39;s going to enable you</p>
<p t="2508500" d="3560">to find your place with other people and in
society.</p>
<p t="2512060" d="2799">So, you know, make your own meaning.</p>
<p t="2514859" d="1971">Well, which part of you, you know?</p>
<p t="2516830" d="1970">You&#39;re not a unified thing.</p>
<p t="2518800" d="5519">So that&#39;s a big problem, and then well these
other problems just remain unaddressed completely.</p>
<p t="2524319" d="5631">Well, one answer to that, and this is the
answer that the more radical existentialists</p>
<p t="2529950" d="4919">took is that well, society has to be reconfigured,
but you know, we kind of know where that leads</p>
<p t="2534869" d="1000">too.</p>
<p t="2535869" d="5531">When people are doing radical societal reconfiguration,
at least as far as we’ve been able to tell,</p>
<p t="2541400" d="4340">most of the time that&#39;s an absolute, murderous,
catastrophe.</p>
<p t="2545740" d="5349">So, you know, it’s reasonable -- it seems
reasonable to me to presume that those experiments</p>
<p t="2551089" d="2381">have already been run.</p>
<p t="2553470" d="8920">Alright so, now Jung, like Dostoevsky, was
very interested in returning to sources of</p>
<p t="2562390" d="6090">meaning from which he believed that our original
religious ideas had emerged, and this is partly</p>
<p t="2568480" d="2250">his notion of the collective unconscious.</p>
<p t="2570730" d="6470">So, you know, part of the radical critique
of religious systems is predicated on the</p>
<p t="2577200" d="5740">idea that there&#39;s something like conscious
beliefs, you know, there are articulated beliefs</p>
<p t="2582940" d="3730">that you could lay out in a credo, but that&#39;s
not right.</p>
<p t="2586670" d="3871">It doesn&#39;t seem to be correct at all, and
Nietzsche actually knew this, you know.</p>
<p t="2590541" d="4419">He knew that a lot of our social institutions
had emerged from the bottom up and had only</p>
<p t="2594960" d="5300">become articulated after they had been embodied
and danced out essentially, you know.</p>
<p t="2600260" d="5760">You -- a tribal group learns how to organize
itself over thousands and thousands of years</p>
<p t="2606020" d="4339">of trial and error and pushing against each
other, and so forth, and they come into that</p>
<p t="2610359" d="6611">tribal grouping with a biological substrate,
and their sociological and political interactions</p>
<p t="2616970" d="4410">are constrained by all of those things, and
then maybe they come up with a description</p>
<p t="2621380" d="5120">of that, over time, a self-description, and
an articulated representation, and that&#39;s</p>
<p t="2626500" d="1440">the religious system.</p>
<p t="2627940" d="6340">It’s not that the religious system is thought
out first, as a system of metaphysical presuppositions,</p>
<p t="2634280" d="6140">images, and dreams, then turned into rules,
then imposed on the population who then obeys</p>
<p t="2640420" d="7699">it, and generally speaking, when people criticize
formal religion, they criticized it assuming</p>
<p t="2648119" d="3940">that that&#39;s how it developed, you know, and
that&#39;s kind of a Marxist idea, for example,</p>
<p t="2652059" d="4681">that religion is the opiate of the masses,
and that you know, the religious structures</p>
<p t="2656740" d="3859">were laid out so that a small elite could
control the population.</p>
<p t="2660599" d="7901">Now, you know, in virtually every domain,
a small elite emerges that dominates the population.</p>
<p t="2668500" d="1720">I don&#39;t care what domain you look at.</p>
<p t="2670220" d="7360">So Marx is accurate in that way, in that,
you know, there&#39;s always a power imbalance</p>
<p t="2677580" d="8370">between elite minority and a non-elite majority,
but to say that that&#39;s the cause of all the</p>
<p t="2685950" d="7230">systems that people interact within is, well
it’s unsophisticated beyond belief.</p>
<p t="2693180" d="4460">What it does is that it takes phenomena that
are complex beyond comprehension and reduce</p>
<p t="2697640" d="1000">them to one thing.</p>
<p t="2698640" d="6770">It’s not helpful, like you know, here’s
an example.</p>
<p t="2705410" d="7699">If you sampled popular songs on YouTube, let’s
say you made a graph of how popular songs</p>
<p t="2713109" d="1031">were.</p>
<p t="2714140" d="7870">What you find is that about ten songs, at
any given time, are played -- half of all</p>
<p t="2722010" d="4589">the songs played at any given time are going
to be one of ten songs.</p>
<p t="2726599" d="4321">Well, and then what the other thing you’d
find is that half of all songs played are</p>
<p t="2730920" d="6340">played by one or more of ten musicians, and
that&#39;s true no matter if you look all the</p>
<p t="2737260" d="4630">from the 1930s to now, if you look at popular
music, you see the same thing.</p>
<p t="2741890" d="5669">Almost everything that almost everyone listens
to is created by very few people, and then</p>
<p t="2747559" d="4741">there&#39;s millions of musicians, but you&#39;ve
never heard of most of them and you&#39;ll never</p>
<p t="2752300" d="1660">hear a song from most of them.</p>
<p t="2753960" d="5129">It’s a small minority, and what you see
is in any field of creative production, this</p>
<p t="2759089" d="1000">happens.</p>
<p t="2760089" d="4661">A small elite emerges, and dominates the entire
landscape.</p>
<p t="2764750" d="7190">Now, you know, it would be kind of ridiculous
to assume that the ten most popular singers</p>
<p t="2771940" d="4600">and musicians that are currently operative
were those who gave rise to the system that</p>
<p t="2776540" d="1390">allowed them to thrive.</p>
<p t="2777930" d="6490">I mean, obviously that&#39;s a dopey idea, and
it’s no more an intelligent idea when you</p>
<p t="2784420" d="5500">look at any other domain where there&#39;s tremendous
variation, and the emergence of an elite.</p>
<p t="2789920" d="2130">It’s a very common phenomena.</p>
<p t="2792050" d="4069">It happens, as I said, it happens anywhere
there&#39;s creative production, and so that&#39;s</p>
<p t="2796119" d="3651">why one percent of the people, you know, roughly
have fifty percent of the money.</p>
<p t="2799770" d="3700">It’s no different in other creative domains.</p>
<p t="2803470" d="5050">Now, we’ll talk later in the course about
why that happens, but to think it’s because</p>
<p t="2808520" d="5750">those people set up the system so that they
could thrive is -- well there’s an element</p>
<p t="2814270" d="5760">of that, obviously, because once you&#39;re rich,
you&#39;re going to prefer political policies</p>
<p t="2820030" d="4370">that help you stay rich, but that doesn&#39;t
mean you set up the whole damn system that</p>
<p t="2824400" d="5480">made you rich to begin with, plus it’s not
the same people over any reasonable span of</p>
<p t="2829880" d="1000">time.</p>
<p t="2830880" d="4070">So, the one percent of people who have most
of the money, it’s always one percent, but</p>
<p t="2834950" d="2770">it’s not the same people, you know.</p>
<p t="2837720" d="4639">Each individuals tend to hold on to money
for very short periods of time, and big companies</p>
<p t="2842359" d="1931">don&#39;t last very long, you know.</p>
<p t="2844290" d="4880">They last on average about 30, 35, 40 years,
and that&#39;s it, then they disappear.</p>
<p t="2849170" d="4810">So, and it’s because, you know, the economic
landscape is just churning like mad.</p>
<p t="2853980" d="5690">It’s very difficult for a company to -- you
know, there&#39;s not that many big steam coach</p>
<p t="2859670" d="6710">companies anymore, you know, and nobody make
zeppelins, and nobody makes typewriters.</p>
<p t="2866380" d="3660">You know what I mean, it’s things move quick,
and just because you dominated the landscape</p>
<p t="2870040" d="5049">at one particular moment doesn&#39;t mean you&#39;re
going to be able to do it at the next.</p>
<p t="2875089" d="4770">Alright, so the create your own meaning thing
is a rough one, and then there&#39;s another problem</p>
<p t="2879859" d="4440">too which is “What makes you think you have
enough time?”</p>
<p t="2884299" d="5591">You know, lots of times people come to me
and they have relationship problems, and part</p>
<p t="2889890" d="6250">of the problem is that they&#39;ve set their relationships
up outside of social norms, and they do that,</p>
<p t="2896140" d="4240">so they&#39;ll say something to me like well we’re
not going to get married because marriage</p>
<p t="2900380" d="4459">is just a piece of paper, which is really
a stupid thing to say, like it’s an incredibly</p>
<p t="2904839" d="5171">stupid thing to say, but underneath that,
there&#39;s this idea that they want to remain</p>
<p t="2910010" d="4260">free of social constraints so that they can
negotiate their own way, like if you&#39;re giving</p>
<p t="2914270" d="4049">them credit, for you know, wanting freedom
instead of just escaping responsibility, but</p>
<p t="2918319" d="3431">the problem with that is, it’s like okay,
good luck.</p>
<p t="2921750" d="1570">Try it.</p>
<p t="2923320" d="4960">I don&#39;t know why you would assume that you
have enough time in the thirty or forty years</p>
<p t="2928280" d="4990">that you&#39;re going to be pursuing relationships
to actually figure out how they should run.</p>
<p t="2933270" d="4870">You don&#39;t have a hope of that, and it’s
worse too because very, very few people can</p>
<p t="2938140" d="5330">negotiate, you know, because here&#39;s the way
it works.</p>
<p t="2943470" d="5050">You either adhere to the social order, or
you stand outside it.</p>
<p t="2948520" d="4789">As soon as you stand outside of it, you&#39;re
in a chaotic place because there&#39;s no guidelines,</p>
<p t="2953309" d="5991">and then you either live chaotically because
there&#39;s no guidelines or you start to formulate</p>
<p t="2959300" d="6860">order, but to do that, you have to know what
you want, and you have to know how to express</p>
<p t="2966160" d="5419">it, and then you have to figure out what your
partner wants, and then help them express</p>
<p t="2971579" d="3161">it and then you have to negotiate a solution.</p>
<p t="2974740" d="4930">Well, I would say one in twenty people know
how to negotiate.</p>
<p t="2979670" d="1380">It’s really, really difficult.</p>
<p t="2981050" d="2180">I mean, just think of the steps.</p>
<p t="2983230" d="3360">First of all, you have to know what you want,
and then you have to admit it to yourself.</p>
<p t="2986590" d="5570">Well, yeah right, like you&#39;re not even gonna
get to the first one in all likelihood.</p>
<p t="2992160" d="1090">What do you want?</p>
<p t="2993250" d="3339">A lot of what you want can&#39;t be articulated
even, you know.</p>
<p t="2996589" d="2401">I’ll give you an example.</p>
<p t="2998990" d="7670">So, there&#39;s a great study done awhile back
on prediction of relationship longevity.</p>
<p t="3006660" d="3660">Okay, so here was the question.</p>
<p t="3010320" d="6410">“How many negative interactions do you have
to have, per set of positive” -- sorry.</p>
<p t="3016730" d="4260">“How many positive interactions, per negative
interaction, do you have to have with your</p>
<p t="3020990" d="4030">partner in order for the relationship to remain
stable?”</p>
<p t="3025020" d="5560">Okay, so let&#39;s say you have one negative interaction
to every one positive interaction.</p>
<p t="3030580" d="4410">Okay, or maybe you have ten negatives to every
positive, then you can imagine a different</p>
<p t="3034990" d="4319">situation where you have a hundred positives
to one negative, right, spanning the whole</p>
<p t="3039309" d="5240">potential continuum, and you use that to predict
relationship satisfaction and longevity.</p>
<p t="3044549" d="5941">Well, you might think, well god obviously,
a hundred positive to one negative is where</p>
<p t="3050490" d="5290">the preferable ratio and so it’s those people
who, you know, their relationship is nothing</p>
<p t="3055780" d="3000">but constant compliments and bliss.</p>
<p t="3058780" d="1000">They&#39;re the ones who last.</p>
<p t="3059780" d="2039">It’s not true.</p>
<p t="3061819" d="6980">What you see is that there&#39;s an optimal…
an optimal ratio domain.</p>
<p t="3068799" d="5750">If it falls below five to one positive to
negative, then your relationship falls apart.</p>
<p t="3074549" d="4771">It’s too negative, and it’s partly because
people feel negative emotion more than they</p>
<p t="3079320" d="6090">feel positive emotion because you can be hurt
more than you can be pleased, and so one that&#39;s</p>
<p t="3085410" d="5410">only five to one is too punishing, and people
won&#39;t stay in it, but if you get above to</p>
<p t="3090820" d="6380">eleven to one, it gets not punishing enough,
and then you think well what does that mean</p>
<p t="3097200" d="1000">exactly?</p>
<p t="3098200" d="1970">Well, what do you want in a relationship?</p>
<p t="3100170" d="1710">Well you think, bliss.</p>
<p t="3101880" d="2870">It’s like, that isn&#39;t what you want, as
it turns out.</p>
<p t="3104750" d="2990">It’s more like you want someone to contend
with, you know.</p>
<p t="3107740" d="1510">You don&#39;t want a pushover.</p>
<p t="3109250" d="5761">You don&#39;t want everything just to be easy,
you know, and this is the sort of… the sort</p>
<p t="3115011" d="3308">of phenomena that Kierkegaard was talking
about when he talked about deciding to make</p>
<p t="3118319" d="3341">things more difficult for people because that&#39;s
what they need.</p>
<p t="3121660" d="4390">You know, you know this perfectly well because
if you go outside with someone and they worship</p>
<p t="3126050" d="4350">you, and they dolt on your every word, and
there&#39;s nothing but positive feedback coming</p>
<p t="3130400" d="4000">from them, you lose respect for them almost
instantly, and you go wander off and find</p>
<p t="3134400" d="5090">someone whos more interesting, and part of
the reason for that, I think, is that you</p>
<p t="3139490" d="5570">want the person that you&#39;re with to challenge
you so that not only do you do reasonably</p>
<p t="3145060" d="5559">well day to day together, you know, so that
you can co-exist in the same space with a</p>
<p t="3150619" d="4611">reasonable amount of peace, but you also want
there to be enough tension in the relationship</p>
<p t="3155230" d="4250">so that you&#39;re both involved in a process
of mutual transformation.</p>
<p t="3159480" d="4160">Well, try specifying that in an articulated
way, you know.</p>
<p t="3163640" d="1199">Good luck.</p>
<p t="3164839" d="4221">You know, and it also explains strange things
about people like the fact that they&#39;ll stay</p>
<p t="3169060" d="4480">in pretty negative relationships, like what
the hell are you doing there?</p>
<p t="3173540" d="4019">If you’d articulated it two years ago, and
you said, “Well I want to be with someone</p>
<p t="3177559" d="4290">I’m miserable with half the time,” of
course, you&#39;re never going to say that, but</p>
<p t="3181849" d="3131">it could easily be that that&#39;s what you&#39;re
after.</p>
<p t="3184980" d="11389">So well...so alright now, Heidegger is another
philosopher who was attempting in some sense</p>
<p t="3196369" d="4281">to solve the problems that were laid out by
Nietzsche and Dostoevsky, and the way that</p>
<p t="3200650" d="9500">Heidegger began to resolve them was by taking
a radically new look at philosophy itself,</p>
<p t="3210150" d="8250">and he was one of the prime phenomenologists,
and I told you awhile back that the phenomenologists</p>
<p t="3218400" d="7020">decided to reconstitute Western philosophy
so that it was focusing on being instead of</p>
<p t="3225420" d="4939">knowledge, and so the hardest thing to grasp
about the phenomenologists is what exactly</p>
<p t="3230359" d="3911">they meant by being, and -- so I’ll give
you a…</p>
<p t="3234270" d="2360">I’ll give you an overview of that.</p>
<p t="3236630" d="3699">So that&#39;s where the term “da sein” comes
from, and that&#39;s a German term, and it means</p>
<p t="3240329" d="1000">“being there.”</p>
<p t="3241329" d="5641">So right now, you&#39;re encapsulated in a da
sein, and the da sein is the totality of your</p>
<p t="3246970" d="7850">experience, and that experience would be an
experience of an extended world, the natural</p>
<p t="3254820" d="6850">world, and then the social world, and then
inside that, the world of your subjective</p>
<p t="3261670" d="6260">experience, and that constitutes being, and
the phenomenologists make the case -- they&#39;re</p>
<p t="3267930" d="4740">not playing the subject-object game, they&#39;re
standing outside the division between subject</p>
<p t="3272670" d="3100">and object that&#39;s part of the scientific worldview.</p>
<p t="3275770" d="5510">So it’s a real paradigm shift in that you
can&#39;t use the rules from the old way of looking</p>
<p t="3281280" d="2630">at things inside the new way of looking at
things.</p>
<p t="3283910" d="2620">You have to start with new presuppositions.</p>
<p t="3286530" d="5610">So we might say, well, one of the things that
you&#39;re going to do if you look at things phenomenologically</p>
<p t="3292140" d="4360">is to assume that everything that you experience
is real.</p>
<p t="3296500" d="7170">So then, we would say that there&#39;s no attempt,
in a phenomenological world, to reduce pain</p>
<p t="3303670" d="1590">to something material.</p>
<p t="3305260" d="3890">Pain stands as -- stands itself as a phenomena.</p>
<p t="3309150" d="1540">So does anxiety.</p>
<p t="3310690" d="1310">So does joy.</p>
<p t="3312000" d="7530">All the things that the scientists of consciousness
call qualia, which are viewed by them as qualities</p>
<p t="3319530" d="3519">of the objective world, aren&#39;t viewed that
way by the phenomenologists.</p>
<p t="3323049" d="4201">They just say those are primary elements of
being.</p>
<p t="3327250" d="3890">So -- and it’s a very interesting way of
looking at things because it kind of allows</p>
<p t="3331140" d="3280">you to reclaim the validity of your own experience.</p>
<p t="3334420" d="3090">You can no longer say, “well that only subjective.”</p>
<p t="3337510" d="7529">Now that doesn&#39;t mean that everything you
claim subjectively is true, objectively or</p>
<p t="3345039" d="1020">for other people.</p>
<p t="3346059" d="5661">What it does mean is that everything that
you experience subjectively is real.</p>
<p t="3351720" d="4160">Now that doesn&#39;t mean you have to not think
about it or take it apart or categorize it</p>
<p t="3355880" d="7419">properly, you still have to do all of those
things, but you&#39;re put into a place where</p>
<p t="3363299" d="4790">there&#39;s no need to deny the reality of your
own experience, or to subordinate it to something</p>
<p t="3368089" d="1000">else.</p>
<p t="3369089" d="7211">So, for example, if I’m doing dream analysis
with someone, which I do often, if people</p>
<p t="3376300" d="7080">dream, because dreams, as Jung pointed out,
are… they&#39;re manifestations of being.</p>
<p t="3383380" d="1400">You don&#39;t come up with them.</p>
<p t="3384780" d="1200">They appear to you.</p>
<p t="3385980" d="2950">They sort of appear out of nowhere, in some
sense.</p>
<p t="3388930" d="1919">They manifest themselves.</p>
<p t="3390849" d="5940">They do it strangely, and I think the reason
for that is that they contain unarticulated</p>
<p t="3396789" d="6361">thought, but if you can get a handle on them
and assess them, then sometimes they can tell</p>
<p t="3403150" d="3620">you things that there&#39;s no other way you can
figure out, and what&#39;s really cool about them</p>
<p t="3406770" d="10370">is that they&#39;re -- they have the same personality
as phenomena in the, like the broader world</p>
<p t="3417140" d="1560">of experience have, you know.</p>
<p t="3418700" d="2760">You don&#39;t ever think about the truth of a
chair.</p>
<p t="3421460" d="2970">It’s just there, and dreams are like that.</p>
<p t="3424430" d="5399">They&#39;re just there, and if you can untangle
what they have to -- what they indicate, then</p>
<p t="3429829" d="12010">you can get a take on your own experience
that&#39;s not altered by any of your local subjective</p>
<p t="3441839" d="1000">wishes and desires.</p>
<p t="3442839" d="5341">I hate to use the word subjective in this
sort of context.</p>
<p t="3448180" d="3260">So, phenomenology is the study of being.</p>
<p t="3451440" d="5659">Now, and -- in being, there are variety of
aspects, and so one aspect -- I’ve never</p>
<p t="3457099" d="5091">remembered the names of these, but I’ll
get it here right away.</p>
<p t="3462190" d="1000">Oh yes.</p>
<p t="3463190" d="4190">Heidegger broke the world of experience, being,
into three basic categories.</p>
<p t="3467380" d="6750">There was the umwelt, which I think is basically
the world beyond culture and the individual.</p>
<p t="3474130" d="5050">There&#39;s the mitwelt, and that&#39;s the world
that we share with everyone else, so that&#39;s</p>
<p t="3479180" d="4639">roughly the social world and the social structures,
and then there&#39;s the eigenwelt which is that</p>
<p t="3483819" d="4641">domain of experience that&#39;s unique to you,
that other people can&#39;t partake in.</p>
<p t="3488460" d="6839">So those are the elements of being, as far
as the phenomenologists were concerned, and</p>
<p t="3495299" d="5800">in those domains of being, different experiences
manifest themselves.</p>
<p t="3501099" d="9181">We talked about some of the ones that would
be manifestations of the eigenwelt.</p>
<p t="3510280" d="3380">Scientists would call those things emotional
or motivational states.</p>
<p t="3513660" d="2340">Normally, people think of them as feelings.</p>
<p t="3516000" d="2240">I would say, “I feel thus.</p>
<p t="3518240" d="7089">I feel such and such,” and those are experiences
that manifest themselves to you or that you</p>
<p t="3525329" d="6641">have, depending on how you look at it, that
are indicative of the manner in which you</p>
<p t="3531970" d="2950">act in relationship to being.</p>
<p t="3534920" d="6429">Now, one of -- part of the reason that this
is relevant to psychotherapy in particular</p>
<p t="3541349" d="7251">is because the phenomenologists were very
interested in the manifestation of meaning.</p>
<p t="3548600" d="7850">So you could say, well, nihilism is the absence
of meaning, and totalitarianism is the fixedness</p>
<p t="3556450" d="5200">of meaning, right, if you&#39;re a totalitarian,
what you do is say, “All meanings exist</p>
<p t="3561650" d="1889">in relationship to this structure.”</p>
<p t="3563539" d="6091">It’s almost as if -- the phenomenologists
would say you&#39;re trying to reduce the umwelt,</p>
<p t="3569630" d="6090">which is the natural world, the mitwelt, which
is the social world, and the eigenwelt, which</p>
<p t="3575720" d="4930">is your own world, you&#39;re trying to reduce
all of that to the mitwelt so that everything</p>
<p t="3580650" d="6350">falls under an explanation that&#39;s granted
to you by some higher authority, and then</p>
<p t="3587000" d="3210">of course, the nihilists are having none of
that.</p>
<p t="3590210" d="8480">They see -- they use their eigenwelt, I would
say, their own world to invalidate meaning</p>
<p t="3598690" d="2220">in any domain.</p>
<p t="3600910" d="6709">Now the phenomenologists would say, well it’s
a mistake to use your rationality to undermine</p>
<p t="3607619" d="5021">the sense, the manifestation of meaning, and
I can give you an example of that.</p>
<p t="3612640" d="5229">So let’s say you&#39;re a good nihilist, and
you think maybe you&#39;re going to go do something</p>
<p t="3617869" d="5710">difficult like put yourself through university,
and then you think in a relatively depressed</p>
<p t="3623579" d="5121">state of mind, maybe you encounter some obstacles
of one form or another, and you think, “Oh</p>
<p t="3628700" d="1300">to hell with this.</p>
<p t="3630000" d="2180">Who’s -- What difference does it make anyways?</p>
<p t="3632180" d="2380">Who cares if I go and get my degree, you know.</p>
<p t="3634560" d="3860">None of this knowledge is particularly relevant
or meaningful and who the hell’s gonna know</p>
<p t="3638420" d="1810">the difference in a million years?”</p>
<p t="3640230" d="7150">And so you think, well that&#39;s a perfectly
rational dismissal because who is gonna know</p>
<p t="3647380" d="4780">in a million years or let’s say, well even
if you can make case that someone might know,</p>
<p t="3652160" d="4370">there might be some effects left of you in
a million years, then we’ll just multiply</p>
<p t="3656530" d="2779">it by a hundred thousand and go to a trillion
years.</p>
<p t="3659309" d="4661">So here you are, you&#39;re this little tiny speck
on a slightly bigger speck in the middle of</p>
<p t="3663970" d="5220">a galaxy that has god only knows how many
billion stars, and then there&#39;s a billion</p>
<p t="3669190" d="3950">of those galaxies, although there&#39;s way more
than that, and they&#39;re spread across this</p>
<p t="3673140" d="6010">tremendous expanse of time, and in the face
of all that, who cares what you do?</p>
<p t="3679150" d="9020">Well, what a phenomenologist would say is,
okay, let’s look at how meaning manifests</p>
<p t="3688170" d="9810">itself when you alter your own private world
in a variety of manners.</p>
<p t="3697980" d="4900">So let’s say, you&#39;re trying to do something
-- maybe you&#39;re working in a -- maybe you&#39;re</p>
<p t="3702880" d="3840">working as a volunteer in a hospital helping
sick kids, you know.</p>
<p t="3706720" d="5619">You&#39;re reading to them so that they&#39;re distracted
from their pain, and you say well, in a trillion</p>
<p t="3712339" d="3760">years, who’s gonna know the difference and
so you think, well it’s meaningless to do</p>
<p t="3716099" d="5331">this, and the phenomenologists would say,
if the frame of reference that you&#39;re using,</p>
<p t="3721430" d="7810">like if you&#39;re imposing -- if you&#39;re transforming
the way your being manifests itself so that</p>
<p t="3729240" d="7109">it becomes meaningless and absurd, then you
should try experiencing it in a different</p>
<p t="3736349" d="1000">manner.</p>
<p t="3737349" d="5082">So, it’s a -- see, because a rationalist
in some sense, the phenomenologists would</p>
<p t="3742431" d="4769">say, a rationalist can&#39;t deal with the argument
“What difference is it going to make in</p>
<p t="3747200" d="3680">a trillion years, and here you are, a little
dust speck among all these other dust specks.</p>
<p t="3750880" d="9219">It’s ultimately meaningless.”A phenomenologist
would say, “Maximize the meaning.</p>
<p t="3760099" d="1240">That&#39;s the marker of truth.”</p>
<p t="3761339" d="3691">It’s a completely different way of thinking
about it.</p>
<p t="3765030" d="5170">So he would say, for example, that if you&#39;re
going to a hospital and you&#39;re reading to</p>
<p t="3770200" d="5020">sick children, that the frame of reference
that you should use, the way that you allow</p>
<p t="3775220" d="6800">that experience to manifest itself, should
be such that the experience manifests itself</p>
<p t="3782020" d="4779">so that it’s as meaningful as possible rather
than as meaningless.</p>
<p t="3786799" d="10441">The idea being that just because you can twist
your own experience so that certain elements</p>
<p t="3797240" d="5660">of your being become meaningless does not
mean that that’s right.</p>
<p t="3802900" d="5149">The fact that it becomes meaningless actually
means that it’s wrong because you think,</p>
<p t="3808049" d="6711">you see, it all depends on what you allow
to be primary, and this is the phenomenologist</p>
<p t="3814760" d="1000">point.</p>
<p t="3815760" d="5130">If you allow your strict rationality to be
primary, then if it can attack something and</p>
<p t="3820890" d="4690">destroy it, then that thing is worthy of being
attacked and destroyed.</p>
<p t="3825580" d="6450">But if you flip it around and say, well what
you should be doing is allowing -- is interacting</p>
<p t="3832030" d="5510">with your experience or allowing your experience
to manifest itself in a manner that situates</p>
<p t="3837540" d="7559">you most meaningfully in the here and now,
whatever framework you&#39;re using to do that</p>
<p t="3845099" d="1351">that works is right.</p>
<p t="3846450" d="4109">Well it’s a completely different way of
looking at things and it’s a real -- it’s</p>
<p t="3850559" d="7540">a real escape from the pathology of rationalism,
you know, because it isn&#39;t obvious that what</p>
<p t="3858099" d="2470">you think should take priority.</p>
<p t="3860569" d="2861">Now, the phenomenologists would go farther
than that.</p>
<p t="3863430" d="13609">They would say that -- and this is something…
so here&#39;s a way of thinking about it.</p>
<p t="3877039" d="5281">So Binswanger said, “What we perceive are
first and foremost” -- Binswanger was a</p>
<p t="3882320" d="4019">psychiatrist who was very much influenced
-- Binswanger and Boss are the people we’re</p>
<p t="3886339" d="3520">going to talk about mostly -- were very much
influenced by Heideggerian ideas.</p>
<p t="3889859" d="6031">They say, “What we perceive are first and
foremost not impressions of taste, tone, smell,</p>
<p t="3895890" d="4600">or touch, not even things or objects, but
meanings.”</p>
<p t="3900490" d="5619">Okay, so the idea for the phenomenologists
is that what being is made out of is meaning.</p>
<p t="3906109" d="4651">It isn&#39;t that the objective world is made
out of things, it’s that being is made out</p>
<p t="3910760" d="1000">of meaning.</p>
<p t="3911760" d="3359">Now some of those meanings can be positive,
and some of them can be negative, and some</p>
<p t="3915119" d="4861">of them can be neutral, but the fundamental
constituent elements of being -- the fundamental</p>
<p t="3919980" d="5790">constituent element of being is meaning, and
then there is an argument between Binswanger</p>
<p t="3925770" d="2730">and Boss about how that meaning manifests
itself.</p>
<p t="3928500" d="4210">So Binswanger would say that, “You endow
meaning on the world.”</p>
<p t="3932710" d="4460">So that&#39;s kind of a Nietzschean idea, that
you create your own values so that you have</p>
<p t="3937170" d="4890">within you something that he called an a priori
ontological structure.</p>
<p t="3942060" d="4860">It’s a world designer, a matrix of meaning,
that determines how the world manifests itself</p>
<p t="3946920" d="1000">to you.</p>
<p t="3947920" d="4800">Now, the easiest way to think about that is
that, you know, you&#39;re thrown into a particular</p>
<p t="3952720" d="4830">time and place -- that&#39;s another existential
idea and that&#39;s part of the absurdity of your</p>
<p t="3957550" d="4510">life, is that you&#39;re here, now, in this particular
context and situation.</p>
<p t="3962060" d="3309">It’s something you have to contend with,
and that&#39;s true for everyone.</p>
<p t="3965369" d="4750">There are arbitrary preconditions to everyone’s
being, and one of those arbitrary preconditions</p>
<p t="3970119" d="5351">is the structure through which you look at
the world, and that structure enables some</p>
<p t="3975470" d="5780">things to be highlights and some things to
be ignored, and so, the way that meaning manifests</p>
<p t="3981250" d="6480">itself is a reflection of this a priori ontological
structure, the a priori mode of being.</p>
<p t="3987730" d="6010">So, there can&#39;t be being, which is to say
your experience, for the sake of argument,</p>
<p t="3993740" d="7271">without the structure that consists of -- that
you consist of, and so that&#39;s a given, and</p>
<p t="4001011" d="4338">it’s the action of that structure that determines
the meaning of things.</p>
<p t="4005349" d="3141">Now, Boss would say exactly the opposite.</p>
<p t="4008490" d="4099">He would say, that&#39;s the wrong way of looking
at it.</p>
<p t="4012589" d="6661">You should look at the totality of your existence,
which is partly the broad natural world, the</p>
<p t="4019250" d="4369">cultural world, and your own world, and you
should note that meaning arises in different</p>
<p t="4023619" d="2281">places of its own accord.</p>
<p t="4025900" d="7090">You can&#39;t -- you can&#39;t reduce it to the action,
say, of this ontological a priori, ontological</p>
<p t="4032990" d="5640">structure, and so one example would be, well
what about the meaning of things you don&#39;t</p>
<p t="4038630" d="1000">understand?</p>
<p t="4039630" d="5520">Well it’s hard to understand how the meaning
of things you don&#39;t understand can be attributed</p>
<p t="4045150" d="1990">to what you understand.</p>
<p t="4047140" d="2469">The meaning seems to be there, to begin with.</p>
<p t="4049609" d="2351">So here&#39;s an example.</p>
<p t="4051960" d="4899">You&#39;re - you have a relationship with someone,
and you discover that they have an affair.</p>
<p t="4056859" d="4391">Well, the discovery of the affair is going
to be something that&#39;s going to be meaningful.</p>
<p t="4061250" d="1819">Now, you don&#39;t know what the meaning is.</p>
<p t="4063069" d="4730">You&#39;re going to interpret it to begin with,
likely very negatively, except to the degree</p>
<p t="4067799" d="4621">that part of you would like to escape out
of the relationship, right, because sometimes</p>
<p t="4072420" d="3990">if you&#39;re betrayed, you&#39;re happy about it
because it’s time for that to be over with.</p>
<p t="4076410" d="4510">In any case, there are things that you can
encounter that you don&#39;t understand that are</p>
<p t="4080920" d="2160">meaningful in and of themselves.</p>
<p t="4083080" d="8160">So, I think that you actually can&#39;t separate
your structure from the structure of everything.</p>
<p t="4091240" d="5020">They’re always interacting, and meaning
emerges out of the interplay of them.</p>
<p t="4096260" d="2890">So, here’s another way of thinking about
it.</p>
<p t="4099150" d="2010">You&#39;re reading a book.</p>
<p t="4101160" d="1880">The book is meaningful.</p>
<p t="4103040" d="1120">Where is the meaning?</p>
<p t="4104160" d="2520">Is it in your head?</p>
<p t="4106680" d="1810">Is it in the book?</p>
<p t="4108490" d="5500">Well, it’s very difficult to say, right,
because obviously there&#39;s a subjective element</p>
<p t="4113990" d="1000">to it.</p>
<p t="4114990" d="5730">There&#39;s an element that&#39;s unique to you, but
just as obviously, that meaning wouldn&#39;t manifest</p>
<p t="4120720" d="4620">itself if it wasn&#39;t for the book, and of course
the book wouldn&#39;t be meaningful if you and</p>
<p t="4125340" d="4590">the book weren&#39;t embedded in this complex
structure, and so the meaning is an emergent</p>
<p t="4129930" d="6020">property -- the meaning is an emergent property
of the interplay of all of the elements of</p>
<p t="4135950" d="1900">being.</p>
<p t="4137850" d="3270">That&#39;s a very interesting way of looking at
things, so you have all these elements of</p>
<p t="4141120" d="4350">being, and their dance produces meaning of
one form or another.</p>
<p t="4145470" d="5060">Now, you might say, if you were a phenomenologist,
that some of that meaning is going to be life</p>
<p t="4150530" d="5100">sustaining, and some of it is going to be
life destroying, and the phenomenologist would</p>
<p t="4155630" d="7450">say from a clinical perspective, that you’re
-- if you’re… if you exist in a system</p>
<p t="4163080" d="4870">of meaning revelations that are life destroying,
that you should turn your attention away from</p>
<p t="4167950" d="6380">them towards meanings that are life affirming,
and you know, one of the things that’s quite</p>
<p t="4174330" d="4020">interesting about the phenomenological perspective
is that you could experiment with it quite</p>
<p t="4178350" d="1000">easily.</p>
<p t="4179350" d="4760">So I could say to you, for example, a couple
of phenomenological experiments, one would</p>
<p t="4184110" d="7840">be, for the next two weeks, you want to detach
yourself in some sense, so that you&#39;re a curious</p>
<p t="4191950" d="1480">observer of your being.</p>
<p t="4193430" d="6590">You&#39;re not necessarily trying to direct it,
you know, you&#39;re just trying to let it unfold,</p>
<p t="4200020" d="7320">and then what you might want to watch for
is when the meaning that manifests itself</p>
<p t="4207340" d="8270">as things flow around you is clearly meaning
of the life affirming type.</p>
<p t="4215610" d="4010">Now you’ll see that, you know, it depends
on how well situated you are in some sense</p>
<p t="4219620" d="7730">because if you&#39;re -- if you&#39;re surrounded
by -- if your experiential field is primarily</p>
<p t="4227350" d="4400">negative, these are going to be relatively
rare events, but they will still not be non-existent.</p>
<p t="4231750" d="4450">That might only happen for a few seconds,
or a few minutes everyday, or every two days,</p>
<p t="4236200" d="4910">but so say, okay you notice all of a sudden
that you&#39;re in a place where things are the</p>
<p t="4241110" d="1720">way you would like them to be.</p>
<p t="4242830" d="4600">So you could say you&#39;re in a place where being
is manifesting itself as acceptable.</p>
<p t="4247430" d="4320">Okay, so that&#39;s a place where nihilism is
not appropriate.</p>
<p t="4251750" d="4880">It doesn&#39;t apply because the quality of the
experience is such that it’s life affirming.</p>
<p t="4256630" d="1490">You have to notice that.</p>
<p t="4258120" d="5140">It’s something that happens, and then you
might ask yourself, well okay, what are the</p>
<p t="4263260" d="6710">preconditions that enable that -- what are
the preconditions that enabled all of the</p>
<p t="4269970" d="6360">different subelements of being to work harmoniously
together at that time and place so that that</p>
<p t="4276330" d="2230">was the meaning that emerged?</p>
<p t="4278560" d="5810">And then the next question might be, how would
it be possible for me to allow that to happen</p>
<p t="4284370" d="2080">more frequently?</p>
<p t="4286450" d="5750">And so you can tilt yourself towards life
affirming meanings and away from… from,</p>
<p t="4292200" d="4690">say, meanings that are associated with despair
and nihilism, but you do that partly -- it’s</p>
<p t="4296890" d="2000">almost like you&#39;re navigating in a boat.</p>
<p t="4298890" d="1370">In fact, I think you are.</p>
<p t="4300260" d="4970">I think you&#39;re navigating to find the line
between order and chaos because that&#39;s where</p>
<p t="4305230" d="1000">the meaning is.</p>
<p t="4306230" d="3840">That&#39;s exactly where the meaning is, and you
could feel it like it’s a place, and that&#39;s</p>
<p t="4310070" d="3340">the other thing that phenomenologists are
trying to get across.</p>
<p t="4313410" d="2160">These things are real.</p>
<p t="4315570" d="3320">They&#39;re not secondary manifestations of some
deeper reality.</p>
<p t="4318890" d="1950">They are reality itself.</p>
<p t="4320840" d="4010">I also think, and we’ll talk about this
more when we get to the neuropsychological</p>
<p t="4324850" d="5250">portion of the course, that your brain is
actually set up first and foremost to detect</p>
<p t="4330100" d="1000">meaning.</p>
<p t="4331100" d="7210">You detect meaning before you detect object,
and it’s partly because you have to detect</p>
<p t="4338310" d="4760">meaning so that you know what to do when something
happens very rapidly, and there are times</p>
<p t="4343070" d="3800">when you have to figure out what to do before
you have enough time to even see what’s</p>
<p t="4346870" d="1000">there.</p>
<p t="4347870" d="4140">You just don&#39;t have the time, and so you know,
part of the question is well, what exactly</p>
<p t="4352010" d="2300">do you mean by meaning, you know.</p>
<p t="4354310" d="5180">I think meaning is significance for behavior
or significance for the structure that governs</p>
<p t="4359490" d="5020">behavior, but those are very, very basic fundamental
perceptions.</p>
<p t="4364510" d="3010">They&#39;re not -- you see the object, and then
you derive the meaning.</p>
<p t="4367520" d="2720">It’s exactly the opposite in many cases.</p>
<p t="4370240" d="5270">You perceive the meaning and derive the object,
and there&#39;s plenty of neurophysiological evidence</p>
<p t="4375510" d="1000">for that.</p>
<p t="4376510" d="6790">For example, you have lots of, you know, your
retina is a pattern detector, and the retinal</p>
<p t="4383300" d="4980">information is transmitted to your brain along
the optic nerve, but the optic nerve branches</p>
<p t="4388280" d="2420">and it goes lots of places in your body.</p>
<p t="4390700" d="4920">Some of it maps right onto your spinal cord,
so that your eyes can make your body move.</p>
<p t="4395620" d="4560">Some of it maps onto your amygdala so that
what you perceive are the meanings of facial</p>
<p t="4400180" d="2130">expressions, without even perceiving the face.</p>
<p t="4402310" d="4680">So you can have people who have blindsight,
a damaged visual cortex, you can show them</p>
<p t="4406990" d="6280">angry faces which they say they can&#39;t see,
but they&#39;ll respond to them electrophysiologically</p>
<p t="4413270" d="5120">as if they&#39;re being exposed to something negative,
and it’s because the retinal pattern is</p>
<p t="4418390" d="4770">manifesting itself right onto the system that
maps one form of meaning.</p>
<p t="4423160" d="5530">So you can clearly have meaning without object
perception, and so the idea that you derive</p>
<p t="4428690" d="4040">the meaning from the object -- you see the
thing, and then you attribute meaning to the</p>
<p t="4432730" d="7030">thing -- that&#39;s right at some levels of analysis,
but it’s wrong at many other levels of analysis.</p>
<p t="4439760" d="7360">And so, the other thing that I think that
you can try that’s phenomenologically informed.</p>
<p t="4447120" d="2080">This is quite an interesting trick.</p>
<p t="4449200" d="3740">It’s really hard on you though, so be careful
if you try this.</p>
<p t="4452940" d="4140">So, one other thing that you can try for two
weeks is to watch what you say.</p>
<p t="4457080" d="2490">You got to detach yourself again.</p>
<p t="4459570" d="10720">You have to remove the belief that your thoughts
and you are the same thing, and then you have</p>
<p t="4470290" d="6560">to watch mostly what you say, and then you
have to see -- and this is something that</p>
<p t="4476850" d="4930">Rogers would also be an advocate of -- you
have to see if what you say makes you feel</p>
<p t="4481780" d="6950">-- you have to see if what you say improves
the quality of your being or makes it worse,</p>
<p t="4488730" d="4970">and you know, if you stop believing in what
you say and watch what the consequences are</p>
<p t="4493700" d="5440">instead, how it manifests itself in terms
of a transformation of being, then you can</p>
<p t="4499140" d="4610">also learn how to only say things that improve
the quality of being.</p>
<p t="4503750" d="6060">Well, that&#39;s a good thing if you can manage
it, but it’s terrifying in some sense because</p>
<p t="4509810" d="4730">one of the things that you’ll find is that
hardly anything that you say does that.</p>
<p t="4514540" d="4410">Most of it is neutral, but a fair bit of it
has exactly the opposite consequence.</p>
<p t="4518950" d="3300">It makes things worse.</p>
<p t="4522250" d="6940">So, I think I mentioned that the word phenomena
-- that&#39;s where the phenomenology, the term</p>
<p t="4529190" d="1870">phenomenology comes from, obviously.</p>
<p t="4531060" d="5000">The term phenomena means -- it’s from the
Greek word, “phainesthai,” and phainesthai</p>
<p t="4536060" d="2410">means “to shine forth.”</p>
<p t="4538470" d="7810">And so, the phenomenologists’ argument is
that being is made up of meanings that shine</p>
<p t="4546280" d="3360">forth for you and that those different meanings
attract you.</p>
<p t="4549640" d="3000">They&#39;re like -- they&#39;re like guideposts that
you can follow.</p>
<p t="4552640" d="4360">So you know, one of the -- I’ve noticed
this, for example, in relationship to reading.</p>
<p t="4557000" d="4360">So I’ll be reading a complex text, and some
passage will really strike me.</p>
<p t="4561360" d="2360">So it manifests itself as meaningful.</p>
<p t="4563720" d="1480">Why is that?</p>
<p t="4565200" d="5420">Well, you know, one of the phenomenologists,
which would be Binswanger, would say, well</p>
<p t="4570620" d="4800">it’s because of the way that I’m structured,
but Boss would say, well no, it’s a dance</p>
<p t="4575420" d="7230">that&#39;s occurring within the structure of everything
and the consequence of that is the manifestation</p>
<p t="4582650" d="1090">of this meaning.</p>
<p t="4583740" d="5900">Well, what I found is that I can follow threads
of meaning through books, you know, that it’s</p>
<p t="4589640" d="5220">like it’s something that&#39;s guiding me, that
sense of meaning, and often if I find something</p>
<p t="4594860" d="4350">within a book that&#39;s meaningful, then I’ll
read the other things that that person wrote,</p>
<p t="4599210" d="4620">and I’ll see that some of the people that
they read have meaningful things to say, and</p>
<p t="4603830" d="4840">then I can branch out that network, and it’s
following a pathway that&#39;s laid out for you,</p>
<p t="4608670" d="5580">in some sense it’s laid out for you in the
world, and you know, the phenomenological</p>
<p t="4614250" d="7350">idea is that if you follow that pathway, then
what happens is being becomes more and more</p>
<p t="4621600" d="9000">integrated around you, and those experiences
of intrinsic meaning start to multiply and</p>
<p t="4630600" d="5640">increase in intensity, and you know, if you&#39;re
able to do that over a long period of time,</p>
<p t="4636240" d="6200">then you can get more and more of the totality
of your being revealing the kind of meanings</p>
<p t="4642440" d="4040">that&#39;s stopped you from being either nihilistic
or totalitarian.</p>
<p t="4646480" d="6300">And so, well, that&#39;s the basic -- that&#39;s the
fundamental theory of phenomenological psychotherapy,</p>
<p t="4652780" d="1000">you know.</p>
<p t="4653780" d="3640">You might first say, well you know, you&#39;re
depressed and anxious and your life isn&#39;t</p>
