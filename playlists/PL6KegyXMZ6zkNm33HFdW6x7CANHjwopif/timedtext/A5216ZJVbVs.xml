<p t="3000" d="3000">I&#39;m not an atheist anymore because</p>
<p t="6000" d="3000">I don&#39;t look at the world that way anymore</p>
<p t="9000" d="2000">I&#39;m not a materialist anymore. I don&#39;t</p>
<p t="11000" d="3000">think the world&#39;s made out of matter</p>
<p t="14000" d="3000">I think it&#39;s made out of what matters. It&#39;s made out of meaning.</p>
<p t="17000" d="4000">Look at it from a... from the perspective of modern brain science</p>
<p t="21000" d="2000">What we orient towards unconsciously,</p>
<p t="23000" d="3000">which means what captures our attention, is meaning</p>
<p t="26000" d="3000">and it captures our attention before we know what it is</p>
<p t="29000" d="5000">The brain acts as if the world&#39;s made out of information or made out of meaning</p>
<p t="34000" d="3000">Heidegger, for example, German philosopher,</p>
<p t="37000" d="3000">was convinced that the world was made out of meaning essentially</p>
<p t="40000" d="4000">And that people&#39;s primary interaction</p>
<p t="44000" d="3000">with being was interaction with meaning</p>
<p t="47000" d="2000">And that isn&#39;t what modern people think because</p>
<p t="49000" d="2000">they&#39;re deeply materialistic</p>
<p t="51000" d="2000">If you go back 400 years or 500 years</p>
<p t="53000" d="3000">and you look at what people meant when they said matter</p>
<p t="56000" d="4000">which is what things are made out of. What they thought matter was</p>
<p t="60000" d="3000">isn&#39;t like what we think it is. It wasn&#39;t like</p>
<p t="63000" d="3000">this material stuff sort of like dirt</p>
<p t="66000" d="3000">that everything was made out of it. It was...</p>
<p t="69000" d="2000">It was much more complicated than that</p>
<p t="71000" d="4000">The problem with the standard view of matter is that it doesn&#39;t really deal with the fact</p>
<p t="75000" d="3000">that matter comes in arrays and in patterns</p>
<p t="78000" d="3000">and the patterns and the arrays, which is sort of</p>
<p t="81000" d="4000">lost when you think about atoms. That&#39;s where all the action is</p>
<p t="85000" d="1000">that&#39;s where the reality is.</p>
<p t="86000" d="2000">&#39;In the beggining&#39;</p>
<p t="88000" d="4000">God creates Adam and Eve explicitly in his own image</p>
<p t="92000" d="3000">There&#39;s a variety of interpretations about the first</p>
<p t="95000" d="3000">being that God created</p>
<p t="98000" d="3000">So there&#39;s a tradition in medieval Christianity</p>
<p t="101000" d="3000">and Judaism as well, that the first man was</p>
<p t="104000" d="4000">hermaphroditic. Male and female together</p>
<p t="108000" d="3000">And then separated into two separate entities</p>
<p t="111000" d="3000">Which then were forever looking to be rejoined</p>
<p t="114000" d="4000">And there&#39;s a very profound psychological idea there which is that</p>
<p t="118000" d="3000">the union of masculine and feminine</p>
<p t="121000" d="3000">produces a kind of perfect wholeness</p>
<p t="124000" d="3000">and you can think about that as being expressed biologically</p>
<p t="127000" d="3000">given that males need females</p>
<p t="130000" d="3000">and masculine needs feminine. But you can also think about it as</p>
<p t="133000" d="3000">different aspects of the psyche</p>
<p t="136000" d="3000">or between people or different aspects of the psyche</p>
<p t="139000" d="3000">within people. So whatever consciousness is</p>
<p t="142000" d="4000">it comes in masculine and feminine embodiments</p>
<p t="146000" d="3000">The masculine and the feminine embodiment are equally</p>
<p t="149000" d="4000">representations of God. Which I think is quite remarkable</p>
<p t="153000" d="3000">Because there´s a whole line of feminist criticism of the Western tradition</p>
<p t="156000" d="3000">That makes the presumption that the whole structure is patriarchal</p>
<p t="159000" d="3000">And I don&#39;t think that&#39;s true. If it was</p>
<p t="162000" d="3000">patriarchal, it would have been man that was created</p>
<p t="165000" d="3000">in the image of God. And it is explicitly not that.</p>
<p t="168000" d="3000">What feminine and masculine</p>
<p t="171000" d="3000">as well as being markers for gender behavior are</p>
<p t="174000" d="3000">also symbolic categories and the</p>
<p t="177000" d="3000">feminine symbolic category is the</p>
<p t="180000" d="3000">Genetrix of things, the matrix. Because</p>
<p t="183000" d="3000">the female is associated with the act of...</p>
<p t="186000" d="2000">with the most fundamental aspects</p>
<p t="188000" d="3000">of the act of reproduction. So it&#39;s out</p>
<p t="191000" d="2000">of the feminine that new forms spring</p>
<p t="193000" d="3000">For example, new forms come out of what</p>
<p t="196000" d="2000">you don&#39;t understand. That&#39;s the matrix</p>
<p t="198000" d="3000">of being and new biological forms come</p>
<p t="201000" d="2000">come out of a feminine substrate</p>
<p t="203000" d="5000">that&#39;s female creatures and so the masculine</p>
<p t="208000" d="4000">aspect is more seminal in the symbolic</p>
<p t="212000" d="2000">sense of that. The seminal idea is the</p>
<p t="214000" d="3000">instigator, so to speak, and it&#39;s also...</p>
<p t="217000" d="2000">it also stands in mythology for a kind of</p>
<p t="219000" d="4000">logical clarity and cutting.</p>
<p t="223000" d="2000">Whereas the feminine stands for more like</p>
<p t="225000" d="3000">something that&#39;s whole and undifferentiated</p>
<p t="228000" d="2000">There&#39;s some suggestion in the story of Adam and</p>
<p t="230000" d="3000">Eve that the woman is the primary food sharer</p>
<p t="233000" d="2000">And I think that&#39;s associated in some</p>
<p t="235000" d="2750">way with her ability to make Adam self-conscious,</p>
<p t="237750" d="2250">which is exactly what she does</p>
<p t="240000" d="2000">she offers him something that makes him</p>
<p t="242000" d="2600">self-conscious and she becomes self-conscious</p>
<p t="244600" d="1400">also as a consequence.</p>
<p t="246000" d="3000">Women make men self-conscious.</p>
<p t="249000" d="2000">You can&#39;t think of a truth</p>
<p t="251000" d="2000">that&#39;s truer than that and the reason</p>
<p t="253000" d="2000">they do it is because they&#39;re very</p>
<p t="255000" d="2000">selective and most men they reject</p>
<p t="257000" d="2000">&#39;Adam&#39;s shame&#39;</p>
<p t="259000" d="1000">So God comes up and he&#39;s looking</p>
<p t="260000" d="2000">for Adam because he&#39;s used to wandering around</p>
<p t="262000" d="2000">with him and Adam&#39;s hiding</p>
<p t="264000" d="3000">behind a bush, which says something about Adams level of intelligence</p>
<p t="267000" d="2000">first, because, you know, God can see</p>
<p t="269000" d="2000">through bushes. But it also says</p>
<p t="271000" d="1000">something about his level of</p>
<p t="272000" d="2000">self-consciousness because what it means</p>
<p t="274000" d="3000">is that when Adam becomes self-conscious</p>
<p t="277000" d="3000">he no longer believes that the fact that</p>
<p t="280000" d="2000">he was made in the image of God is</p>
<p t="282000" d="3000">sufficient to give him stature and so</p>
<p t="285000" d="2000">God says well who told you were naked</p>
<p t="287000" d="3000">and this is where this is really Adam&#39;s</p>
<p t="290000" d="3000">fall, I think. He says it was the woman</p>
<p t="293000" d="3000">He blames her which is really pathological</p>
<p t="296000" d="2000">the woman you gave me it was</p>
<p t="298000" d="2000">her fault. Yeah, she made you self-conscious</p>
<p t="300000" d="2000">Well, hooray. You know you woke up there&#39;s</p>
<p t="302000" d="2000">something to be said for that</p>
<p t="304000" d="2000">Now women torture men into being awake</p>
<p t="306000" d="3000">And I don&#39;t suppose that&#39;s always received with gratitude</p>
<p t="309000" d="1000">&#39;Paradise Lost&#39;</p>
<p t="310000" d="2000">John Milton, he wrote Paradise Lost</p>
<p t="312000" d="2000">for two reasons. One was to justify the ways</p>
<p t="314000" d="5000">of God to man. And the second rationale</p>
<p t="319000" d="3000">for his writing was to codify</p>
<p t="322000" d="3000">mythologies, stories that were</p>
<p t="325000" d="1000">in some ways peripheral</p>
<p t="326000" d="3000">to canonical Christianity, into a single coherent</p>
<p t="329000" d="2000">narrative. Here&#39;s a question he tried</p>
<p t="331000" d="4000">to answer, which was: Well if God was</p>
<p t="335000" d="3000">all-knowing why would he set Adam</p>
<p t="338000" d="3000">and Eve up to fall. And Milton has a very</p>
<p t="341000" d="2000">sophisticated answer to that and it is</p>
<p t="343000" d="3000">that people truly have free will and</p>
<p t="346000" d="2000">even if God knew that they were</p>
<p t="348000" d="4000">going to fall, there was nothing he could do</p>
<p t="352000" d="1000">to stop that</p>
<p t="353000" d="3000">except deny them free will and</p>
<p t="356000" d="4000">free will is so valuable that that denial</p>
<p t="360000" d="1000">was not going to happen</p>
<p t="361000" d="3000">Dostoyevsky points out that freedom</p>
<p t="364000" d="2000">happens to be very important to people</p>
<p t="366000" d="2000">and even arbitrary freedom. Like</p>
<p t="368000" d="2000">people want the freedom to go to hell</p>
<p t="370000" d="2000">in a hand basket, even. They don&#39;t want</p>
<p t="372000" d="2000">constraints they&#39;re willing to put up</p>
<p t="374000" d="2000">with a lot to have their freedom and</p>
<p t="376000" d="3000">God&#39;s judgment is something like freedom</p>
<p t="379000" d="1000">is better than safety</p>
<p t="380000" d="1000">&#39;Why the snake&#39;</p>
<p t="381000" d="2000">The snake in the Garden of Eden is a really interesting</p>
<p t="383000" d="3000">character. Human beings and their closest</p>
<p t="386000" d="2000">biological relative chimpanzees</p>
<p t="388000" d="4000">are innately afraid of and attracted to</p>
<p t="392000" d="3000">reptiles. They automatically trigger off</p>
<p t="395000" d="2000">responses in a part of the brain called</p>
<p t="397000" d="2000">the amygdala that&#39;s associated with anxiety</p>
<p t="399000" d="2000">And I think the evolutionary</p>
<p t="401000" d="2000">reason for this is that mammals and</p>
<p t="403000" d="4000">reptiles have been at war in a sense</p>
<p t="407000" d="2000">over ecological turf for something</p>
<p t="409000" d="3000">between 60 million and 200 million years</p>
<p t="412000" d="2000">Reptilian features, which are</p>
<p t="414000" d="5000">cold-blooded, piercing eyed, toothed</p>
<p t="419000" d="5000">lurking, nocturnal. Out there, out and unknown</p>
<p t="424000" d="2000">out where chaos is.</p>
<p t="426000" d="4000">The snake is representative of the unknown in a sense</p>
<p t="430000" d="2000">and it&#39;s an ambivalent feature</p>
<p t="432000" d="2000">And you see that even it&#39;s</p>
<p t="434000" d="2000">use in mythology because for example</p>
<p t="436000" d="2000">the dragon in Western culture</p>
<p t="438000" d="3000">is a negative feature but in Chinese culture</p>
<p t="441000" d="2000">it&#39;s positive feature and so the unknown</p>
<p t="443000" d="2000">is like that, it&#39;s positive and negative</p>
<p t="445000" d="2000">The snake in the Garden of Eden is</p>
<p t="447000" d="2000">representative of all those things that</p>
<p t="449000" d="2000">lurk when you think you know what you&#39;re doing.</p>
<p t="451000" d="4000">And when you think you know what you&#39;re doing</p>
<p t="455000" d="1000">you&#39;ve carved out</p>
<p t="456000" d="1000">this little Eden, this little paradise</p>
<p t="457000" d="2000">in which you operates. But there&#39;s</p>
<p t="459000" d="2000">always something that&#39;s lurking and</p>
<p t="461000" d="1000">that&#39;s all the things you&#39;re not paying</p>
<p t="462000" d="2000">attention to. Well that&#39;s the snake and</p>
<p t="464000" d="3000">when that snake pops up people are... We&#39;re</p>
<p t="467000" d="2000">wired. If a little snake pops out we</p>
<p t="469000" d="2000">might want to run away from it but, like,</p>
<p t="471000" d="1000">we&#39;re curious about that. We&#39;re</p>
<p t="472000" d="2000">going to go over there and investigate it right away</p>
<p t="474000" d="3000">Now, when chimps come across a Python in</p>
<p t="477000" d="3000">the forest they have a specific cry. It&#39;s</p>
<p t="480000" d="2000">called a snake wrath. And the chimps,</p>
<p t="482000" d="3000">who don&#39;t like snakes, they don&#39;t run from it</p>
<p t="485000" d="2000">they back off. And then they watch the thing</p>
<p t="487000" d="3000">They cannot tear their eyes away from it</p>
<p t="490000" d="1000">And some of them will stand</p>
<p t="491000" d="1000">there and look at it for 10 minutes</p>
<p t="492000" d="2000">Other individuals will stand there</p>
<p t="494000" d="2000">for hours watching the snake</p>
<p t="496000" d="2000">The unknown is fascinating, we can&#39;t look</p>
<p t="498000" d="2000">away from it. We have to encounter it even</p>
<p t="500000" d="2000">if it&#39;s terrifying. It&#39;s partly why</p>
<p t="502000" d="2000">you know, teenagers like horror movies.</p>
<p t="504000" d="3000">They&#39;re driven to look at the snake</p>
<p t="507000" d="3000">They&#39;re driven to interact with the snake</p>
<p t="510000" d="3000">In Genesis, of course, interacting with the</p>
<p t="513000" d="2000">snake means the end of paradise</p>
<p t="515000" d="2000">just like it does in life. There are</p>
<p t="517000" d="2000">ideas that the serpent in the Garden of</p>
<p t="519000" d="2000">Eden was Satan and trying</p>
<p t="521000" d="2000">to destroy God&#39;s handiwork.</p>
<p t="523000" d="3000">People often look back in their lives and they say: Well, you know</p>
<p t="526000" d="1000">I got knocked out of</p>
<p t="527000" d="2000">my little paradise by, you know, this particular</p>
<p t="529000" d="3000">event. But looking back, it really made me grow up</p>
<p t="532000" d="1000">it really made me mature</p>
<p t="533000" d="2000">Whatever it is, that&#39;s the serpent</p>
<p t="535000" d="2000">in the Garden of Eden, it certainly plays that</p>
<p t="537000" d="2000">role. It&#39;s a catalyst. Much of what&#39;s</p>
<p t="539000" d="2000">unknown is redemptive, much of what&#39;s</p>
<p t="541000" d="3000">unknown gives life savor. It provides</p>
<p t="544000" d="2000">the kind of excitement</p>
<p t="546000" d="2000">that justifies suffering. The injunction</p>
<p t="548000" d="3000">behind religious thought, fundamentally, is that</p>
<p t="551000" d="2000">you should live your life in such a way</p>
<p t="553000" d="2000">that the suffering it has to contain</p>
<p t="555000" d="2000">because you&#39;re confined and</p>
<p t="557000" d="2000">vulnerable, is justified.</p>
<p t="559000" d="2000">&#39;Profane world&#39;</p>
<p t="561000" d="4000">A profane world exists because paradise always falls apart</p>
<p t="565000" d="3000">And that&#39;s a catastrophe. That&#39;s the</p>
<p t="568000" d="1000">human catastrophe and maybe that&#39;s</p>
<p t="569000" d="3000">the original sin. And profane life is</p>
<p t="572000" d="2000">characterized by suffering, intense</p>
<p t="574000" d="2000">suffering and that&#39;s a terrible thing</p>
<p t="576000" d="3000">I mean it&#39;s so terrible that the first</p>
<p t="579000" d="2000">two people to really inhabit the profane</p>
<p t="581000" d="3000">world, Cain and Abel. Cain is</p>
<p t="584000" d="3000">so disturbed by the nature of the world</p>
<p t="587000" d="3000">that he turns into a revengeful</p>
<p t="590000" d="4000">homicidal, resentful, fascist</p>
<p t="594000" d="3000">authoritarian. And the father of war</p>
<p t="597000" d="2000">Well that&#39;s how bad</p>
<p t="599000" d="2000">profane existence can be</p>
<p t="601000" d="4000">But if you keep going in the same direction you can get so conscious</p>
<p t="605000" d="3000">that the profane conditions of</p>
<p t="608000" d="3000">being are no longer tragic</p>
<p t="611000" d="4000">They&#39;re acceptable. But you have to live well enough</p>
<p t="615000" d="3000">so that the suffering is worth it</p>
<p t="618000" d="2000">If you took advantage of every</p>
<p t="620000" d="2000">opportunity you had, if you crawl through</p>
<p t="622000" d="2000">every window that was open to you. If you</p>
<p t="624000" d="3000">lived as perfectly as you could</p>
<p t="627000" d="2000">your life would be justifiable on its own terms</p>
<p t="629000" d="2000">despite its suffering.</p>
<p t="631000" d="2000">And despite the tragedy in the world</p>
<p t="633000" d="1000">That&#39;s why Kierkegaard said that</p>
<p t="634000" d="2000">people are redeemed one by one</p>
<p t="636000" d="2000">and not in groups. You know it&#39;s an</p>
<p t="638000" d="2000">individual project</p>
<p t="640000" d="1000">&#39;What&#39;s evil?&#39;</p>
<p t="641000" d="3000">I would say human beings are built to take tragedy but they&#39;re not</p>
<p t="644000" d="2000">built to take evil. The most unsettling</p>
<p t="646000" d="3000">thing isn&#39;t that a close relative dies</p>
<p t="649000" d="2000">of cancer, unsettling as that is.</p>
<p t="651000" d="2000">The most unsettling thing is to be</p>
<p t="653000" d="2000">treated casually in a brutal manner</p>
<p t="655000" d="3000">for no other reason than the brutality itself</p>
<p t="658000" d="2000">That&#39;s what undermines your sense, your belief</p>
<p t="660000" d="2000">in human existence and in the value of</p>
<p t="662000" d="2000">human existence. That&#39;s what demoralizes</p>
<p t="664000" d="2000">and kills. Many social scientists</p>
<p t="666000" d="4000">in particular I would say, feel that the idea</p>
<p t="670000" d="3000">of evil is anachronistic</p>
<p t="673000" d="2000">The reason that evil is obliterated</p>
<p t="675000" d="3000">out of consciousness is because we don&#39;t have a</p>
<p t="678000" d="2000">theory to account for it</p>
<p t="680000" d="2000">We don´t have a framework within which</p>
<p t="682000" d="2000">it fits. Our religious ideations certainly</p>
<p t="684000" d="2000">provides that kind of framework</p>
<p t="686000" d="3000">I also think that we dismiss evil because it&#39;s</p>
<p t="689000" d="3000">such a terrifying phenomena and whenever</p>
<p t="692000" d="2000">it crops up its head everybody runs</p>
<p t="694000" d="1000">around saying: Well who could have</p>
<p t="695000" d="2000">predicted this? Who could have predicted this?</p>
<p t="697000" d="1000">But all you have to do is look</p>
<p t="698000" d="2000">and you can predict it. And the people</p>
<p t="700000" d="2000">who perpetrate it often say exactly</p>
<p t="702000" d="2000">what they&#39;re doing and why</p>
<p t="704000" d="2000">so the Columbine kids, for example</p>
<p t="706000" d="3000">they said something very much like:</p>
<p t="709000" d="3000">Well we&#39;ve taken a close look at existence and</p>
<p t="712000" d="3000">it isn&#39;t worthy. It&#39;s not worthy because</p>
<p t="715000" d="2000">people are limited and vulnerable and</p>
<p t="717000" d="2000">there&#39;s way too much suffering and</p>
<p t="719000" d="3000">suffering, vulnerable things are kind of</p>
<p t="722000" d="2000">despicable and it would be better if</p>
<p t="724000" d="2000">they were just all wiped out plus I&#39;m</p>
<p t="726000" d="3000">the guy to do it. And that&#39;s exactly, fundamentally, that&#39;s</p>
<p t="729000" d="2000">exactly what they claimed. You might say</p>
<p t="731000" d="2000">Well, why would someone come to that conclusion?</p>
<p t="733000" d="3000">It&#39;s like: That&#39;s not a good</p>
<p t="736000" d="2000">answer. Everyone comes to that</p>
<p t="738000" d="2000">conclusion from time to time. When they&#39;re</p>
<p t="740000" d="2000">disappointed or frustrated or when</p>
<p t="742000" d="2000">you know, their dreams have fallen apart or</p>
<p t="744000" d="1000">when someone near them suffers or...</p>
<p t="745000" d="3000">They doubt the utility, not only of their own</p>
<p t="748000" d="2000">existence, but of existence itself</p>
<p t="750000" d="4000">If it&#39;s taken far enough... Taken far enough</p>
<p t="754000" d="3000">that attitude engenders atrocity</p>
<p t="757000" d="2000">It&#39;s evil. And I think you can define it</p>
<p t="759000" d="2000">no problem, because people say well</p>
<p t="761000" d="3000">you can´t define evil. That&#39;s wrong</p>
<p t="764000" d="2000">Evil is the production of suffering for</p>
<p t="766000" d="3000">its own sake. That&#39;s simple</p>
<p t="769000" d="3000">And if you think people don&#39;t do that</p>
<p t="772000" d="4000">regularly, well you know, you just haven&#39;t been looking</p>
