<p t="14879" d="1981">I&#39;m here today with Ben Shapiro.</p>
<p t="16860" d="6019">Ben and I met about eight months ago, eh? He came up to Toronto and gave a rousing talk and...</p>
<p t="25529" d="6110">Talk about political correctness at that point, quite a politically appointed political talk, and I got a couple of questions for you.</p>
<p t="31890" d="4400">One is what are you planning to do in 2018?</p>
<p t="36290" d="2590">What do you want to see happen in 2018, personally?</p>
<p t="38880" d="3300">And what are you aiming at, and why?</p>
<p t="42680" d="7540">So I&#39;m aiming at broadening the reach of the the political messages that I espouse and the messages of,</p>
<p t="50620" d="3300">I think, personal responsibility and virtue that I try to espouse.</p>
<p t="53920" d="4959">I&#39;m also working on a book that I&#39;m really interested in right now about the roots of Western civilization.</p>
<p t="58880" d="4109">What is that makes for a happier and more fulfilled Western civilization?</p>
<p t="62989" d="2811">What generates purpose for a civilization and for individuals?</p>
<p t="65840" d="1940">And why it is that we seem to have lost purpose.</p>
<p t="67860" d="2620">Because my general theory is that the reason that we&#39;re trying to murder each other</p>
<p t="70480" d="3800">politically and the reason that we hate each other so much is that there is a</p>
<p t="74300" d="4400">purpose-shaped hole in our heart that we are now filling with anger, a tribal anger at each other.</p>
<p t="78900" d="3920">And I&#39;m trying to trace back, kind of backtrack, and say okay, where did where did we go wrong?</p>
<p t="82820" d="4220">Where was purpose at, sort of, its high-water mark and why are we now at low ebb?</p>
<p t="87920" d="7300">Okay, one of the things that I&#39;ve found in the discussions that I&#39;ve had over the last year, especially the public discussions,</p>
<p t="95300" d="5060">public lectures, let&#39;s say, is that it seems perfectly possible to</p>
<p t="100440" d="3940">make a room go silent by speaking to, especially if it&#39;s a room full of young men,</p>
<p t="104480" d="2440">by speaking to them about responsibility and truth.</p>
<p t="107620" d="4840">This has really staggered me because those are not obviously saleable messages.</p>
<p t="113260" d="4660">You know, especially for someone who&#39;s rather cynical about the fundamental nature of human beings.</p>
<p t="117920" d="6700">I&#39;m not saying that I am, but if you launched a business plan to the typical observers and said,</p>
<p t="124720" d="8740">&quot;Well, I&#39;m going to base a public movement on the adoption of excess responsibility and the requirement to speak the truth,</p>
<p t="133460" d="6840">and that&#39;s going to become hyper popular,&quot; the probability that people would agree that that&#39;s a possibility is pretty much zero.</p>
<p t="140960" d="2400">So I&#39;ve been thinking that</p>
<p t="143980" d="5640">we&#39;ve spoken about rights for so long and spoken about freedoms for so long, let&#39;s say since the early 60s,</p>
<p t="150200" d="5060">just essentially speaking, that we&#39;ve actually left a conceptual hole in our culture.</p>
<p t="156160" d="4680">And that seems to be akin to the point that you&#39;re making with regards to this book.</p>
<p t="160900" d="3700">And now, you mentioned responsibility, and why that specifically?</p>
<p t="165700" d="2480">Well, I think that what you&#39;re talking about is exactly right.</p>
<p t="168240" d="5660">People in the West have seemed to pose rights in direct opposition to duties.</p>
<p t="174020" d="4920">So the American founding, particularly, was obsessed with this idea of rights and individual rights.</p>
<p t="178940" d="3600">But there was also this corresponding idea of duties that&#39;s very clear in founding thinking.</p>
<p t="182600" d="2840">George Washington talks about duty. Benjamin Franklin talks about duty.</p>
<p t="185640" d="5180">The idea was that duty was to be socially generated, not by government, but by society itself.</p>
<p t="190820" d="3040">By small communities, by churches, by your family.</p>
<p t="194060" d="4280">And that that would fill the gap that allowed you to actually have a functioning society of rights.</p>
<p t="198340" d="2120">But we seem to have left duty completely behind.</p>
<p t="200460" d="2220">Now it&#39;s just all about the rights and not about the duty.</p>
<p t="202760" d="8820">And what&#39;s happened is that that&#39;s collapsed in on itself because the society of only rights and no duties ends up generating duties masquerading as rights.</p>
<p t="211680" d="4720">Positive rights that are actually not rights at all, that are actually me imposing a duty on you in order to further</p>
<p t="216400" d="1660">my own perception of my rights.</p>
<p t="218220" d="3200">And that&#39;s I think where we&#39;ve been going and it&#39;s a dark place.</p>
<p t="221760" d="2200">And it creates an enormous amount of opposition.</p>
<p t="224000" d="7500">When you say, Jordan, when you talk about the fact that people would not have thought of building a movement on notions of truth and responsibility,</p>
<p t="231600" d="4140">that&#39;s because, I think, for a long time, people just took it for granted that we all agreed on these things.</p>
<p t="235960" d="3480">But there&#39;s been an actual forcible counter movement for</p>
<p t="239560" d="2880">generations now, against both truth and responsibility.</p>
<p t="242500" d="1620">The idea is there&#39;s no objective truth.</p>
<p t="244400" d="2860">It&#39;s socially defined. We can make it up as we go along.</p>
<p t="247260" d="5160">There&#39;s no telos. I talk a lot in the new book about a teleological way of thinking.</p>
<p t="252420" d="3160">This idea that you actually have a purpose for which you were created.</p>
<p t="255620" d="2580">And that it&#39;s your job to fulfill that purpose.</p>
<p t="258200" d="2780">And that&#39;s completely been left by the wayside, so there&#39;s no truth.</p>
<p t="261020" d="5940">There&#39;s no capacity, even the scientific materialist worldview actually robs you of the capacity to even change yourself.</p>
<p t="267260" d="3600">The studies that I&#39;ve seen suggest that if you believe in a certain form of determinism,</p>
<p t="270860" d="3860">if you believe in hard determinism, you&#39;re less likely to go out and actually change your life and make it better</p>
<p t="274720" d="2000">because you buy into your own philosophy.</p>
<p t="276960" d="1800">And I think that as a society, we&#39;ve sort of bought into that,</p>
<p t="278760" d="4480">that we&#39;re all victims of our own biology, victims of our own race, victims of our own ethnicity or our situation,</p>
<p t="283360" d="1300">and there&#39;s no way for us to get out of that.</p>
<p t="284660" d="4200">And so we may as well throw up our hands or at least give the power to the only thing that can change things,</p>
<p t="288900" d="5440">which is this massive collective that comes in and is the boot stomping on the human face forever.</p>
<p t="295040" d="2580">Well, there&#39;s also the strange misapprehension,</p>
<p t="297700" d="8360">I think, with regards to the nature of rights, because as far as I can tell, rights are a multi-faceted phenomena.</p>
<p t="306340" d="5160">But I think the least metaphysical claim that you can make about rights</p>
<p t="311560" d="4700">is that if I have a right, then that brings with it a parallel responsibility,</p>
<p t="316440" d="5960">not only to myself, to act in a manner that is in accordance with that right, whatever that happens to be,</p>
<p t="322400" d="2160">but I also have a responsibility,</p>
<p t="324840" d="3680">if the right is universal, to act in a certain manner towards you.</p>
<p t="328940" d="5000">Because there is no difference between rights and responsibilities, fundamentally.</p>
<p t="334000" d="2140">They&#39;re just the mirror image of one another.</p>
<p t="336140" d="3460">Now that&#39;s to say nothing about their potential metaphysical origin.</p>
<p t="339680" d="1260">I don&#39;t want to talk about that.</p>
<p t="340940" d="8900">But it doesn&#39;t seem to me to be logically tenable to have an infinite conversation about rights without having a parallel conversation about responsibility.</p>
<p t="350140" d="4280">So there&#39;s a logical flaw in it that leaves that gap that needs to be filled.</p>
<p t="354760" d="2180">And then the other thing that&#39;s occurred to me</p>
<p t="357580" d="760">is that</p>
<p t="358660" d="4240">the genuine meaning in life, and I do believe that life has a genuine meaning,</p>
<p t="362900" d="3340">I think I could make that claim without even making it metaphysical,</p>
<p t="366260" d="4560">although I don&#39;t mind the metaphysical addition to it</p>
<p t="370820" d="7120">It seems to me that almost all the things that people find meaningful in life that aren&#39;t merely impulsive pleasures, which, of course,</p>
<p t="378020" d="4640">create their own entanglements, have to do with the voluntary adoption of responsibility.</p>
<p t="383880" d="6500">So families are like that, okay. So then here&#39;s the next question.</p>
<p t="391640" d="6520">What do you think it is that&#39;s driven our loss of that half of the conversation? What&#39;s happened?</p>
<p t="399180" d="1740">So I think that this has been</p>
<p t="400920" d="5209">basically a 200-year movement that first manifested itself in Europe and is finally reaching American shores about a hundred years later.</p>
<p t="406130" d="2340">Which seems to be the pattern. All the bad stuff from Europe</p>
<p t="408600" d="3520">hits Europe about 50 to 100 years before it hits here, and now it comes here.</p>
<p t="412280" d="7420">I think that what happened here is that the enlightenment mentality was built on certain fundamental premises, including the use of human reason, the capacity for free will.</p>
<p t="419700" d="5640">And all of that in turn rested on assumptions about the universe including the idea that the universe has a</p>
<p t="425420" d="5420">discoverable design that we can actually find and pursue and that in doing so we will find happiness.</p>
<p t="430900" d="5980">The Aristotelian idea of happiness is very much bound up with the idea of you fulfilling your telos.</p>
<p t="437020" d="3460">The Judeo-Christian idea of happiness is you fulfilling God&#39;s purpose for you.</p>
<p t="440480" d="3900">There is always this idea of a higher purpose that you were seeking and I think what happened is that</p>
<p t="444380" d="8060">the enlightenment project, which started off in an attempt really in the 13th century by people like Aquinas and Maimonides to unite religion and science,</p>
<p t="452620" d="2260">fell apart when they started to divide the two.</p>
<p t="454880" d="8100">We&#39;re seeking the same thing. Religion and science are both seeking universal truths that can be applicable to our own lives and make us more fulfilled.</p>
<p t="463000" d="4220">The project of science became to destroy one pole, to destroy religion.</p>
<p t="467220" d="3560">And then by doing that, science almost turned in on itself. Reason almost ate itself.</p>
<p t="470780" d="9380">So I think reason basically turned into, okay, we&#39;re going to follow to the logical end point all of the non-religious bases of human thought.</p>
<p t="480220" d="7520">And once you do that, it&#39;s very difficult not to fall into a sort of self-refuting trap about human thought.</p>
<p t="487740" d="5060">You&#39;re just a set of neurons that are firing. Neurons don&#39;t have responsibility.Your dog doesn&#39;t have responsibility.</p>
<p t="492800" d="4080">Do you have responsibility? You are a product of your environment, your biology.</p>
<p t="496880" d="3760">Does that carry with it any sort of moral responsibility? You don&#39;t have the capacity to choose.</p>
<p t="500740" d="2440">If you don&#39;t have the capacity to choose, how do you have moral responsibility?</p>
<p t="503180" d="6740">I debated Sam Harris on particularly, this issue, and I thought that actually the most telling point of the debate and discussion was not anything the two of us said.</p>
<p t="510000" d="3020">It was a woman who got up at the very end and said to Sam, &quot;I totally agree with you.</p>
<p t="513020" d="1890">&quot;There&#39;s no free will in the hard sense.</p>
<p t="514910" d="4500">&quot;You can&#39;t make any... see, there&#39;s no choice other than TO, right? You will have to do this,</p>
<p t="519410" d="4289">&quot;just driven by your biology and environment. But I have a five year old son, what do you want--</p>
<p t="523700" d="2780">&quot;What should I say to him?&quot; and Sam basically said, &quot;Lie.&quot;</p>
<p t="526540" d="6440">Right? He basically said, &quot;Well, tell him that he&#39;s capable of making a choice and that that&#39;s the truth about civilization.&quot;</p>
<p t="532980" d="4540">Either you believe that&#39;s a lie and you&#39;re actively engaging in plato&#39;s good lie, basically,</p>
<p t="537580" d="8460">or you have to believe in free will. And I don&#39;t think the capacity to choose in the capacity to self better is a lie.</p>
<p t="546040" d="1800">I think that people do have the capacity to do that.</p>
<p t="547840" d="6220">I think even Sam believes that, but he refuses to acknowledge it because otherwise I don&#39;t think it would be in the educational position that he is, right?</p>
<p t="554060" d="2940">He spends his life trying to people, so that it&#39;s all weird.</p>
<p t="557009" d="2040">I mean, I actually said in the in the discussion,</p>
<p t="559049" d="5551">&quot;Why are we all in this auditorium? We were just sort of predestined by the universe to be in this auditorium at a certain time?</p>
<p t="564600" d="3460">&quot;Do you bring the feel fulfilled by that? If so, you really have no choice in the matter.&quot;</p>
<p t="568720" d="5000">Well one of the things that&#39;s always bothered me about the new atheist types and the hyper-rationalists</p>
<p t="573720" d="5000">is that, as far as I can tell, their conduct is full of performative contradictions</p>
<p t="578720" d="1980">They say they believe certain things,</p>
<p t="580709" d="1930">but they don&#39;t act that way.</p>
<p t="582640" d="6280">And in my sense because I&#39;m an existentialist at heart, is that what you believe is what you act out.</p>
<p t="588920" d="3260">What you say might be in accordance with that and it might not.</p>
<p t="592180" d="6620">But there&#39;s no reason to assume that your beliefs are transparent to yourself, regardless of your claims.</p>
<p t="599040" d="10140">And so I also don&#39;t see any evidence whatsoever that a society can exist that functions over any reasonable period of time, in any reasonable manner,</p>
<p t="609320" d="6520">without predicating itself on the belief that people are both capable of free will and that they&#39;re responsible.</p>
<p t="616360" d="7780">And so, the fact that it seems to be impossible to build a functioning society, or even functioning dyadic relationships for that matter,</p>
<p t="624140" d="4760">in the absence of the presupposition of free will and the capacity for voluntary change,</p>
<p t="629140" d="4760">indicates to me some evidence for the existence of those capacities.</p>
<p t="633900" d="6280">And you have to be a staggeringly cynical person to think that no, we just have to believe that that&#39;s true even though it&#39;s a lie,</p>
<p t="640180" d="3300">and predicate our cultures on that. First of all I don&#39;t...</p>
<p t="645480" d="6580">I think it&#39;s a weak claim. I don&#39;t think that--it&#39;s also not the rock upon which you want to found your culture.</p>
<p t="652600" d="7020">So one of the things that struck me about the mythological stories that I&#39;ve immersed myself in, is that there&#39;s always three,</p>
<p t="659620" d="3400">there&#39;s always three prime characters in a mythological story.</p>
<p t="663020" d="3060">There&#39;s culture, right? So that&#39;s the Great Father,</p>
<p t="666080" d="4700">let&#39;s say, in his many mythological guises. And there&#39;s nature. That&#39;s the Great Mother.</p>
<p t="670780" d="4640">And so you could say that that&#39;s the biology and society of the modern scientists.</p>
<p t="675420" d="3700">But then there&#39;s the independent individual as a causal force,</p>
<p t="679520" d="5300">who has a nature that enables choice and free will and all of those things.</p>
<p t="685060" d="6180">And that independent third factor is something like the Logos that gives rise to being at the beginning of time, right?</p>
<p t="691360" d="2880">That calls order forth out of chaos.</p>
<p t="694480" d="7500">And the fact that we can&#39;t account for that scientifically, although, I don&#39;t think we can deny it either, doesn&#39;t mean that it doesn&#39;t exist.</p>
<p t="703280" d="980">Yeah, I totally agree with that.</p>
<p t="704260" d="5260">And, of course, I enjoy Maps of Meaning, so I&#39;m pretty familiar with the terminology that you use, because I&#39;ve read your book.</p>
<p t="709520" d="1950">But I think that you know there&#39;s</p>
<p t="711470" d="3490">this idea that you can find meaning in a meaningless universe.</p>
<p t="714960" d="3429">That we&#39;re just meatballs wandering through space with a little bit of sentience.</p>
<p t="719090" d="1820">Understanding that we&#39;re meatballs wandering through space.</p>
<p t="720910" d="3000">I have a hard time building any sort of system on that.</p>
<p t="724070" d="6169">And the refusal of the new atheist to even recognize that the morality that they promulgate, right, the rip that they have on religion typically</p>
<p t="730240" d="4960">is that religion is barbaric and backwards and promulgates all sorts of horrible moral values with which they disagree.</p>
<p t="735540" d="4640">And what they refuse to acknowledge is that their moral values are predicated within that system.</p>
<p t="740360" d="4820">For the vast majority of human time, the values that they are espousing are not only not universal,</p>
<p t="745180" d="3860">they&#39;re not even minority values. They didn&#39;t exist for the vast majority of human time.</p>
<p t="749040" d="7620">They are absolute creations of a Judeo-Christian system that is combined with Greek reason to come up with what we have today.</p>
<p t="756660" d="2860">And this is essentially the theory that I have come up with, is that,</p>
<p t="759680" d="2119">and this is the thesis of the book that I&#39;m writing right now,</p>
<p t="761860" d="4880">which is that in order for in order for a society or an individual to feel fulfilled,</p>
<p t="766740" d="1420">you basically have to have four things.</p>
<p t="768160" d="3040">You have to have an individual purpose, you have to feel like you have a purpose in the world.</p>
<p t="771200" d="1540">You personally have a purpose in the world.</p>
<p t="772740" d="5320">You have to feel like you have an individual capacity. You have to feel like you are capable of pursuing that with alacrity.</p>
<p t="778060" d="5520">You have to have a communal purpose. You have to feel like you along with others are pursuing a higher goal that means something.</p>
<p t="783580" d="5459">And you have to have communal capacity, so a system that has been built that allows that community to activate when it needs to activate</p>
<p t="789040" d="2860">and back off so that the individual can exist in that vacuum.</p>
<p t="792140" d="5080">And we have torn away at all the roots of those things because of all of those things</p>
<p t="797220" d="6160">that, I think the apotheosis of--I think the apex of modern thought was basically the unfulfilled</p>
<p t="803380" d="2740">but universal theories of the the American Founding Fathers.</p>
<p t="806120" d="2820">I think it&#39;s about as good as it got in terms governmental theory.</p>
<p t="808960" d="3460">I don&#39;t think it&#39;s gotten better since then. I think that it&#39;s been extended more broadly.</p>
<p t="812420" d="4700">I think the Universalism that they were implying has now been applied in many ways, and that&#39;s a great thing, right?</p>
<p t="817120" d="3160">The founders, obviously, still held slaves, many of them.</p>
<p t="820380" d="2720">But their principles were not in favor of slavery.</p>
<p t="823100" d="4980">So the principles that they espoused were based on, again, these two competing poles</p>
<p t="828080" d="4900">that are constantly in tension with one another in this sort of Leo Strauss-ian tension with one another.</p>
<p t="832980" d="4820">Between reason and revelation, the Judeo-Christian tradition and the Greek tradition of reason.</p>
<p t="837880" d="5160">And the tug and back and forth is what allows you to have one foot in right and one foot in duties.</p>
<p t="844660" d="3680">So it&#39;d be really good to have a lengthy conversation about this at some point,</p>
<p t="848340" d="3740">because there&#39;s some things in here that really have to be dealt in deeply.</p>
<p t="852240" d="8620">The &quot;you have to find your own purpose&quot; argument was one that was put forth very strongly by Nietzsche after he announced the death of God.</p>
<p t="860860" d="5680">He said that people would have to revalue good and evil and to come up with their own definitions of what constituted morality.</p>
<p t="867100" d="6320">The Nietzschian criticism of Christianity is about as deep as it got, with the possible exception of Dostoyevsky.</p>
<p t="873700" d="7540">But there&#39;s one of the things I really liked about Carl Jung, and that&#39;s really struck me as irrefutable, is</p>
<p t="881680" d="4320">Jung&#39;s fundamental response to Nietzsche was that, well,</p>
<p t="886540" d="3640">let&#39;s take the argument of the death of God to its logical conclusion.</p>
<p t="890180" d="6160">And then let&#39;s investigate the idea that human beings have to be the creators of their own systems of meaning.</p>
<p t="896420" d="6500">Jung&#39;s idea, and this was also the case for the other psychoanalysts, was that&#39;s just palpably false</p>
<p t="902960" d="4550">Because it turns out that you&#39;re not the sort of creature that can create your own meaning.</p>
<p t="907510" d="4619">You&#39;re the sort of creature that has to discover the meaning that already exists encoded within you.</p>
<p t="912460" d="2640">And part of that is that you&#39;re not your own slave.</p>
<p t="915540" d="5780">And so it&#39;s a critique, not only of the idea that you can will your own destiny in its entirety,</p>
<p t="921320" d="2140">while completely ignoring the fact that you have a nature.</p>
<p t="923460" d="6960">But it&#39;s also a profound critique of the socialist utopian ideas that human beings can be molded in any way that they see fit.</p>
<p t="930420" d="3160">And so Jung&#39;s objection was something like,</p>
<p t="933880" d="3420">well, try to generate a meaning on your own, out of nothing.</p>
<p t="937300" d="4360">And then try to force yourself to follow it and see how far you get.</p>
<p t="941660" d="2460">What you&#39;ll find is that you rebel.</p>
<p t="944120" d="2820">Your own nature rebels in every possible way</p>
<p t="946940" d="6860">against the arbitrary imposition of a certain--of just any old moral framework on the manner in which you&#39;re going to conduct yourself.</p>
<p t="955380" d="2160">Yeah, I think this is such a deep critique.</p>
<p t="957660" d="3400">And I think that it&#39;s so telling because what we&#39;ve come up with is,</p>
<p t="961060" d="2220">the substitute for what you&#39;re talking about,</p>
<p t="963280" d="4880">which is this acknowledgement that there is a universal purpose that we ought to be aspiring to discover.</p>
<p t="968160" d="940">That it&#39;s actually out there.</p>
<p t="969100" d="3860">There&#39;s a purpose out there, and it&#39;s our job to uncover it, as opposed to self creating it.</p>
<p t="973000" d="6180">Then that is a really deep divide in America, I think in the West generally, because what people have said is,</p>
<p t="979180" d="2420">okay, we finally realized that we do need this thing called purpose, right?</p>
<p t="981600" d="2720">We can&#39;t just be hedonists all the time. Drugs and sex aren&#39;t going to cut it.</p>
<p t="984320" d="2400">We&#39;re actually gonna need to come up with some purpose...</p>
<p t="986720" d="940">Yeah, they&#39;re hydrous.</p>
<p t="987860" d="3040">Right, but we&#39;re not going to be able to, but at the same time</p>
<p t="990900" d="7680">we don&#39;t want a government or a society or a church or a community forcing down its universal perception of values on us.</p>
<p t="998580" d="4280">And so therefore, our our happy medium is going to be you define your own freedom.</p>
<p t="1002860" d="3680">You define your own rights. And you define your own view of the universe.</p>
<p t="1006540" d="5360">Well that is always going to just evolve into this pathetic sort of solipsism</p>
<p t="1011920" d="3720">that can never be escaped from and doesn&#39;t provide happiness anyway.</p>
<p t="1015640" d="5080">I mean, the people who quote-unquote define their own meaning are some of the least happy people that you will ever meet, because</p>
<p t="1020720" d="2720">they don&#39;t believe that they&#39;re in consonance with anything larger.</p>
<p t="1023440" d="1480">If you&#39;re looking into your self,</p>
<p t="1024920" d="810">your self is not that big.</p>
<p t="1025730" d="950">There&#39;s not that much there, right?</p>
<p t="1026680" d="5180">There has to be something beyond you, whether you find it in God or whether you find it in a community or in nature.</p>
<p t="1031860" d="6060">There has to be something that speaks to you beyond the guts that exist inside you, or you&#39;re just examining your own intestines.</p>
<p t="1037920" d="6440">I think too that you can make a strong scientific case, and this is something I never got to in my discussions with Sam Harris,</p>
<p t="1044360" d="5840">is you could make a strong scientific case for the reality of meaning as an...</p>
<p t="1051160" d="2840">let&#39;s just call it for the reality of meaning.</p>
<p t="1054000" d="2380">You might think about it as a psychological reality,</p>
<p t="1056380" d="3520">but you can think about it as a metaphysical or a biological reality too.</p>
<p t="1059900" d="4540">Because as far as I can tell, and there&#39;s good neurological evidence for this,</p>
<p t="1064440" d="2980">your brain is adapted to two modes of being.</p>
<p t="1067710" d="4400">And one mode of being is that mode that obtains when you&#39;re where you know what you&#39;re doing</p>
<p t="1072110" d="1330">and you know what&#39;s going on.</p>
<p t="1073440" d="2400">So you could call that explored territory, let&#39;s say.</p>
<p t="1075840" d="5960">And there&#39;s another mode of being that is that which obtains when you don&#39;t know what&#39;s going on.</p>
<p t="1081800" d="1480">When you&#39;re in unexplored territory.</p>
<p t="1083360" d="5960">You can say, well, animals since the beginning of time have adapted to some combination of exploring an unexplored territory.</p>
<p t="1089320" d="5620">And that&#39;s roughly akin to known and unknown, which I think is what&#39;s symbolized in the yin-yang symbols.</p>
<p t="1094940" d="6720">And as far as I can tell, the sense of meaning that people experience that&#39;s spontaneous and deep</p>
<p t="1101660" d="8120">is an indication that they&#39;re functioning well in exploring territory, but simultaneously Increasing their capacity to deal with unexplored territory.</p>
<p t="1109820" d="5700">So it&#39;s like the zone of proximal development, or even the flow states that Csikszentmihalyi has talked about.</p>
<p t="1115520" d="5280">But see, the best thing to be is where things are going well for you.</p>
<p t="1120800" d="4980">But also where you&#39;re expanding the capacity of things to go well for you simultaneously.</p>
<p t="1125780" d="3680">And then you can add to that the fact that that&#39;s not going to be solipsistic.</p>
<p t="1129460" d="1880">Because we live in a social world.</p>
<p t="1131340" d="7300">If I&#39;m pursuing something that&#39;s deeply meaningful, then what if things are constructed fortunately?</p>
<p t="1138640" d="7960">Then I&#39;m going to be pursuing something that&#39;s very good for me now and me later and me deep in the future at the same time</p>
<p t="1146600" d="4320">I&#39;m pursuing something that&#39;s good for you now, and you later and you deep into the future.</p>
<p t="1151140" d="1640">And I believe that sense of</p>
<p t="1153180" d="7020">deep engagement that envelops people in fortunate periods of their lives is actually a neurological signal that</p>
<p t="1160200" d="5180">the layers of being are stacked on top of one another properly and that you&#39;re oriented</p>
<p t="1165840" d="2740">properly within them and that it&#39;s...</p>
<p t="1168660" d="4920">See, to me, I&#39;ve often thought that the most real thing is pain.</p>
<p t="1173580" d="1760">And then you might say, well,</p>
<p t="1175340" d="4780">If there&#39;s an antidote to pain, that would be something that would be even more real than pain.</p>
<p t="1180120" d="3320">And it seems to me that the sense of meaning that I&#39;m talking about here,</p>
<p t="1183440" d="7200">that&#39;s associated with this sense of ultimate responsibility is an antidote to pain and therefore is something that&#39;s most real.</p>
<p t="1190720" d="4620">I don&#39;t see anything- you can make a metaphysical claim about that and that&#39;s perfectly reasonable.</p>
<p t="1195340" d="4260">But you don&#39;t have to. You can make a bloody hardcore scientific claim for that.</p>
<p t="1199600" d="2280">And I think it&#39;s extremely difficult to refute.</p>
<p t="1204720" d="949">I tend to agree with that.</p>
<p t="1205669" d="3930">And I think that you referencing the flow state, that&#39;s something that the...</p>
<p t="1209880" d="3440">where we are happiest, right, from from scientific research, is in that flow state.</p>
<p t="1213320" d="3060">And that flow state Is exactly what we&#39;re talking about now.</p>
<p t="1216380" d="4620">This feeling that you have mastery over your capacity to explore the unexplored.</p>
<p t="1221000" d="2360">And that the unexplored is worth is worth exploring, right?</p>
<p t="1223360" d="4460">I mean, that&#39;s the other thing, is that what drives you to to explore the unexplored?</p>
<p t="1227820" d="4240">It&#39;s not just that you get up in the morning and you feel like wandering outside into the forest.</p>
<p t="1232160" d="560">There&#39;s some of that.</p>
<p t="1232720" d="3580">But I think some of it is that you feel like there&#39;s an actual necessity for you as a human being to do that.</p>
<p t="1236300" d="2620">There&#39;s a moral duty for you to try and conquer new worlds.</p>
<p t="1239200" d="3680">And adding the moral layer, the moral impetus on top of,</p>
<p t="1242880" d="5840">I just have a decision to go out and explore unexplored territory is what I think</p>
<p t="1248720" d="3320">allows civilization to create rather than destroy.</p>
<p t="1252040" d="3780">And I&#39;ve talked a lot on my show about male toxicity.</p>
<p t="1255820" d="2360">You know, what people call &quot;toxic masculinity&quot; and all this nonsense.</p>
<p t="1258220" d="500">Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p t="1258720" d="6740">And the binary nature, I think, of human beings, particularly men, is that men,</p>
<p t="1265460" d="5120">because I have a little boy who&#39;s a year and a half old, and he&#39;s either he&#39;s either building a stack of blocks or he&#39;s destroying the stack of blocks.</p>
<p t="1270640" d="4080">There is no in-between and so if you&#39;re exploring unexplored territory,</p>
<p t="1274730" d="4470">They&#39;re only two ways to deal with that one is to actually take a fire and set it in the unexplored territory or the other</p>
<p t="1279200" d="4500">Is to cultivate that unexplored territory and adding that moral layer of it&#39;s your job</p>
<p t="1284280" d="6829">to forge out into the universe and make that cultivated territory, to bring that into the known that adding that moral dimension is I think</p>
<p t="1291510" d="2000">what both the Greeks and</p>
<p t="1293910" d="2239">Judeo-Christian tradition are about and I think it&#39;s more</p>
<p t="1297030" d="5690">Christian but the idea that there is a God worth exploring and that God has reached down to man and uplifted him is is I</p>
<p t="1302720" d="2609">think relevant to Judeo-Christian religion</p>
<p t="1305330" d="2699">And is really the essence of Judeo-Christian religion.  Iif you look at polytheism</p>
<p t="1308490" d="2750">That notion that you&#39;re out there to try and understand God</p>
<p t="1311240" d="4470">It doesn&#39;t it doesn&#39;t exist in polytheistic religion the notion that you&#39;re supposed to look beyond</p>
<p t="1315960" d="3469">Your you&#39;re supposed to look beyond yourself to a broader understanding of the universe</p>
<p t="1319430" d="420">No</p>
<p t="1319850" d="5219">You were subject to forces in the universe right and those were represented by the different gods not this idea that there&#39;s a universal system</p>
<p t="1325070" d="6270">That&#39;s that&#39;s at least partially knowable that if you spend your life trying to investigate and live in consonance with you will be happier</p>
<p t="1331340" d="1510">That&#39;s a lot closer to the Greek system</p>
<p t="1332850" d="4530">Which is why you ends up with this common idea of the Logos that you talk about being in the book of John.</p>
<p t="1337400" d="3780">But also really springing from from Greek thought. I mean that&#39;s that&#39;s that&#39;s the idea there. Right, right.</p>
<p t="1341920" d="2880">Yes an unbelievably brilliant synthesis. No you-you-you</p>
<p t="1345360" d="2000">touched on the idea of cultivation</p>
<p t="1347360" d="1529">So I wanted to ask you about that</p>
<p t="1348889" d="6000">I&#39;m going to Amsterdam to talk to you this event at this event sponsored by a group called the Dutch lion</p>
<p t="1354889" d="2550">And that&#39;s going to happen January 19th</p>
<p t="1357440" d="5880">and we&#39;ve got about 2,000 people attending this event and it&#39;s going to be a national discussion about</p>
<p t="1363900" d="2700">Dutch and European identity and immigration and</p>
<p t="1366780" d="6680">So in principle it could be a big deal and one of the things I&#39;ve been meditating on is what it is that</p>
<p t="1373460" d="2640">Western civilization got right and</p>
<p t="1376169" d="5449">so the first thing I think is that we got the idea of the Logos right that&#39;s a big deal the sovereignty of the</p>
<p t="1381779" d="4790">individual and the sovereignty and the necessity for respect of the capacity of the</p>
<p t="1387389" d="7820">Exploring individual to conquer new territory and make it habitable.  We got that right and so and I mean fundamentally right, but then</p>
<p t="1395730" d="6199">That seems also to me to tie interestingly into the idea of property rights because the fundamental Marxist claim</p>
<p t="1402240" d="980">There&#39;s a number of them</p>
<p t="1403220" d="1209">but one of the most fundamental</p>
<p t="1404429" d="960">claims is that</p>
<p t="1405389" d="6200">property is in some sense theft and so that might even mean the property that you accrued as a consequence of being successful</p>
<p t="1411690" d="6949">and I think it might be worth giving the devil his due and say well are there conditions under which my</p>
<p t="1419549" d="7579">occupation of a space to the exclusion of you isn&#39;t merely theft and the idea of cultivation I think is exactly the right</p>
<p t="1427320" d="709">Answer to that</p>
<p t="1428029" d="5130">Is that the point is for each of us to allow the other to</p>
<p t="1433499" d="2060">occupy a particular place and time</p>
<p t="1435809" d="4670">In the hopes that we&#39;ll each take care of it for our own benefit and for the benefit of others</p>
<p t="1440480" d="2339">And then what happens is that everyone wins</p>
<p t="1443820" d="2869">Yeah, and this is a very obviously Lockean idea, right?</p>
<p t="1446690" d="4920">This is this is Locke&#39;s idea of what makes property worthwhile and property rights worth well as you mix your labor with the land and</p>
<p t="1451610" d="779">You cultivated it</p>
<p t="1452389" d="5040">Which is why Locke specifically talks about the notion of adverse possession right if I own a piece of property?</p>
<p t="1457429" d="2010">And I just decided to leave it trashed</p>
<p t="1459990" d="3409">Somewhere and then someone comes in and cultivates the property even though I own the property</p>
<p t="1463399" d="5099">I should have a good legal case to actually make against that owner because I&#39;m not cultivating the property the idea being that</p>
<p t="1468690" d="4550">Cultivation and use of the land is actually your individual duty. It&#39;s your individual duty</p>
<p t="1473240" d="1080">There&#39;s also your communal duty</p>
<p t="1474320" d="7330">So I think the moral legitimacy of property rights is you know in in Locke&#39;s thought particularly is very much tied to</p>
<p t="1482080" d="5989">Cultivation and your personal stake in what you&#39;ve done with with the property that you own again</p>
<p t="1488070" d="4980">It&#39;s exactly your point that there&#39;s a mix of rights to these property rights our linkage of duties. It&#39;s not just props go be owned</p>
<p t="1493750" d="1970">Okay, so maybe we can close with this</p>
<p t="1495720" d="3900">You know the the idea of a garden is very interesting to me and of course the natural</p>
<p t="1499900" d="4819">Environment of the human being is the garden according to Genesis right it&#39;s the Garden of Eden</p>
<p t="1504720" d="5969">And I&#39;ve thought for a long time, &quot;Well, Why is it a garden?&quot; And the answer to that is that a garden is the optimal</p>
<p t="1511660" d="3289">Juxtaposition of nature and culture. Right, so a garden is nature</p>
<p t="1515500" d="6500">Blooming of its own accord, but tended very carefully and so then the rule would be something like you&#39;re allowed</p>
<p t="1522130" d="6650">You&#39;re allowed to own something you have the right to own something you have the privilege to own something if what you&#39;re doing is</p>
<p t="1529030" d="2000">Transforming it into a bountiful garden</p>
<p t="1533020" d="3949">Right I think it&#39;s true, and I think that&#39;s true in every area of a successful life</p>
<p t="1536970" d="990">It&#39;s true with how you raise your children</p>
<p t="1537960" d="3600">Yeah, you lose the right to raise your children properly if you&#39;re raising your children improperly</p>
<p t="1541560" d="2519">I think it&#39;s true of marriage marriages break down when you don&#39;t cultivate</p>
<p t="1544810" d="3199">cultivation is the the ultimate human need is cultivation and</p>
<p t="1548230" d="5660">When we cultivate whether it&#39;s in the realm of knowledge or science or whether it&#39;s in the realm of religion and relationships</p>
<p t="1553890" d="4790">then we are happier and when we don&#39;t cultivate and we and when we deprive ourselves of the capacity and</p>
<p t="1559240" d="6780">Both the capacity and the purpose of cultivation, then everything falls into anarchy, then then just through entropy everything will fall apart, I think.</p>
<p t="1566440" d="5260">Ok, ok, so the right objection to &quot;privilege&quot; is cultivation. It&#39;s like. I&#39;m not privileged. I&#39;m cultivating</p>
<p t="1572530" d="2089">I like that. I like that a lot. Yeah well</p>
<p t="1574620" d="5940">It&#39;s necessary to take it to grip these things by the neck you know and so ok, that&#39;s good well look</p>
<p t="1580560" d="1440">Thanks very much for talking to me</p>
<p t="1582000" d="4619">I hope we get a chance to talk again in the relatively near future because there&#39;s some things we could really sort out I think</p>
<p t="1586840" d="3050">That&#39;d be great. I&#39;d really appreciate it and big fan of your work obviously</p>
<p t="1590830" d="1860">Yeah, the feeling&#39;s mutual.</p>
<p t="1592690" d="3680">Thanks so much. Good talking to you. Happy new year, eh? You too.</p>
