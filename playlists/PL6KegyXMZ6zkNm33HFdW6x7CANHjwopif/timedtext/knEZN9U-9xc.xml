<p t="30980" d="2360">One of the </p>
<p t="33350" d="7000">fundamental theses of this course is that
in, in modern literature, and in literature</p>
<p t="41449" d="5801">that isn't so modern, there's the notion
of a human-created monster, Frankenstein,</p>
<p t="47250" d="5000">right, springs to mind, and at an adequate
time, I mean, Frankenstein was a, a fantasy,</p>
<p t="52250" d="6570">an unconscious fantasy, a dream in, in actuality,
about the potential dangers of unbridled technological</p>
<p t="58820" d="7000">advancement, right, Why is that? Well maybe
it's something like this, and, and this</p>
<p t="70330" d="7000">is certainly a, a notion that Jung would agree
with, if we don't develop a moral sense</p>
<p t="79759" d="6051">as conscious and as elaborated as our technological
sense, the fact that we're increasingly</p>
<p t="85810" d="3930">capable of becoming increasingly powerful
will necessarily do us in, right.</p>
<p t="89740" d="7000">The bigger your weapons, the smarter you better
be to control them, and so maybe it is something</p>
<p t="99189" d="5380">like this, maybe, and this is a strict Jungian
notion, maybe five hundred years ago when</p>
<p t="104569" d="6570">we started to ratchet up the rate at which
we were developing our technological expertise,</p>
<p t="111139" d="7000">and left our mythological and religious presuppositions
and conceptions behind as archaic and perhaps</p>
<p t="119539" d="5570">as predicated on superstition , maybe we need
to spend as much time updating them and bringing</p>
<p t="125109" d="4891">them into the domain of clear consciousness
and control as we have spent on developing</p>
<p t="130000" d="6280">our technological sense.</p>
<p t="136280" d="4340">If you were a medieval Christian or an archaic
religious thinker of any sort, your first</p>
<p t="140620" d="4380">presupposition was that the world and the
cosmos existed exactly as they appeared,</p>
<p t="145000" d="6080">which with you or at least your village or
town or country at the center, and certainly</p>
<p t="151080" d="4519">with the earth at the center, and with the
cosmos as a shield around the earth, and with</p>
<p t="155599" d="5401">the earth itself as the domain of man being
a fundamental attribute of the cosmos.</p>
<p t="161000" d="7000">So this is a quotation from Jung, and it's
one I like a lot because I think it adequately</p>
<p t="169760" d="6979">and succinctly describes the distinction between
the way that modern people think, and the</p>
<p t="176739" d="5401">way that people think if they're still ensconced
within a traditional belief form, How totally,</p>
<p t="182140" d="5290">different, did the world appear to medieval
man. For him the earth was eternally fixed</p>
<p t="187430" d="5320">and it rest in the center of the universe
encircled by the course of a sun that solicitously</p>
<p t="192750" d="1849">bestowed its warmth,</p>
<p t="194599" d="5310">Despite the fact that pre-empirical people
had to deal with death and disease on a scale</p>
<p t="199909" d="4571">that I think is completely unknown to us,
it doesn't seem unreasonable to presuppose</p>
<p t="204480" d="130">that</p>
<p t="204610" d="3579">there was a certain degree of comfort to be
found in a worldview of this sort,</p>
<p t="208189" d="4261">right, because it appeared at least to the
casual observer that</p>
<p t="212450" d="3810">the cosmos was human centric,</p>
<p t="216260" d="6240">and that the notion that human purpose was
in some way associated with cosmic significance,</p>
<p t="222500" d="5409">seemed to be beyond question, at least in
part because there were no theories of reality</p>
<p t="227909" d="3310">that would compete with that initial preconception.</p>
<p t="231219" d="4220">Men were all children of God unto the loving
care of the most High, who prepared them for</p>
<p t="235439" d="4241">eternal blessedness, and all knew exactly
what they should do and how they should conduct</p>
<p t="239680" d="7000">themselves in order to rise from a corruptible
world to an incorruptible and joyous existence.</p>
<p t="246959" d="6211">Such a life no longer seems real to us, even
in our dreams. Natural science has long ago</p>
<p t="253170" d="2970">torn this lovely veil to shreds.</p>
<p t="256140" d="2379">how is it that people could think that way</p>
<p t="258519" d="3030">given that it was so wrong and still survive?</p>
<p t="261549" d="4581">Given that in large part we are necessarily
creatures of tradition.</p>
<p t="266130" d="7000">How is it that we can sever the ties with
the manner in which our ancestors thought,</p>
<p t="274190" d="3840">and suffer no ill consequences in result?</p>
<p t="278030" d="3940">People think automatically, and, and I think
for good reasons, that</p>
<p t="281970" d="5930">the march of human thought has been unbroken
progress towards increased rationality,</p>
<p t="287900" d="4250">increased power, increased clarity, but it's
certainly the case that as a consequence of</p>
<p t="292150" d="2040">sacrifice of our religious beliefs</p>
<p t="294190" d="4800">and our philosophical beliefs that problems
of meaning have become more paramount for</p>
<p t="298990" d="940">the modern person.</p>
<p t="299930" d="3389">And then you might ask, well what exactly
are the consequences of that,</p>
<p t="303319" d="5931">and I think initially the best perspective
to take is one that's historical.</p>
<p t="309250" d="7000">As we've moved away from a classical, mystical
or mythological worldview,</p>
<p t="316520" d="4019">a number of dramatic occurrences have unfolded,</p>
<p t="320539" d="3651">we've become much more technologically powerful,
right.</p>
<p t="324190" d="4990">The application of a strict empirical model
designed to abstract out from everyone's</p>
<p t="329180" d="820">experience,</p>
<p t="330000" d="6160">those things that are material and constant
have enabled us to produce</p>
<p t="336160" d="4770">technological implements of extreme power,
right, both for good, at least in principle</p>
<p t="340930" d="1639">with regards to medical advances,</p>
<p t="342569" d="6021">and also for ill, in terms of our ability
to control weapons of unbelievable destructive</p>
<p t="348590" d="560">force.</p>
<p t="349150" d="5710">So we're more powerful. Are we any smarter
or any wiser?</p>
<p t="354860" d="4600">Well I think a casual glance at the history
of the 20th Century would suggest that perhaps</p>
<p t="359460" d="489">we're not.</p>
<p t="359949" d="3881">I don't think there's any indication whatsoever,
although perhaps things have improved in the</p>
<p t="363830" d="1809">last fifteen years,</p>
<p t="365639" d="6710">that an additional consequence of our capacity
to extract ourselves from our religious modes</p>
<p t="372349" d="790">of thought</p>
<p t="373139" d="4471">has been a palpable increase in wisdom or
tolerance or compassion,</p>
<p t="377610" d="4660">or a palpable increase in our ability to understand
explicitly what might constitute the basis</p>
<p t="382270" d="5720">for a suitable and stable state.</p>
<p t="387990" d="4730">So you might take, for example, the fact that
the 20th Century has been unbelievably bloody,</p>
<p t="392720" d="5620">right, literally hundreds of millions of people
killed in conflicts of one form or another,</p>
<p t="398340" d="3789">both external, say, in the course of World
War II or Vietnam,</p>
<p t="402129" d="4111">and internal, in the case of Nazi Germany
or the Soviet Union,</p>
<p t="406240" d="5579">or any of the vast array of countries who
subjected their citizens to terrible internal</p>
<p t="411819" d="871">repression</p>
<p t="412690" d="2659">in the name of the maintenance of order.</p>
<p t="415349" d="2570">I mentioned that Alexander Solzhenitzyn estimated
that</p>
<p t="417919" d="4691">sixty million people died in the Soviet Union
between 1919 and 1959</p>
<p t="422610" d="2959">as a consequence of internal repression,</p>
<p t="425569" d="4250">and his estimates were that perhaps twice
that many died during the Cultural Revolution</p>
<p t="429819" d="4081">in China.</p>
<p t="433900" d="6609">Looking back on the 20th Century, one seem,
one thing seems relatively clear, right.</p>
<p t="440509" d="7000">Although humanity as a whole has ceased, or
had ceased at least to engage in large scale</p>
<p t="449690" d="1360">religious conflicts,</p>
<p t="451050" d="6700">although they seem to have been making a vicious
comeback in the last five years,</p>
<p t="457750" d="6849">our ability to live together still seems incredibly
compromised by our capacity to engage in ideological</p>
<p t="464599" d="1081">conflict, right,</p>
<p t="465680" d="7000">and it doesn't seem to me ridiculous to
presume that the battles between capitalism</p>
<p t="472819" d="1371">and communism, say,</p>
<p t="474190" d="2830">or between capitalism, communism and fascism</p>
<p t="477020" d="6340">, or even the emergent struggle between fundamentalist
Islam and the West,</p>
<p t="483360" d="4190">can necessarily be regarded as anything but
extensions of our tendency towards religious</p>
<p t="487550" d="1899">and mythological conflict,</p>
<p t="489449" d="5210">even though, in principle, systems like communism
and fascism were not predicated on explicitly</p>
<p t="494659" d="2771">religious presuppositions.</p>
<p t="497430" d="7000">Well it seems to me that a logical conclusion
from observations of that sort</p>
<p t="506599" d="5301">is that even if you eradicate the traditional
trappings of the mythological worldview,</p>
<p t="511900" d="4259">which seems to be what's happened as a consequence
of our rise in empirical knowledge,</p>
<p t="516159" d="5510">that you don't eradicate the tendency for
people to formulate groups, belief systems</p>
<p t="521669" d="6561">, around conceptions of ways that you should
behave</p>
<p t="528230" d="4140">that are, at the very least, religious in
structure and action, even if they're not</p>
<p t="532370" d="890">religious in name;</p>
<p t="533260" d="3670">I mean I think it's a very peculiar coincidence,
for example,</p>
<p t="536930" d="4480">that the Soviet Communists erected at Male
Trinity</p>
<p t="541410" d="7000">Marx, Lenin and Stalin as an apparent replacement
for the masculine trinity</p>
<p t="548870" d="6810">that comprised the essential deities of Orthodox,
Russian Orthodox Christianity.</p>
<p t="555680" d="2719">Why would these forms re-emerge so spontaneously,</p>
<p t="558399" d="5651">and what does it mean that people who regard
themselves as essentially modern and empirical</p>
<p t="564050" d="7000">in their presuppositions seem to be absolutely
susceptible in their fundament to ideological</p>
<p t="571430" d="1680">claims?</p>
<p t="573110" d="3030">Well if you look at the Soviet Union, which
I think is a very instructive case</p>
<p t="576140" d="6780">because the Soviets, the Russians, were really
the last European power to fall prey to the</p>
<p t="582920" d="609">conflict</p>
<p t="583529" d="3490">between empiricism and science and religion,</p>
<p t="587019" d="3171">and they didn't really fall prey to that
until the mid 1800's</p>
<p t="590190" d="4630">because Russia was a relatively closed society,
relatively illiterate,</p>
<p t="594820" d="6120">maintaining a medieval structure far past
the time when other European countries had</p>
<p t="600940" d="1680">abandoned that.</p>
<p t="602620" d="4409">In the 1850's, a wave of atheism spread
across Russia,</p>
<p t="607029" d="5581">in some sense as a wave of enlightenment,
but also as a plague,</p>
<p t="612610" d="7000">and figures as powering as Tolstoy</p>
<p t="620420" d="4880">remembered in his memoirs the very day that
he realized</p>
<p t="625300" d="6310">that the empirical discoveries of Western
Europeans had eradicated his ability to believe</p>
<p t="631610" d="1820">in the Russian Orthodox system.</p>
<p t="633430" d="3800">You lose something like that, what happens?</p>
<p t="637230" d="6250">Well if you believe that mythological thinking
is nothing but superstitious empiricism</p>
<p t="643480" d="4159">and that it's been replaced entirely by
a more appropriate modern view, then nothing</p>
<p t="647639" d="481">happens, right,</p>
<p t="648120" d="4610">it's all to your benefit to become enlightened,
but if you believe that there's more to</p>
<p t="652730" d="1130">the story than that,</p>
<p t="653860" d="6180">and that more traditional, ethical and moral
systems predicated on mythological presuppositions</p>
<p t="660040" d="4400">offer you a map of how to behave and what
to think and how to regulate your emotions</p>
<p t="664440" d="1280">and what to strive for,</p>
<p t="665720" d="5309">none of which can be replaced by a scientific
perspective, then the eradication of a system</p>
<p t="671029" d="1731">like that leaves a vacuum,</p>
<p t="672760" d="3579">and then the question is, what rushes in to
fill a vacuum?</p>
<p t="676339" d="3381">Well if you look at the case of the Soviet
Union, it seems quite instructive, doesn't</p>
<p t="679720" d="309">it.</p>
<p t="680029" d="5211">I mean, there's a thirty-year period where
there's tremendous intellectual clash,</p>
<p t="685240" d="7000">say between a materialist, an empirical perspective,
and in Russian Orthodox perspective.</p>
<p t="693110" d="5349">The Russian Orthodox perspective loses its
attractiveness for the reigning intellectual</p>
<p t="698459" d="870">elite</p>
<p t="699329" d="4211">and the presuppositions of communism which
appear rational by contrast,</p>
<p t="703540" d="4609">but which, by all evidence, were not, rush
in to fill the gap, and</p>
<p t="708149" d="4401">I want to read you something that Nietzsche
wrote, it's perhaps the most famous thing</p>
<p t="712550" d="1330">he ever said,</p>
<p t="713880" d="4009">although it's almost entirely taken out
of context and misquoted, and if not misquoted,</p>
<p t="717889" d="1700">at least misunderstood,</p>
<p t="719589" d="4310">because Nietzsche was one of these strange
people who was capable of living 50 or even</p>
<p t="723899" d="1711">100 years into the future,</p>
<p t="725610" d="5550">and although he was, is, generally regarded
as an enemy of Christianity and superstition,</p>
<p t="731160" d="3979">and was certainly an unbelievably outspoken
of Christian… opponent of Christian traditionalism,</p>
<p t="735139" d="6221">How similar. Don't know exactly how similar
but that's what stories tell you how similar.</p>
<p t="741360" d="7000">One of the fundamental theses of this course
is that in, in modern literature, and in literature</p>
<p t="749040" d="4729">that isn't so modern, there's the notion
of a human-created monster, Frankenstein,</p>
<p t="753769" d="4380">right, springs to mind, and at an adequate
time, I mean, Frankenstein was a, a fantasy,</p>
<p t="758149" d="4701">an unconscious fantasy, a dream in, in actuality,
about the potential dangers of unbridled technological</p>
<p t="762850" d="6330">advancement, right, Why is that? Well maybe
it's something like this, and, and this</p>
<p t="769180" d="4120">is certainly a, a notion that Jung would agree
with, if we don't develop a moral sense</p>
<p t="773300" d="4599">as conscious and as elaborated as our technological
sense, the fact that we're increasingly</p>
<p t="777899" d="2971">capable of becoming increasingly powerful
will necessarily do us in, right.</p>

<p t="1003850" d="3270">and also for ill, in terms of our ability
to control weapons of unbelievable destructive</p>
<p t="1007120" d="269">force.</p>
<p t="1007389" d="3041">So we're more powerful. Are we any smarter
or any wiser?</p>
<p t="1010430" d="5560">Well I think a casual glance at the history
of the 20th Century would suggest that perhaps</p>
<p t="1015990" d="719">we're not.</p>
<p t="1016709" d="3880">I don't think there's any indication whatsoever,
although perhaps things have improved in the</p>
<p t="1020589" d="601">last fifteen years,</p>
<p t="1021190" d="5220">that an additional consequence of our capacity
to extract ourselves from our religious modes</p>
<p t="1026410" d="850">of thought</p>
<p t="1027260" d="7000">has been a palpable increase in wisdom or
tolerance or compassion,</p>
<p t="1035260" d="4020">or a palpable increase in our ability to understand
explicitly what might constitute the basis</p>
<p t="1039280" d="5320">for a suitable and stable state.</p>
<p t="1044600" d="5470">So you might take, for example, the fact that
the 20th Century has been unbelievably bloody,</p>
<p t="1050070" d="4670">right, literally hundreds of millions of people
killed in conflicts of one form or another,</p>
<p t="1054740" d="3740">both external, say, in the course of World
War II or Vietnam,</p>
<p t="1058480" d="5410">and internal, in the case of Nazi Germany
or the Soviet Union,</p>
<p t="1063890" d="7000">or any of the vast array of countries who
subjected their citizens to terrible internal</p>
<p t="1072710" d="700">repression</p>
<p t="1073410" d="7000">in the name of the maintenance of order.</p>
<p t="1080930" d="7000">I mentioned that Alexander Solzhenitzyn estimated
that</p>
<p t="1089820" d="5690">sixty million people died in the Soviet Union
between 1919 and 1959</p>
<p t="1095510" d="1870">as a consequence of internal repression,</p>
<p t="1097380" d="7000">and his estimates were that perhaps twice
that many died during the Cultural Revolution</p>
<p t="1111000" d="960">in China.</p>
<p t="1111960" d="7000">Looking back on the 20th Century, one seem,
one thing seems relatively clear, right.</p>
<p t="1119340" d="7000">Although humanity as a whole has ceased, or
had ceased at least to engage in large scale</p>
<p t="1126980" d="2180">religious conflicts,</p>
<p t="1129160" d="7000">although they seem to have been making a vicious
comeback in the last five years,</p>
<p t="1143650" d="7000">our ability to live together still seems incredibly
compromised by our capacity to engage in ideological</p>
<p t="1157100" d="600">conflict, right,</p>
<p t="1157700" d="4340">and it doesn't seem to me ridiculous to
presume that the battles between capitalism</p>
<p t="1162040" d="400">and communism, say,</p>
<p t="1162440" d="1090">or between capitalism, communism and fascism</p>
<p t="1163530" d="2970">, or even the emergent struggle between fundamentalist
Islam and the West,</p>
<p t="1166500" d="5000">can necessarily be regarded as anything but
extensions of our tendency towards religious</p>
<p t="1171500" d="1320">and mythological conflict,</p>
<p t="1172820" d="6160">even though, in principle, systems like communism
and fascism were not predicated on explicitly</p>
<p t="1178980" d="880">religious presuppositions.</p>
<p t="1179860" d="6990">Well it seems to me that a logical conclusion
from observations of that sort</p>
<p t="1186850" d="6260">is that even if you eradicate the traditional
trappings of the mythological worldview,</p>
<p t="1193110" d="7000">which seems to be what's happened as a consequence
of our rise in empirical knowledge,</p>
<p t="1200210" d="7000">that you don't eradicate the tendency for
people to formulate groups, belief systems</p>
<p t="1209780" d="3820">, around conceptions of ways that you should
behave</p>
<p t="1213600" d="6540">that are, at the very least, religious in
structure and action, even if they're not</p>
<p t="1220140" d="1300">religious in name;</p>
<p t="1221440" d="4170">I mean I think it's a very peculiar coincidence,
for example,</p>
<p t="1225610" d="3060">that the Soviet Communists erected at Male
Trinity</p>
<p t="1228670" d="4970">Marx, Lenin and Stalin as an apparent replacement
for the masculine trinity</p>
<p t="1233640" d="3490">that comprised the essential deities of Orthodox,
Russian Orthodox Christianity.</p>
<p t="1237130" d="2910">Why would these forms re-emerge so spontaneously,</p>
<p t="1240040" d="5700">and what does it mean that people who regard
themselves as essentially modern and empirical</p>
<p t="1245740" d="5030">in their presuppositions seem to be absolutely
susceptible in their fundament to ideological</p>
<p t="1250770" d="380">claims?</p>
<p t="1251150" d="7000">Well if you look at the Soviet Union, which
I think is a very instructive case</p>
<p t="1261690" d="5830">because the Soviets, the Russians, were really
the last European power to fall prey to the</p>
<p t="1267520" d="370">conflict</p>
<p t="1267890" d="2530">between empiricism and science and religion,</p>
<p t="1270420" d="3710">and they didn't really fall prey to that
until the mid 1800's</p>
<p t="1274130" d="3250">because Russia was a relatively closed society,
relatively illiterate,</p>
<p t="1277380" d="4620">maintaining a medieval structure far past
the time when other European countries had</p>
<p t="1282000" d="690">abandoned that.</p>
<p t="1282690" d="3970">In the 1850's, a wave of atheism spread
across Russia,</p>
<p t="1286660" d="4670">in some sense as a wave of enlightenment,
but also as a plague,</p>
<p t="1291330" d="1310">and figures as powering as Tolstoy</p>
<p t="1292640" d="1210">remembered in his memoirs the very day that
he realized</p>
<p t="1293850" d="5280">that the empirical discoveries of Western
Europeans had eradicated his ability to believe</p>
<p t="1299130" d="2320">in the Russian Orthodox system.</p>
<p t="1301450" d="3260">You lose something like that, what happens?</p>
<p t="1304710" d="3820">Well if you believe that mythological thinking
is nothing but superstitious empiricism</p>
<p t="1308530" d="4140">and that it's been replaced entirely by
a more appropriate modern view, then nothing</p>
<p t="1312670" d="590">happens, right,</p>
<p t="1313260" d="6320">it's all to your benefit to become enlightened,
but if you believe that there's more to</p>
<p t="1319580" d="2730">the story than that,</p>
<p t="1322310" d="3780">and that more traditional, ethical and moral
systems predicated on mythological presuppositions</p>
<p t="1326090" d="5150">offer you a map of how to behave and what
to think and how to regulate your emotions</p>
<p t="1331240" d="1490">and what to strive for,</p>
<p t="1332730" d="7000">none of which can be replaced by a scientific
perspective, then the eradication of a system</p>
<p t="1340050" d="970">like that leaves a vacuum,</p>
<p t="1341020" d="2860">and then the question is, what rushes in to
fill a vacuum?</p>
<p t="1343880" d="7000">Well if you look at the case of the Soviet
Union, it seems quite instructive, doesn't</p>
<p t="1353070" d="450">it.</p>
<p t="1353520" d="4990">I mean, there's a thirty-year period where
there's tremendous intellectual clash,</p>
<p t="1358510" d="5440">say between a materialist, an empirical perspective,
and in Russian Orthodox perspective.</p>
<p t="1363950" d="4480">The Russian Orthodox perspective loses its
attractiveness for the reigning intellectual</p>
<p t="1368430" d="470">elite</p>
<p t="1368900" d="3320">and the presuppositions of communism which
appear rational by contrast,</p>
<p t="1372220" d="4970">but which, by all evidence, were not, rush
in to fill the gap, and</p>
<p t="1377190" d="6080">I want to read you something that Nietzsche
wrote, it's perhaps the most famous thing</p>
<p t="1383270" d="2030">he ever said,</p>
<p t="1385300" d="7000">although it's almost entirely taken out
of context and misquoted, and if not misquoted,</p>
<p t="1393430" d="1710">at least misunderstood,</p>
<p t="1395140" d="7000">because Nietzsche was one of these strange
people who was capable of living 50 or even</p>
<p t="1403770" d="2800">100 years into the future,</p>
<p t="1406570" d="7000">and although he was, is, generally regarded
as an enemy of Christianity and superstition,</p>
<p t="1414410" d="6540">and was certainly an unbelievably outspoken
of Christian… opponent of Christian traditionalism,</p>
<p t="1420950" d="5580">he also knew that if you let the old Gods
die,</p>
<p t="1426530" d="5290">the probability that blood would flood the
land was virtually 100%,</p>
<p t="1431820" d="7000">so let me read you what he wrote with respect
to precisely this point:</p>
<p t="1438960" d="7000">Have you not heard of that mad man who lit
a lantern in the bright morning hours, ran</p>
<p t="1447940" d="7000">to the marketplace and cried incessantly,
I seek God. As many of those who do not believe</p>
<p t="1456500" d="670">in God were standing around just then, he
provoked must, much laughter. Why, did he</p>
<p t="1457170" d="650">get lost, said one. Did he lose his way like
a child, said another, or is he hiding, is</p>
<p t="1457820" d="730">he afraid of us, is he going on a voyage or
emigrated, thus they yelled and laughed. The</p>
<p t="1458550" d="1670">mad man jumped into their midst and pierced
them with his glances. Wither is God, he cried,</p>
<p t="1460220" d="5870">I shall tell you. We have killed him, you
and I. All of us are his murderers. But how</p>
<p t="1466090" d="4500">have we done this, how were we able to drink
up the sea, who gave us the sponge to wipe</p>
<p t="1470590" d="2470">away the entire horizon, what did we do when
we unchanged this earth from its sun? Wither</p>
<p t="1473060" d="620">is it moving now? Wither are we moving now?
Away from all suns? Are we not plunging continuously</p>
<p t="1473680" d="580">backwards, sideward, forward, in all directions?
Is there any up or down left? Are we not straying</p>
<p t="1474260" d="550">as though through an infinite nothing, did
we not feel the breath of empty space, has</p>
<p t="1474810" d="720">it not become colder, is not night and more
night coming on all the while, must not lanterns</p>
<p t="1475530" d="1700">be lit in the morning, do we not hear anything
yet of the noise of the grave diggers who</p>
<p t="1477230" d="1400">are burying God, do we not smell anything
yet of God's decomposition? Gods, too, decompose.</p>
<p t="1478630" d="3210">God is dead, God remains dead, and we have
killed him. How shall we, the murderer of</p>
<p t="1481840" d="4720">all murderers, comfort ourselves? What was
holiest and most powerful of all that the</p>
<p t="1486560" d="4720">world has yet owned has bled to death under
our knives. Who will wipe this blood off us?</p>
<p t="1491280" d="1640">What water is there for us to clean ourselves,
what festivals of atonement, what sacred game</p>
<p t="1492920" d="690">shall we have to invent? Is not the greatness
of this deed too great for us? Must we not</p>
<p t="1493610" d="330">ourselves become God simply to seem worthy
of it?</p>
<p t="1493940" d="180">Well as you can tell,</p>
<p t="1494120" d="440">that's a much different notion from the
casual God is dead quotation</p>
<p t="1494560" d="500">that's most generally associated with Nietzsche
. Well what is he saying? Well he's saying</p>
<p t="1495060" d="540">something like this:</p>
<p t="1495600" d="60">A system like Christianity,</p>
<p t="1495660" d="220">or any system that's con, that's oriented
a society for thousands and thousands of years</p>
<p t="1495880" d="200">can't simply be, be eradicated by a casual
gesture without consequences ensuing in its</p>
<p t="1496080" d="10">aftermath.</p>
<p t="1496090" d="30">What consequences?</p>
<p t="1496120" d="160">Well Nietzsche says, well we'll no longer
know up from down.</p>
<p t="1496280" d="1300">What does he mean by that, metaphorically?</p>
<p t="1497580" d="4270">Well up, that's where you're headed, right?
And down, that's what you want to stay away</p>
<p t="1501850" d="280">from,</p>
<p t="1502130" d="3580">and when you eradicate the most fundamental
presuppositions of your system of values,</p>
<p t="1505710" d="3590">then there is no up and there is no down,
and then where are you precisely? Well it's</p>
<p t="1509300" d="1540">not so easy, it's not so easy to say, having
not necessarily ever been in that position.</p>
<p t="1510840" d="3890">What is your life like when you don't know
up from down? Is it merely neutral?</p>
<p t="1514730" d="2610">Is, is there merely no value left, or could
it possibly be the case that if up and down</p>
<p t="1517340" d="90">have both been eradicated,</p>
<p t="1517430" d="620">that the place that you're left in is something
much more akin to a permanent state of suffering,</p>
<p t="1518050" d="1530">because maybe it's only the case that the
constant capacity to strive for up,</p>
<p t="1519580" d="1250">and being an up that you believe in,</p>
<p t="1520830" d="4640">the constant striving for up is actually what
makes your life normal to you,</p>
<p t="1525470" d="5650">and if you lost the sense of up and down,
the place that you would end up would be not</p>
<p t="1531120" d="1490">so much neutral as terrible.</p>
<p t="1532610" d="1010">Now if you have any belief system at all,
you do this, so let's say you're an advocate</p>
<p t="1533620" d="150">of left wing politics,</p>
<p t="1533770" d="4060">you take a pro-environmental stance, or an
anti-corporate stance,</p>
<p t="1537830" d="2330">which is a relatively common thing to do among
undergraduates.</p>
<p t="1540160" d="2500">What do you do when you hold that belief system?</p>
<p t="1542660" d="1110">You view the world as it lays itself out,</p>
<p t="1543770" d="1270">and you explain the manner in which it manifests
itself in terms of the axioms of that belief</p>
<p t="1545040" d="320">system,</p>
<p t="1545360" d="2050">and you may know that you can do it, right,</p>
<p t="1547410" d="3950">you can tell a credible story about why the
world is the way it is</p>
<p t="1551360" d="310">by adopting, say, an anti-corporate perspective,
because there are all sorts of terrible things</p>
<p t="1551670" d="60">about the world</p>
<p t="1551730" d="180">that are a consequence, say, of corporate
maneuvering,</p>
<p t="1551910" d="240">and you might also say that, and Piaget would
say this,</p>
<p t="1552150" d="1040">that it's a necessary developmental stage
to acquire allegiance to a given belief system.</p>
<p t="1553190" d="100">Why?</p>
<p t="1553290" d="1330">Well any up is better than none, that might
be the first observation,</p>
<p t="1554620" d="2580">so even if your belief system is relatively
insufficient and easily challenged on intellectual</p>
<p t="1557200" d="370">grounds</p>
<p t="1557570" d="390">and perhaps not very complete anyways, the
fact that it does lay out a moral structure</p>
<p t="1557960" d="1200">and tell you good from evil and right from
wrong, that's a, that's a plus, that's</p>
<p t="1559160" d="10">an advantage.</p>
<p t="1559170" d="80">Now it's relative intellectual weakness
and it's incoherence assuming it, it is</p>
<p t="1559250" d="50">incoherent to some degree, that's a flaw,</p>
<p t="1559300" d="3570">but that doesn't mean that the effort to
establish a system like that is worthless;</p>
<p t="1562870">moral system.</p>
<p t="1564330" d="1560">is because they felt that the order Hitler
promised repressive as it was,</p>
<p t="1565890" d="1640">was preferable to the chaos that was likely
to ensue in its absence.</p>
<p t="1567530" d="1330">What is it about chaos that's so terrifying?</p>
<p t="1568860" d="1310">Second Nietzsche said: adopting a belief system
of any sort and imposing coherency on the</p>
<p t="1570170" d="410">viewing it through the lens of that explicit
system disciplines your mind.</p>
<p t="1570580" d="370">So for example</p>
<p t="1570950" d="1490">to live in the absence of any stated beliefs
is hardly to live at all.</p>
<p t="1572440" d="930">To live in the presence of a narrow minded
and extreme belief system</p>
<p t="1573370" d="1550">is at least to undergo the rigors both behavioral
and intellectual</p>
<p t="1574920" d="1030">of coming to terms with the world from some
perspective.</p>
<p t="1575950" d="1100">Nietzsche said the reason the modern mind
such as it is</p>
<p t="1577050" d="1440">was able to free itself from the past at all
was because it had first thoroughly</p>
<p t="1578490" d="170">as a consequence of that subordination to
then break free of it.</p>
<p t="1578660" d="270">In all science of morals so far one thing
was lacking strange as it may sound the problem</p>
<p t="1578930" d="20">of morality itself.</p>
<p t="1578950" d="740">What was lacking was any suspicion that there
was something problematic here.</p>
<p t="1579690" d="450">Every society every functioning individual
every functioning family every social unit</p>
<p t="1580140" d="170">has a moral code.</p>
<p t="1580310" d="370">But they differ. So what does that mean exactly</p>
<p t="1580680" d="580">what, it's complicated isn't it because
the fact of the universality of the code</p>
<p t="1581260" d="570">the fact of the code indicates that the code
or a code is necessary.</p>
<p t="1581830" d="620">By the same token the fact that there's a
multiplicity of codes seems to suggest</p>
<p t="1582450" d="410">that the particulars of a given code aren't
necessarily relevant</p>
<p t="1582860" d="40">and so Nietzsche says brilliantly I think
we're faced with a problem.</p>
<p t="1582900" d="30">No life without morality - no absolute morality.
What do we do?</p>
<p t="1582930" d="410">One of the things Jung observed was that if
you look at the structure of stories</p>
<p t="1583340" d="510">we thought first there's a relationship between
stories and moral codes.</p>
<p t="1583850" d="860">Well seems relatively straightforward doesn't
it.</p>
<p t="1584710" d="330">You tell a simple story like a parable sometimes
they're complex too like an Aesop's fable</p>
<p t="1585040" d="20">say.</p>
<p t="1585060" d="560">What do you extract out from the story? A
moral.</p>
<p t="1585620" d="670">and that person does better or worse and the
moral of the story is if you act in this manner</p>
<p t="1586290" d="170">you will do better or worse.</p>
<p t="1586460" d="50">Proverbial knowledge.</p>
<p t="1586510" d="110">We all tell stories.</p>
<p t="1586620" d="390">They have identifiable structure you can tell
that because the movie studio in Hollywood</p>
<p t="1587010" d="360">can produce a movie and people all over the
world will watch it</p>
<p t="1587370" d="380">people all over the world all over the world
tell stories to one another.</p>
<p t="1587750" d="250">The plot elements seem similar. Are the morals
similar?</p>
<p t="1588000" d="300">That's a more difficult question, right,</p>
<p t="1588300" d="90">we know that the details of morality can vary
from culture to culture,</p>
<p t="1588390" d="60">is there anything that doesn't vary from
culture to culture?</p>
<p t="1588450" d="40">Why would you wanna find that?</p>
<p t="1588490" d="90">Well Alexander Solzhenitsyn thought that one
of the most important occurrences of the 20th</p>
<p t="1588580" d="10">century</p>
<p t="1588590" d="20">were the Nuremberg trials.</p>
<p t="1588610" d="90">The Nuremberg trials brought the perpetrators
of the Nazi genocide to justice</p>
<p t="1588700" d="870">and that's easy to be cynical about that
and perhaps you should be cynical about it</p>
<p t="1589570" d="1040">and so of course the losers were going to
be tried from the perspective of the winner's</p>
<p t="1590610" d="160">moral code</p>
<p t="1590770" d="2850">but Solzhenitsyn says well wait you know there's
something more to this story at least there</p>
<p t="1593620" d="710">seems to be</p>
<p t="1594330" d="1920">in that many of the events that characterized
the Nazi atrocities</p>
<p t="1596250" d="50">were so awful, outside of intellectual argumentation,
because you can provide an intellectual argument</p>
<p t="1596300" d="10">for anything</p>
<p t="1596310" d="40">they were so awful that the proper visceral
embodied response of any observer</p>
<p t="1596350" d="50">regardless of specific moral code should be
repugnant. Period. Such that encoded at least</p>
<p t="1596400" d="10">initially in international law</p>
<p t="1596410" d="50">genocide is a crime against humanity. Right.
No matter what the particulars of your moral</p>
<p t="1596460" d="10">code.</p>
<p t="1596470" d="40">So goes the logic. You cannot construct a
viable moral code that enables genocide,</p>
<p t="1596510" d="50">if not a logical impossibility and I think
it is a logical impossibility</p>
<p t="1596560" d="10">it's an ethical impossibility.</p>
<p t="1596570" d="50">And then you have to ask yourself, and this
is not precisely an intellectual question,</p>
<p t="1596620" d="20">does that seem credible to you.</p>
<p t="1596640" d="50">Does it seem credible that there are acts
that are so terrible</p>
<p t="1596690" d="40">that no one regardless of their stated position
should ever engage in them.</p>
<p t="1596730" d="60">And if the answer is yes then I would say
well if you haven't moved towards personal</p>
<p t="1596790" d="20">accept acceptance of an ultimate ";up”</p>
<p t="1596810" d="130">so to speak you've certainly identified
at least one ";down"; that you don't want</p>
<p t="1596940" d="40">to approach.</p>
<p t="1596980" d="280">And that's the beginnings of the establishment
of some notion of absolute moral authority.</p>
<p t="1597260" d="180">So what if we said, hypothetically something
like this.</p>
<p t="1597440" d="250">Let's say that morality isn't a philosophy,
it's not something explicit, something implicit.</p>
<p t="1597690" d="80">How does it evolve?</p>
<p t="1597770" d="90">Well emotional creatures produce it,</p>
<p t="1597860" d="950">you don't have to produce it in isolation
if you were weren't a social animal i</p>
<p t="1598810" d="240">if you lived a solitary and nocturnal existence,by
yourself</p>
<p t="1599050" d="350">there's no need for morality because you don't
have to regulate your behaviour</p>
<p t="1599400" d="410">with regards to your peers but you're social
animals so you're stuck with everybody else</p>
<p t="1599810" d="320">but everybody else could be conceived us as
a grand average right.</p>
<p t="1600130" d="220">How would you act towards the average person.</p>
<p t="1600350" d="1350">I would say that very, very stable moral systems
tell you exactly that and the say things like:</p>
<p t="1601700" d="1300">do unto others as you would have them do unto
you. Right? Basic principle of reciprocity.</p>
<p t="1603000">what am I doing that's unacceptable and
not good</p>
<p t="1603280" d="120">it who knows</p>
<p t="1603400" d="640">is distributed sanity you don't have to
be that sane, as long as you're hanging around</p>
<p t="1604040" d="80">other people</p>
<p t="1604120" d="600">because as soon as you do something that's
deviant they're gonna raise an eyebrow at</p>
<p t="1604720" d="30">you</p>
<p t="1604750" d="110">and the you think oh well. Not that.</p>
<p t="1604860" d="230">And as soon as you do something good then
they're gonna pay more attention and smile</p>
<p t="1605090" d="30">at you</p>
<p t="1605120" d="520">so all of the information about how to regulate
yourself is out there in the world right,</p>
<p t="1605640" d="100">the averaged person.</p>
<p t="1605740" d="1680">How many people do you interact with in a
week? 300 say maybe it's not that many,</p>
<p t="1607420" d="150">100.</p>
<p t="1607570" d="4010">How about in a year, thousand, 2000, 5000,
10,000 what are they all telling you?</p>
<p t="1611580" d="2080">Well the message is similar across people.</p>
<p t="1613660" d="5200">How similar. Don't know exactly how similar
but that's what stories tell you how similar.</p>
