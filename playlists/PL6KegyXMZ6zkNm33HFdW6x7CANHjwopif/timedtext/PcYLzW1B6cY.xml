<p t="1370" d="9740">Alright, so I was thinking today about how
to explain this a little bit further.</p>
<p t="11110" d="12200">So let’s say you’re going for a job interview.</p>
<p t="23310" d="3930">And you’re nervous about it.</p>
<p t="27240" d="6860">And you go into the job interview and there
are some people there, and some chairs and</p>
<p t="34100" d="6540">tables, and a room that’s like this, maybe
not quite this ugly, but something like this.</p>
<p t="40640" d="3419">What’s in the room?</p>
<p t="44059" d="3020">You’re nervous.</p>
<p t="47079" d="3991">You’ve seen chairs and tables before, you’ve
seen people.</p>
<p t="51070" d="5739">What’s in the room?</p>
<p t="56809" d="4201">How about a set of alternate futures?</p>
<p t="61010" d="2610">Right?</p>
<p t="63620" d="1430">You know, that isn’t how we think.</p>
<p t="65050" d="2590">It’s how we act.</p>
<p t="67640" d="5080">And you know, if you talk about it, I was
nervous about going to this job interview.</p>
<p t="72720" d="1000">Why?</p>
<p t="73720" d="1660">Well I thought I might be evaluated.</p>
<p t="75380" d="2170">Okay, well why does that matter?</p>
<p t="77550" d="4420">Well, we know partly why it matters if we
look at this figure again.</p>
<p t="81970" d="6230">I’m pretty happy with this figure, all things
considered.</p>
<p t="88200" d="7480">You know, and you might say, well if I…
maybe it’ll shape my faith and my belief</p>
<p t="95680" d="2270">that I’m a good person.</p>
<p t="97950" d="2690">That would be a little silly for an interview.</p>
<p t="100640" d="5720">So if you’re thinking that way I would say
you’re not thinking specifically enough.</p>
<p t="106360" d="3840">Because there’s lots of reasons you might
not do well at the job interview, including</p>
<p t="110200" d="3940">the fact that they might have already given
the job to someone else, for all you know.</p>
<p t="114140" d="9610">So you don’t want to leap to the top of
the hierarchy without cause.</p>
<p t="123750" d="5399">So one of the things you might say is that
in the room there, there are threats that</p>
<p t="129149" d="8721">might be posed to any level of the hierarchy
of beliefs and behaviours that you use to</p>
<p t="137870" d="3910">interact with the world.</p>
<p t="141780" d="2099">Now the terror management people would tell
you…</p>
<p t="143879" d="2370">let’s assume that this [points to figure
on board] is a belief structure.</p>
<p t="146249" d="4440">I don’t care whether you agree with the
way it’s represented graphically or not,</p>
<p t="150689" d="4241">for the time being, but let’s just assume
that what we’re talking about is a belief</p>
<p t="154930" d="1000">structure.</p>
<p t="155930" d="6389">Now the terror management people would tell
you that you have that belief structure, in</p>
<p t="162319" d="4631">large part to protect you from the fear of
death, from death anxiety.</p>
<p t="166950" d="6319">But there’s a bunch of problems with that
idea, not least that it actually side-steps</p>
<p t="173269" d="3121">the issue of the function of the belief system.</p>
<p t="176390" d="4780">It’s like, you don’t exactly have a belief
system to make philosophical sense out of</p>
<p t="181170" d="1620">the world.</p>
<p t="182790" d="9649">You have a system of tools, that are embodied,
that allow you to actually act in the world.</p>
<p t="192439" d="6280">Now you might also have an articulated representation
of that on top that’s more or less accurate.</p>
<p t="198719" d="3490">Probably less, all things considered.</p>
<p t="202209" d="3870">And you know, maybe if your faith in that
is shaken, your faith in what you do will</p>
<p t="206079" d="3571">also be shaken, because the two things are
associated.</p>
<p t="209650" d="5030">But we should always remember that a belief
system doesn’t just protect you from the</p>
<p t="214680" d="3179">fear of death, it protects you from death.</p>
<p t="217859" d="1460">And that’s a lot different, you know.</p>
<p t="219319" d="7530">I mean, this whole thing is your set of skills,
and the perceptions and thoughts and emotions</p>
<p t="226849" d="4451">that go along with those skills, and then
it’s an integrated structure consisting</p>
<p t="231300" d="4969">of the particular manner in which you’ve
integrated all your own little sub-parts and</p>
<p t="236269" d="1300">then in relationship to the whole community.</p>
<p t="237569" d="6241">You could also think about it, in some sense,
as a holographic representation of the culture.</p>
<p t="243810" d="4170">Now, I don’t know how much you guys know
about holographs.</p>
<p t="247980" d="2119">I don’t know very much about them either.</p>
<p t="250099" d="5180">But there are some things I know about them…
so if you shine a light on a holograph, you’ll</p>
<p t="255279" d="6670">get a 3D image of whatever was there when
the holograph was created; it’s created</p>
<p t="261949" d="2981">by lasers.</p>
<p t="264930" d="3959">And if you take a holograph and you break
it into pieces, and then you shine a light</p>
<p t="268889" d="4331">on the pieces, you get the object in each
piece.</p>
<p t="273220" d="2419">But it’s low resolution.</p>
<p t="275639" d="4240">It’s a nice way of thinking about a person.</p>
<p t="279879" d="5850">Like if your brain is damaged you’ll be
there, but as a lower resolution representation</p>
<p t="285729" d="1000">of yourself.</p>
<p t="286729" d="2801">But it’s also a really nice way of thinking
about what culture is.</p>
<p t="289530" d="10819">You know, culture is this massive structure
of multiple levels and domains, but it’s</p>
<p t="300349" d="1000">reflected in each of us.</p>
<p t="301349" d="2111">Like, we’re each partial carriers of it.</p>
<p t="303460" d="5150">So we embody a partial representation of the
structure.</p>
<p t="308610" d="2330">I mean literally, we embody it.</p>
<p t="310940" d="1349">And then we also represent it abstractly.</p>
<p t="312289" d="6451">And you know, part of the reason that you
go to a university is to, in some sense, improve</p>
<p t="318740" d="2620">your capacity to articulate your structure.</p>
<p t="321360" d="4290">Right, because you’re a cultural creature…
it’s like, why are you the way you are?</p>
<p t="325650" d="4229">Well, some of it is psychological, some of
it is sociological, some of it is historical.</p>
<p t="329879" d="1701">Like a lot of it is historical.</p>
<p t="331580" d="5970">So when you go and you study a social science
or a humanity, you’re studying your own</p>
<p t="337550" d="1239">personality.</p>
<p t="338789" d="9771">Now, I wrote a paper a while back with a couple
of my graduate students, and I think it was</p>
<p t="348560" d="1550">called The Entropy…</p>
<p t="350110" d="4559">God, you’d think I would remember this…</p>
<p t="354669" d="2381">The Entropy… doesn’t matter.</p>
<p t="357050" d="5700">The hypothesis was, and this is something
I’ve been think about for a long time, that</p>
<p t="362750" d="4650">the world is very, very complex, and so what
that means is that the act of getting from</p>
<p t="367400" d="3410">one place to another is often very, very difficult.</p>
<p t="370810" d="4070">And part of what you’re doing when you put
together a functional sub-module is you’re</p>
<p t="374880" d="4940">putting together a little routine that will
enable you to transform some part of time</p>
<p t="379820" d="4170">and space from what it is into what you want
it to be.</p>
<p t="383990" d="3929">And in some sense what you’re doing is reducing
the complexity of that situation.</p>
<p t="387919" d="3011">So imagine this, you’re going for your job
interview.</p>
<p t="390930" d="2579">And you’re knocking ‘em dead.</p>
<p t="393509" d="1011">What happens?</p>
<p t="394520" d="7709">Well, a whole bunch of possibilities, all
that set of possibilities that was concerning</p>
<p t="402229" d="4501">you, starts to collapse towards a single solution.</p>
<p t="406730" d="5499">And that single solution is, if you’re doing
very well in the interview, it’s a positive</p>
<p t="412229" d="1000">solution.</p>
<p t="413229" d="3331">So you’re anxiety disappears and it’s
replaced with positive emotion.</p>
<p t="416560" d="4500">You get enthusiastic and excited, because
what’s happening in that room is that the</p>
<p t="421060" d="2970">path to a desirable future is opening.</p>
<p t="424030" d="3880">Now you can’t see any of this, you know,
because we’re so blinded by the idea that</p>
<p t="427910" d="7000">we see objects… we fail to perceive, in
any articulated sense, what it is that we’re</p>
<p t="434910" d="1000">actually dealing with.</p>
<p t="435910" d="5200">And I think that one way of thinking about
it is that you’re always on the edge of</p>
<p t="441110" d="3429">something that’s potential, and that’s
where you exist.</p>
<p t="444539" d="5560">You exist on this moving boundary of potential.</p>
<p t="450099" d="7350">And you can interact with it such that you
form it and it passes by you into the past.</p>
<p t="457449" d="8280">And hopefully you’re forming it in a way
that is in concordance with your better health</p>
<p t="465729" d="4500">and perhaps with the better health of the
people around you, that would be optimal.</p>
<p t="470229" d="3930">So you’re realising the potential in a genuine,
non-metaphorical sense.</p>
<p t="474159" d="4581">And that’s the thing about these representations,
you know.</p>
<p t="478740" d="4370">They’re often described as mythical, or
mythological, or metaphorical.</p>
<p t="483110" d="2359">But you know, they’re really not metaphorical.</p>
<p t="485469" d="6040">Well, that’s not exactly right, because
the Great Mother, the Great Father, they’re</p>
<p t="491509" d="6211">partially metaphorical but the thing that
they stand for as metaphors is something other</p>
<p t="497720" d="4129">than the things that we conceptualise when
we look at the world from an objective perspective.</p>
<p t="501849" d="5120">Now, we’ve talked a little bit about the
figure of the Dragon of Chaos, and I think</p>
<p t="506969" d="5591">that out of all the metaphorical images, it’s
the most difficult to grasp, because it’s</p>
<p t="512560" d="5260">that which has not yet been encountered, so
it’s neither unknown nor known.</p>
<p t="517820" d="3209">And you think, well you can’t even describe
that.</p>
<p t="521029" d="4201">Yeah, but you can encounter it, and you can
encounter it when you go into a situation</p>
<p t="525230" d="1060">that’s radically new.</p>
<p t="526290" d="5581">Let’s say it’s just the second before
you walk into a high-stakes interview, you</p>
<p t="531871" d="2199">know, just before you open the door.</p>
<p t="534070" d="4850">I would say that’s as close as you get,
in a normal day, to a direct encounter with</p>
<p t="538920" d="2940">the dragon of chaos, because you don’t know
what’s going to happen.</p>
<p t="541860" d="4010">And to say, well, you’re in a room and there’s
a door in front of you, you know it’s almost</p>
<p t="545870" d="1950">moronic to think of it that way, right?</p>
<p t="547820" d="2540">Because what the hell does that have to do
with anything?</p>
<p t="550360" d="7610">It’s… what’s in there is unbelievably…
like it’s the localisation of unbelievably</p>
<p t="557970" d="1560">complex webs of causality.</p>
<p t="559530" d="2619">That’s what’s waiting for you inside that
room.</p>
<p t="562149" d="4940">And then you might say, well is it structured
in any real way, and the answer to that is</p>
<p t="567089" d="1000">not really.</p>
<p t="568089" d="5101">It’s no more structured than… it’s even
less structured than a book you’re reading.</p>
<p t="573190" d="3949">You know, if you’re reading a book you might
say, well where’s the meaning in this book?</p>
<p t="577139" d="3260">And the answer to that is, well it’s not
in the book.</p>
<p t="580399" d="4511">Like it’s partly there, because you need
the words and the sentences and the paragraphs</p>
<p t="584910" d="4410">and all that, but you need the whole cultural
context around it in order to interpret it.</p>
<p t="589320" d="2840">So you’re not reading it blank.</p>
<p t="592160" d="4600">You come to it with a set of, a very large
set of presuppositions.</p>
<p t="596760" d="3590">Enough of them so that you can understand
the author.</p>
<p t="600350" d="5100">Now maybe you can’t, and the book’s over
your head, or it’s badly written, but typically,</p>
<p t="605450" d="5889">you come at it with the machinery in place,
so that when you interact with the words and</p>
<p t="611339" d="5831">the phrases and the sentences and so forth,
revelations of new meaning pour forth.</p>
<p t="617170" d="4659">And so, I don’t know how to say it any clearer
than that, that’s what the meaning of the</p>
<p t="621829" d="1000">book is.</p>
<p t="622829" d="3450">And it’s in the dialectical interaction
between you and the book.</p>
<p t="626279" d="4781">Well, if you walk into an interview room,
it’s even less given, in some sense, than</p>
<p t="631060" d="1000">the book, right.</p>
<p t="632060" d="4110">Because what’s going to happen in there,
which really means which of the many futures</p>
<p t="636170" d="5490">that that room contains is going to manifest
itself, depends very much on how you act.</p>
<p t="641660" d="6750">So, it’s in that way that you collapse the
potential that’s in a particular place and</p>
<p t="648410" d="5450">you extract something out of it that’s…
well, and that’s when it gets tricky…</p>
<p t="653860" d="2240">neutral, positive, or negative?</p>
<p t="656100" d="1660">Maybe you bomb the interview, right?</p>
<p t="657760" d="2090">And then you might say, well what’s happened?</p>
<p t="659850" d="1000">What happened?</p>
<p t="660850" d="3450">Well that’s a very complicated question.</p>
<p t="664300" d="1590">Then you’re stuck with this hierarchy, right.</p>
<p t="665890" d="2300">And that’s what you’re going to do when
you go home.</p>
<p t="668190" d="3889">You’re going to say “well maybe I didn’t
dress properly, or maybe I didn’t get to</p>
<p t="672079" d="3641">the interview on time, or they asked me a
bunch of questions I wasn’t prepared for,</p>
<p t="675720" d="4600">or Jesus, I didn’t know anything about what’s
going on, my whole education was a waste of</p>
<p t="680320" d="1879">time, and what the hell am I doing”?</p>
<p t="682199" d="2690">And then you might go “I’m never going
to get a job”.</p>
<p t="684889" d="4901">And you know, you could say in some sense
that all of those hypotheses, as you move</p>
<p t="689790" d="7720">up and down the hierarchy, you move from trivial
trouble to really not good trouble, as you</p>
<p t="697510" d="5710">bounce, and all of that is an attempt to specify,
in some sense, what that room contained.</p>
<p t="703220" d="1750">And it’s not easy.</p>
<p t="704970" d="6490">It’s weird too, because the room can contain
things that alter your past.</p>
<p t="711460" d="5460">Because maybe you say, well maybe you’re
going for a computer science job, maybe you’re</p>
<p t="716920" d="1000">not, whatever.</p>
<p t="717920" d="3230">You go in there and you think you’re the
top person in your class, and maybe you were,</p>
<p t="721150" d="3110">but you know the people in there are so far
ahead of you that you can’t even imagine</p>
<p t="724260" d="1000">ever catching up.</p>
<p t="725260" d="6019">And you know, when you come out of there,
the manner in which you construe your educational</p>
<p t="731279" d="3120">history is going to be radically transformed.</p>
<p t="734399" d="3940">So there’s a lot of trouble in that room.</p>
<p t="738339" d="1831">There’s a lot.</p>
<p t="740170" d="4030">Now one of the things we though in this paper…
you can think of each of those little eggs,</p>
<p t="744200" d="8060">they’re really eggs, as a container, and
what they contain is entropy, trouble.</p>
<p t="752260" d="3210">And the smaller ones contain smaller amounts
of entropy and the bigger ones contain bigger</p>
<p t="755470" d="1000">amounts of entropy.</p>
<p t="756470" d="2410">And so, here’s another example.</p>
<p t="758880" d="5200">You’re driving down the highway and your
car sputters and grinds to a halt.</p>
<p t="764080" d="4150">Maybe it makes a nice radical noise while
it’s doing it.</p>
<p t="768230" d="2900">So okay, well, what happened?</p>
<p t="771130" d="7500">Well the answer is, the simple answer is,
your car malfunctioned and you had to pull</p>
<p t="778630" d="1000">off the road.</p>
<p t="779630" d="1000">That’s a really object-oriented analysis.</p>
<p t="780630" d="4170">But what’s actually happened is that you
had a conceptualisation of the car as a pragmatic</p>
<p t="784800" d="6479">tool, because what do you know about the damn
car?</p>
<p t="791279" d="6321">The car was an affordance, that’s the right
word, that would get you from point A to point</p>
<p t="797600" d="2570">B, and you could have a very low-resolution
model of it, right?</p>
<p t="800170" d="4510">It can just look like a plastic shell, which
is sort of what a car looks like.</p>
<p t="804680" d="4680">And as long as you see how low-resolution
that is, you could replace it with a cartoon</p>
<p t="809360" d="2979">and you wouldn’t even notice.</p>
<p t="812339" d="3750">That’s good enough representation as long
as the thing is doing what it’s supposed</p>
<p t="816089" d="1000">to be doing.</p>
<p t="817089" d="3471">But as soon as it stops doing what it’s
supposed to be doing then it could be any</p>
<p t="820560" d="1570">old thing.</p>
<p t="822130" d="1800">And you think, well what does any old thing
mean?</p>
<p t="823930" d="3230">Well maybe you’re on a deserted highway
and it’s one o’clock in the morning.</p>
<p t="827160" d="2270">And you know, someone pulls over to help you.</p>
<p t="829430" d="2040">Okay, well, what’s that?</p>
<p t="831470" d="4820">Well, you know, believe me, your imagination
will rapidly span the world of possibility</p>
<p t="836290" d="4000">from “oh good, someone’s come to help”
to “I’m going to be dragged off in the</p>
<p t="840290" d="1270">bush and killed”.</p>
<p t="841560" d="4110">And that’s all contained in that sequence
of events.</p>
<p t="845670" d="5770">And then even if no one does stop, and you
have to worry about exactly what’s gone</p>
<p t="851440" d="2440">wrong, and you have to worry about how you’re
going to fix it and you have to worry about</p>
<p t="853880" d="3070">the mechanic that might help you, and you
have to concern yourself with whether or not</p>
<p t="856950" d="2829">you’re going to need a new car, and then
you have to think about your finances.</p>
<p t="859779" d="8381">It’s like, the idea that that car is a bounded
entity, like it looks, is only true when it</p>
<p t="868160" d="1000">works.</p>
<p t="869160" d="3869">And as soon as it doesn’t work, then God,
it’s any old thing.</p>
<p t="873029" d="3071">And that, in some sense, is the dragon of
chaos.</p>
<p t="876100" d="4570">Now, what seems to me to have happened…
because you might think, well how did people</p>
<p t="880670" d="3810">come to conceptualise such a thing, because
I would think that, of all the things that</p>
<p t="884480" d="5830">are difficult to conceptualise, the category
of all things that you have not yet encountered</p>
<p t="890310" d="2529">is the most difficult thing to discover, right?</p>
<p t="892839" d="1000">It’s kind of like zero.</p>
<p t="893839" d="3711">It took people a long time to figure out zero,
and no wonder.</p>
<p t="897550" d="2460">We need a symbol for nothing.</p>
<p t="900010" d="2460">Well, this is even worse.</p>
<p t="902470" d="2679">We need a representation for potential.</p>
<p t="905149" d="1461">Well, you think, why?</p>
<p t="906610" d="4680">Well it’s because it’s actually potential
that you’re interacting with all the time.</p>
<p t="911290" d="6279">Now what seems to me to have happened was
that… you know, this is an evolutionary</p>
<p t="917569" d="6161">just-so story, so I’m not assuming that
it worked precisely this way, but it doesn’t</p>
<p t="923730" d="1000">matter.</p>
<p t="924730" d="3560">Because I’m going to touch on the appropriate
features.</p>
<p t="928290" d="2650">Well one of the things we know about social
animals, generally speaking, and animals in</p>
<p t="930940" d="3829">general, is that they have a territory, right?</p>
<p t="934769" d="3060">And so you think, well what is their territory
exactly?</p>
<p t="937829" d="2501">And you might say, well you can mark it out.</p>
<p t="940330" d="6080">Here’s a… oh, what would have a territory?</p>
<p t="946410" d="3820">Like a tiger, they’re pretty solitary, so
it’ll be simple.</p>
<p t="950230" d="1719">They have a big territory, right?</p>
<p t="951949" d="3001">And it’s hundreds of square miles.</p>
<p t="954950" d="2949">And the reason for that is, well they’re
tigers.</p>
<p t="957899" d="3841">You can’t have like fifty of them, because
they’ll just eat everything that’s there.</p>
<p t="961740" d="4890">You know, you have to have a big territory
to support one apex predator.</p>
<p t="966630" d="2930">So then you might say, well what exactly is
the territory of the tiger?</p>
<p t="969560" d="3440">And you’d say well here are its boundaries.</p>
<p t="973000" d="2050">This is where it roams.</p>
<p t="975050" d="3640">But that’s not the right way of thinking
about the territory of the tiger.</p>
<p t="978690" d="6240">Because the territory of the tiger is actually
all the places where, when the tiger does</p>
<p t="984930" d="4389">its thing, the things that the tiger wants
or expects, happen.</p>
<p t="989319" d="1411">That’s the tiger’s territory.</p>
<p t="990730" d="1979">It’s the same with you.</p>
<p t="992709" d="3941">You’re at home wherever you know what to
do.</p>
<p t="996650" d="6320">And what you’re doing when you know what
to do is you know how to match this hierarchy,</p>
<p t="1002970" d="4270">which is partly action-oriented, you know
how to match the hierarchy with the situation.</p>
<p t="1007240" d="6579">So that when you put it into practice, the
potential that’s there transforms itself</p>
<p t="1013819" d="1661">into what you’re aiming at.</p>
<p t="1015480" d="1950">And that’s your territory.</p>
<p t="1017430" d="4269">And you need to think about it that way because
your territory can shift very rapidly on you,</p>
<p t="1021699" d="3651">and if you think about it geographically,
it’s kind of confusing.</p>
<p t="1025350" d="2900">So let’s say you’re on the subway that
you always take.</p>
<p t="1028250" d="3632">And then someone sits down beside you and
they’re muttering away madly and they have</p>
<p t="1031882" d="2138">a pretty malevolent look on their face.</p>
<p t="1034020" d="3169">And you get a glimpse inside their coat and
there’s a knife.</p>
<p t="1037189" d="3221">It’s like, you’re not in your territory
anymore!</p>
<p t="1040410" d="6460">And the fact that all of the objective entities
are still there arrayed around you is just</p>
<p t="1046870" d="6090">a… it’s nothing more than a… it’s
a delusion at that point to think that those</p>
<p t="1052960" d="2770">things characterise where you are.</p>
<p t="1055730" d="5900">Okay so, if you’re willing to consider territory
as that… it’s a space-time continuum,</p>
<p t="1061630" d="1000">okay?</p>
<p t="1062630" d="1330">And the reason I’m stressing that…</p>
<p t="1063960" d="5060">I mean, first of all, whatever reality is,
is a space-time continuum, right?</p>
<p t="1069020" d="3070">It’s got three dimensions of space and one
dimension of time.</p>
<p t="1072090" d="6190">And everyone knows that, as we sit here, more
or less stable in three dimensions, time flows</p>
<p t="1078280" d="2009">past us, in some sense.</p>
<p t="1080289" d="5120">And so the three-dimensional reality is transforming
all by itself, just because of time.</p>
<p t="1085409" d="5721">Okay, and so when we’re mapping out our
territories, we map out space-time territories.</p>
<p t="1091130" d="5280">And so, that means that not only do you know
where you are, you know when you are.</p>
<p t="1096410" d="3700">And if you’re in your territory you know
how to act through that place and that time</p>
<p t="1100110" d="4710">so that you transform the potential that’s
there into whatever it is that you’re aiming</p>
<p t="1104820" d="1000">at.</p>
<p t="1105820" d="2290">Okay, so that’s your territory.</p>
<p t="1108110" d="8330">Now, that territory is isomorphic evolutionarily
with lots of things, which you could also</p>
<p t="1116440" d="1430">confuse geographically.</p>
<p t="1117870" d="6700">So you might think of a human territory as
something like… it’s probably, the fundamental</p>
<p t="1124570" d="3700">human territory is probably a fire.</p>
<p t="1128270" d="5680">And so the fire is a place of light in the
darkness and then you could think of rings,</p>
<p t="1133950" d="6400">concentric rings of relative safety surrounding
the fire.</p>
<p t="1140350" d="3790">So right beside the fire, where it’s warm
and light and there’s lots of other people,</p>
<p t="1144140" d="2700">man that’s explored territory, you know?</p>
<p t="1146840" d="3760">But then if you start wandering away from
the fire into the bush, especially if you’re</p>
<p t="1150600" d="6240">in a very biologically active area, then the
farther away you get from the fire the more</p>
<p t="1156840" d="1550">you’re going outside your territory.</p>
<p t="1158390" d="3520">And you can tell that’s happening because
your whole nervous system starts to function</p>
<p t="1161910" d="1000">differently.</p>
<p t="1162910" d="6090">What happens is that the nervous system parts
that you were using while you were in known</p>
<p t="1169000" d="5080">territory, they just shut down, and then other
nervous system elements that you used in unknown</p>
<p t="1174080" d="1780">territory start to turn on.</p>
<p t="1175860" d="2910">And generally you’re not very happy about
that.</p>
<p t="1178770" d="7840">Because when you’re aware you’ve mastered
the territory, you can presume that neutral</p>
<p t="1186610" d="4870">or moderately good things are going to happen,
with the possibility of something great now</p>
<p t="1191480" d="1590">and then.</p>
<p t="1193070" d="5570">But as you move away from that, it flips in
some sense to “I don’t know what’s going</p>
<p t="1198640" d="3970">on here and I might fall” to “something’s
going to bite me” to “I’m going to die</p>
<p t="1202610" d="5660">a painful death”, you know, and you don’t
use the same circuits to process the first</p>
<p t="1208270" d="2400">situation to process the first situation as
you do to process the second.</p>
<p t="1210670" d="3460">You don’t even like having the second one
on.</p>
<p t="1214130" d="4710">So you know what it’s like… maybe you’ve
been feeling a bit down, because that always</p>
<p t="1218840" d="3949">helps, and you wake up at three in the morning
and you’re worrying about six things and</p>
<p t="1222789" d="4091">you hear some random noise somewhere there
shouldn’t be a random noise.</p>
<p t="1226880" d="6230">Well, how you feel right then, that’s what
it is like to have the system that deals with</p>
<p t="1233110" d="1390">the unexpected ‘on’.</p>
<p t="1234500" d="2039">You’re like a prey animal.</p>
<p t="1236539" d="4481">Really, really, exactly like one, because
that’s what you actually are in many ways.</p>
<p t="1241020" d="5220">So you know, your whole biology transforms
so that you’re prepared for God only knows</p>
<p t="1246240" d="1010">what.</p>
<p t="1247250" d="4539">Well, what seemed to have happened in the
course of evolution was that, when we were</p>
<p t="1251789" d="9591">smaller creatures, and far after that, before
let’s say we figured out how to use throwing</p>
<p t="1261380" d="7909">sticks and slings, and then later maybe bows
and arrows, or maybe even sticks, like, we</p>
<p t="1269289" d="1451">were getting eaten a lot.</p>
<p t="1270740" d="4090">I think I told you guys last week that they
just discovered this damn cat in Africa that</p>
<p t="1274830" d="1640">looks like it preyed on our fore-bearers.</p>
<p t="1276470" d="5020">And we have pretty hard skulls so the normal
cat can’t really gnaw through them, but</p>
<p t="1281490" d="3289">this cat had a special set of teeth, and if
it grabbed the front of your head it would</p>
<p t="1284779" d="3051">drive one of its teeth right through the back
of your skull.</p>
<p t="1287830" d="4780">So you know, the hominids were preyed on enough
so that they had their own predators.</p>
<p t="1292610" d="4620">Well, so you know, that’s just not very
pleasant.</p>
<p t="1297230" d="2150">And then, that’s by the time we were hominids.</p>
<p t="1299380" d="3730">You can go back farther than that to when
we were little tree rats, roughly speaking,</p>
<p t="1303110" d="1660">and then all sorts of things were eating us.</p>
<p t="1304770" d="4990">There were a lot of reptiles back then, sixty
million years ago, and they weren’t pleasant.</p>
<p t="1309760" d="4450">There were still dinosaurs around sixty million
years ago.</p>
<p t="1314210" d="4870">You know, that’s a lot of evolutionary time
for us to have developed biological systems</p>
<p t="1319080" d="4360">that distinguish between places we’re safe
and places we’re not safe.</p>
<p t="1323440" d="9040">Well, you roughly have one set of neuropsychological,
neuropsychophysiological functions for familiar</p>
<p t="1332480" d="2730">territory and another set for unfamiliar territory.</p>
<p t="1335210" d="5950">Now what I would say… this is where this
becomes, I think, radically different to terror</p>
<p t="1341160" d="6400">management theory, what these hierarchy is
doing when it’s functioning is shutting</p>
<p t="1347560" d="5010">off… is keeping a system that operates in
unexplored territory shut off.</p>
<p t="1352570" d="1000">And you like that.</p>
<p t="1353570" d="2849">And that’s when you’re calm.</p>
<p t="1356419" d="4701">Like you are in here, you’re relatively
at home here, because you assume that you</p>
<p t="1361120" d="4789">know how to act here, as long as you sit and
ask questions more or less appropriately and</p>
<p t="1365909" d="3281">you don’t bother people and you don’t
talk on your phone, and various other things,</p>
<p t="1369190" d="6330">the probability that you’re going to confronted
by an angry primate or some other predator</p>
<p t="1375520" d="2159">is very, very low.</p>
<p t="1377679" d="5531">And so, you’d say, well you’re normal.</p>
<p t="1383210" d="1849">You feel like you do normally here.</p>
<p t="1385059" d="3911">But I would say the only reason you feel that
way normally to begin with is because you</p>
<p t="1388970" d="3250">don’t go places where you feel not normal.</p>
<p t="1392220" d="1300">You stay away from them.</p>
<p t="1393520" d="3789">And everyone knows what those places are like.</p>
<p t="1397309" d="3360">I saw a real cool example of this once.</p>
<p t="1400669" d="5951">I was down by OCAD at about midnight on a
Saturday night.</p>
<p t="1406620" d="5539">You know, it was in the summer so there were
all these kids, really, wandering around in</p>
<p t="1412159" d="2541">their party clothes and going to the clubs.</p>
<p t="1414700" d="5910">And I was standing there watching and I looked
through a park at this street that runs by</p>
<p t="1420610" d="3949">near OCAD and there were these houses.</p>
<p t="1424559" d="4860">There was a row of houses and there were three
houses here and they were all really nicely</p>
<p t="1429419" d="3401">taken care of, then there was a house here,
and then there were some more houses over</p>
<p t="1432820" d="1479">here that were well taken care of.</p>
<p t="1434299" d="2990">And that house in the middle was condemned.</p>
<p t="1437289" d="3811">So the roof was rotting and they’d boarded
up all the windows, and the fence was falling</p>
<p t="1441100" d="4220">off and there was garbage in the yard, it
was a derelict place, you know.</p>
<p t="1445320" d="2239">So that’s kind of a spooky place.</p>
<p t="1447559" d="5911">Well, while I was standing there this guy
walked down the street, and he was very intoxicated,</p>
<p t="1453470" d="2670">and he wasn’t very happy and he was sort
of muttering to himself.</p>
<p t="1456140" d="4330">And he passed the three houses that were in
pretty good shape, and then as soon as he</p>
<p t="1460470" d="4650">got in front of the house that was derelict,
he just started to rant, and he was pounding</p>
<p t="1465120" d="4789">up and down and muttering paranoid things,
and you know, sounding really dangerous.</p>
<p t="1469909" d="4900">But he kept more or less moving forward, and
then just after he got back past that borderline</p>
<p t="1474809" d="4801">and back into the more or less normal neighbourhood,
he switched back to just mumbling quietly</p>
<p t="1479610" d="1000">and kept moving forward.</p>
<p t="1480610" d="3210">And you know he was just so damn intoxicated,
there isn’t a possibility that he noticed</p>
<p t="1483820" d="4440">what had happened, but he was being cued by
the surroundings, you know, and it was a different</p>
<p t="1488260" d="6159">‘him’ when he was in unexplored territory,
something that had degenerated back into chaos.</p>
<p t="1494419" d="3610">So the anger and aggression came out of him
because that’s often necessary if you’re</p>
<p t="1498029" d="2431">going to be where there’s chaos.</p>
<p t="1500460" d="4260">You know, and chaos can burst forth, and does,
all the time in people’s lives, you know.</p>
<p t="1504720" d="3250">If you’re sitting around the dinner table
with your family, and everything’s going</p>
<p t="1507970" d="4850">pretty well but someone touches on one of
those topics that you should just shut the</p>
<p t="1512820" d="3890">hell up about, it can take almost no time
at all before the whole thing unravels, and</p>
<p t="1516710" d="2459">then God only knows where you are.</p>
<p t="1519169" d="1711">And it’s not pleasant.</p>
<p t="1520880" d="7440">So instead of our belief systems protecting
us from death anxiety, our hierarchical pragmatic</p>
<p t="1528320" d="5540">systems for interacting with the world stop
the parts of our brain that deal with the</p>
<p t="1533860" d="2059">unexpected from being on.</p>
<p t="1535919" d="6371">And they don’t do that because we believe,
they do that because when we enact those structures,</p>
<p t="1542290" d="2590">all hell doesn’t break loose.</p>
<p t="1544880" d="1890">So there’s nothing illusory about it.</p>
<p t="1546770" d="3810">Now, you know, you might say, well, in the
final analysis, does it really protect you</p>
<p t="1550580" d="1319">from chaos?</p>
<p t="1551899" d="4951">And you know, that’s an okay question, but
most of the time that’s irrelevant.</p>
<p t="1556850" d="5210">It isn’t always irrelevant, but most of
the time it just doesn’t matter.</p>
<p t="1562060" d="6020">And the other thing is that much of the time
it doesn’t even matter if you believe this.</p>
<p t="1568080" d="6469">By which I would mean, you have an articulated
representation of it, it’s also a self-representation,</p>
<p t="1574549" d="3791">and you carry that around, and maybe you have
a crisis of faith and you don’t believe</p>
<p t="1578340" d="2130">in that, you still act all this stuff out.</p>
<p t="1580470" d="3050">And most of the time you’re still extremely
well-protected by it.</p>
<p t="1583520" d="5760">So it’s more robust than merely the articulated
or imagined version.</p>
<p t="1589280" d="1430">It’s a lot deeper than that.</p>
<p t="1590710" d="2420">It’s only a tiny part of its structure.</p>
<p t="1593130" d="5289">And so, we should never really talk about
‘belief systems’ exactly, especially not</p>
<p t="1598419" d="5191">if they’re shared with very many other people,
because they’re not structures of belief,</p>
<p t="1603610" d="2210">they’re much deeper structures than that.</p>
<p t="1605820" d="5160">And the belief part is only a pale reflection
of the underlying reality.</p>
<p t="1610980" d="1720">Okay, so that…</p>
<p t="1612700" d="3820">I presume that makes sense, and you can make
sense of that in your own life.</p>
<p t="1616520" d="3649">You know, there’s other things that can
happen too that I should mention, is lots</p>
<p t="1620169" d="5281">of times people have chaos… you know, you
think your body is explored territory, it’s</p>
<p t="1625450" d="1520">sort of the ultimate explored territory.</p>
<p t="1626970" d="4510">But I would say, don’t get too convinced
about that.</p>
<p t="1631480" d="3559">That can also switch in a moment, and it happens
to people all the time.</p>
<p t="1635039" d="5681">So if you get a tooth pulled, it takes your
tongue like three months to map the inside</p>
<p t="1640720" d="1360">of your mouth again.</p>
<p t="1642080" d="4689">So that’s re-familiarising your brain with
the new territory, right?</p>
<p t="1646769" d="1601">And that’s very, very complicated.</p>
<p t="1648370" d="2760">So your body representation is extremely complicated.</p>
<p t="1651130" d="3200">And it’s really easy to screw up.</p>
<p t="1654330" d="2770">So if you have someone go like that [crosses
forearms and hands and fingers] and then you</p>
<p t="1657100" d="3949">point to one of their fingers in the middle
and get them to move it (don’t touch it),</p>
<p t="1661049" d="5010">they often can’t, because just that’s
enough to boggle up their visual representation</p>
<p t="1666059" d="1071">of their body.</p>
<p t="1667130" d="4450">And so you can play all sorts of tricks on
people that way.</p>
<p t="1671580" d="5880">So you know, your map of your body and your
body are sort of reasonably well associated,</p>
<p t="1677460" d="6199">but they can be dissociated quite rapidly,
and you know that happens when, maybe you</p>
<p t="1683659" d="2911">get a little hypochondriacal and start worrying
about your health.</p>
<p t="1686570" d="2960">Something’s bugging you and you don’t
exactly know what it is.</p>
<p t="1689530" d="4170">It’s like, well, all of a sudden you get
alienated from your body.</p>
<p t="1693700" d="1750">And that can get really serious.</p>
<p t="1695450" d="6410">And I’ve seen people after a car accident,
this was the most striking of this, this client</p>
<p t="1701860" d="4100">I had had her shoulder up like this [stiffens
right shoulder].</p>
<p t="1705960" d="4160">And I noticed she never really looked in the
direction of that arm and when she moved it</p>
<p t="1710120" d="1419">she’d only move it about this far.</p>
<p t="1711539" d="4201">And after seeing her for a while I thought
“oh, she’s afraid of that arm”.</p>
<p t="1715740" d="2110">Now it had been hurt.</p>
<p t="1717850" d="1929">Well why would you get afraid of your arm?</p>
<p t="1719779" d="3541">Well, it doesn’t act like it used to, so
that’s annoying.</p>
<p t="1723320" d="4140">And then when you move it wrong it hurts,
and then you also don’t know that if you</p>
<p t="1727460" d="3380">move it wrong and it hurts, whether you’re
making it worse.</p>
<p t="1730840" d="4219">So then you just kind of ignore it, and then
it’s sort of your arm and sort of not your</p>
<p t="1735059" d="1000">arm.</p>
<p t="1736059" d="4931">And I had her at one point, we just practiced
just doing this [loosens shoulder].</p>
<p t="1740990" d="2630">I’d say, I’d do the action and say “can
you do this?”</p>
<p t="1743620" d="1000">[Raises left arm slightly].</p>
<p t="1744620" d="1000">She’d do it.</p>
<p t="1745620" d="1000">And then I’d go “well can you do this?”</p>
<p t="1746620" d="1000">[Raises arm slightly higher].</p>
<p t="1747620" d="1000">And she’d do it.</p>
<p t="1748620" d="1000">And then I’d say “can you do this?”</p>
<p t="1749620" d="1000">[Raises arm even higher].</p>
<p t="1750620" d="3240">We just kept doing this, it only took about
half an hour until she was up here [arm fully</p>
<p t="1753860" d="3480">raised], and she said “I haven’t put my
arm up there for two years!”</p>
<p t="1757340" d="1819">And then I did the same thing with her shoulder.</p>
<p t="1759159" d="3581">I said, “Can you lift your shoulder?”</p>
<p t="1762740" d="1000">“No.”</p>
<p t="1763740" d="2020">“Can you lift it one-sixteenth of an inch?”</p>
<p t="1765760" d="1490">Well, she could do that.</p>
<p t="1767250" d="4200">Well, you know, sixteen times one-sixteenth
of an inch is an inch, and that’s starting</p>
<p t="1771450" d="1000">to get there.</p>
<p t="1772450" d="2890">And you know, she did this a bunch and then
her arm went down.</p>
<p t="1775340" d="3709">So she’d been holding the damn arm up for
two years.</p>
<p t="1779049" d="1720">Just try that.</p>
<p t="1780769" d="3581">You know, I mean you do this [raises arm]
for five minutes and see what happens, just</p>
<p t="1784350" d="3949">hold your shoulder up there for two years
and see what that does to the entire right</p>
<p t="1788299" d="1000">side of your body.</p>
<p t="1789299" d="1801">Like it’s really, really stressful.</p>
<p t="1791100" d="5819">And then I did something strange, then, which
was a whim, but I think it was because I was</p>
<p t="1796919" d="2250">embodying her because I was paying so close
attention.</p>
<p t="1799169" d="3571">I asked her to come lean over my desk because
there was something about the way she was</p>
<p t="1802740" d="2480">holding herself that was really bugging me.</p>
<p t="1805220" d="4480">And so I asked her just to lean over my desk
and I pounded on her back down her spinal</p>
<p t="1809700" d="4640">cord and she drooped her shoulders again and
then she cried for about half an hour.</p>
<p t="1814340" d="5069">And again, it was because, she’d got hit
by a car, that’s just how she was, she just</p>
<p t="1819409" d="4271">walked around like that, permanently, more
or less.</p>
<p t="1823680" d="3749">And we worked it out of her reasonably well.</p>
<p t="1827429" d="4821">But even your own damn body can become unexplored
territory.</p>
<p t="1832250" d="5570">And that’s another way of understanding
that yin-yang symbol, right?</p>
<p t="1837820" d="5530">You’ve got the black serpent, paisley, and
it’s got a little white dot in it.</p>
<p t="1843350" d="4910">Which means that sometimes when things are
really broken all to hell a solution can come</p>
<p t="1848260" d="3850">blasting forth and chaos turns into order.</p>
<p t="1852110" d="6480">But more likely, you know, everything’s
going pretty nicely and up something comes</p>
<p t="1858590" d="3799">and the chaos spills into the order.</p>
<p t="1862389" d="2071">And that’s the world you live in.</p>
<p t="1864460" d="2260">And that’s not a metaphor.</p>
<p t="1866720" d="4120">And it’s really interesting to know that,
because then the question becomes “okay,</p>
<p t="1870840" d="3140">well, what do you do in order and what do
you do in chaos?’</p>
<p t="1873980" d="2030">Those are useful things to know.</p>
<p t="1876010" d="3710">We kind of know what to do in order because
that sort of defines order.</p>
<p t="1879720" d="4049">But we don’t really know what to do in chaos,
you know.</p>
<p t="1883769" d="4961">In fact the field of mental health is in some
sense an attempt to figure that out.</p>
<p t="1888730" d="3610">But I can tell you some things to do when
you’re in chaos.</p>
<p t="1892340" d="3090">So let’s say you’re dealing with someone
who’s very, very ill.</p>
<p t="1895430" d="2580">Or maybe it’s you that’s very, very ill.</p>
<p t="1898010" d="3520">And so God only knows what’s going to happen
in the future.</p>
<p t="1901530" d="1520">Or even next week.</p>
<p t="1903050" d="4729">Well, the first thing you do is stop thinking
about next week and the future.</p>
<p t="1907779" d="2770">Because it’s not calculable, right?</p>
<p t="1910549" d="6870">The pathways have become so multiple and so
uncontrollable that if you think about them</p>
<p t="1917419" d="2321">it’s just going to hurt you.</p>
<p t="1919740" d="4660">And so, you know, you can’t just not think
about it, because that doesn’t work.</p>
<p t="1924400" d="3619">But what you can do is narrow your time-frame
of analysis.</p>
<p t="1928019" d="3181">You know, so instead of worrying about the
week, you think okay, well let’s make this</p>
<p t="1931200" d="2250">day as good as it can be.</p>
<p t="1933450" d="3010">And then if you’re really stressed, it’s
like, no we’re going to really work on this</p>
<p t="1936460" d="1530">hour.</p>
<p t="1937990" d="7430">And so what happens is you hyper-attend to
the local space-time area and that’s what</p>
<p t="1945420" d="1000">you’ve got.</p>
<p t="1946420" d="1000">You can work with that.</p>
<p t="1947420" d="1000">And it really works.</p>
<p t="1948420" d="2700">Like if you’re dealing with people who are
dying, for example, that’s what you do.</p>
<p t="1951120" d="6130">You zero in to the right level of resolution,
fundamentally.</p>
<p t="1957250" d="4950">And you can tell when it’s the right level
of resolution because you don’t feel like</p>
<p t="1962200" d="1010">you don’t know what you’re doing anymore.</p>
<p t="1963210" d="3280">“What am I doing here, what am I supposed
to do here, what does all this mean?”</p>
<p t="1966490" d="1189">You don’t feel that anymore.</p>
<p t="1967679" d="3101">Because those are the wrong questions at that
point in time.</p>
<p t="1970780" d="3960">And you know, maybe you try to make the person
comfortable, and you pay attention, so you</p>
<p t="1974740" d="5660">can take the right micro-movements and the
right micro-attitudes in those critical moments,</p>
<p t="1980400" d="1700">and that’s what you do.</p>
<p t="1982100" d="3830">And so that’s one way of dealing with the
underworld and you need to know that, because</p>
<p t="1985930" d="2369">it’s going to happen.</p>
<p t="1988299" d="5471">So if you’re really stressed, you think
about smaller amounts of space and time.</p>
<p t="1993770" d="5399">And you try to get them right, it’s still
important to get it right, but the entropy</p>
<p t="1999169" d="5390">is so high at that point, the landscape is
so complicated, that there’s no that you</p>
<p t="2004559" d="4201">can map more than a few moments at a time.</p>
<p t="2008760" d="2490">But it turns out often that that’s okay.</p>
<p t="2011250" d="1679">That’s good enough.</p>
<p t="2012929" d="4321">You know, obviously it’s not optimal, but
one thing you can be sure of is you can take</p>
<p t="2017250" d="4549">a terrible situation and you can make it a
hell of a lot worse.</p>
<p t="2021799" d="4211">So you know, if it’s a terrible situation
and you manage it as well as it can be managed,</p>
<p t="2026010" d="2009">then maybe it’s only terrible.</p>
<p t="2028019" d="3880">But if you take a terrible situation and you
manage it really badly, then it can be something</p>
<p t="2031899" d="2081">that you never, ever recover from.</p>
<p t="2033980" d="5539">So, I’m not trying to be hyper-optimistic
about this, I know people go through rough</p>
<p t="2039519" d="1000">times.</p>
<p t="2040519" d="2551">But there’s a difference between tragedy
and hell.</p>
<p t="2043070" d="2839">And tragedy is when something happens and
you’re awake.</p>
<p t="2045909" d="4901">And hell is when something terrible happens
and you’re not awake.</p>
<p t="2050810" d="2640">And that’s a place you really don’t want
to go.</p>
<p t="2053450" d="4170">So then the death of your father could turn
into the obliteration of your entire family.</p>
<p t="2057620" d="5060">Well, you know, the first is bad enough, but
the second might well be unbearable.</p>
<p t="2062680" d="4990">You know, because people often fight in circumstances
like that, and the family gets very, very</p>
<p t="2067670" d="1000">stressed.</p>
<p t="2068670" d="4150">It’s very common, for example, if a couple
has a sick child or a child that dies that</p>
<p t="2072820" d="1180">they get divorced.</p>
<p t="2074000" d="1970">It’s not surprising, you know.</p>
<p t="2075970" d="4130">It’s not like they have a psychological
problem, they have a real problem.</p>
<p t="2080100" d="4310">And they might be amplifying it with their
psychological problems, but all problems are</p>
<p t="2084410" d="1320">not psychological.</p>
<p t="2085730" d="5010">And that’s also useful to know, because
if you end up somewhere that you don’t expect,</p>
<p t="2090740" d="3870">you’re going to be thinking (especially
if you’re conscientious): “If I wasn’t</p>
<p t="2094610" d="3910">such a useless fool, I would have never ended
up here”.</p>
<p t="2098520" d="4001">And there’s a much more pessimistic thought
than that that’s much more useful, which</p>
<p t="2102521" d="4859">is: whether you were a fool or not you were
going to end up somewhere like this now and</p>
<p t="2107380" d="1000">then.</p>
<p t="2108380" d="5040">And you might think, God, that’s a horrible
thing to think, because that means that our</p>
<p t="2113420" d="2790">destinies are uncontrollable, at least in
part.</p>
<p t="2116210" d="1900">It’s like, yeah they are.</p>
<p t="2118110" d="4600">So partly what that means is prepare yourself
for that, and don’t pound yourself into</p>
<p t="2122710" d="2360">the ground when you get there.</p>
<p t="2125070" d="4400">Because it happens to people, and it isn’t
necessarily the case that the reason it happened</p>
<p t="2129470" d="1550">to you is because you’re useless.</p>
<p t="2131020" d="4030">Now, that might have furthered the process
and all that, but you just don’t need those</p>
<p t="2135050" d="2390">thoughts at that time.</p>
<p t="2137440" d="1570">All they do is undermine you.</p>
<p t="2139010" d="7440">And when you know “yeah, you know, everybody’s
dog dies” (which is true), it’s like,</p>
<p t="2146450" d="6710">well, it takes some of the guilt out of it,
and the guilt is something that at that point</p>
<p t="2153160" d="1750">you don’t really need.</p>
<p t="2154910" d="6090">Okay, so, you’ve got your explored territory,
and we’ve kind of walked through what that</p>
<p t="2161000" d="3330">is, and then you have your unexplored territory.</p>
<p t="2164330" d="2980">And then you have the things that sort of
exist on the fringe.</p>
<p t="2167310" d="4470">I would say in some sense the things that
exist on the fringe closer to the unknown,</p>
<p t="2171780" d="3990">those are usually symbolised by the Terrible
Mother.</p>
<p t="2175770" d="2670">And then the order is symbolised by the Terrible
Father.</p>
<p t="2178440" d="6050">And then the chaos that’s beyond order…
the unknown that’s beyond order and chaos,</p>
<p t="2184490" d="2070">that’s the Dragon of Chaos.</p>
<p t="2186560" d="2840">Now it’s a reptile, right, a reptilian carnivore.</p>
<p t="2189400" d="3890">It’s a reptilian carnivore that has a variety
of interesting properties.</p>
<p t="2193290" d="6270">So let me show you some of the pictures that
I’ve got of the dragon of chaos.</p>
<p t="2199560" d="3370">This is a good one.</p>
<p t="2202930" d="4320">So that’s a figure called an ‘Ouroboros’,
and you can say in some sense that that’s</p>
<p t="2207250" d="2860">one of the first graphical representations
of the infinite.</p>
<p t="2210110" d="6490">You know, we have a symbol for infinity, right,
which is another thing that’s pretty weird</p>
<p t="2216600" d="4170">to symbolise, because you’re encapsulating
something that can’t be encapsulated inside</p>
<p t="2220770" d="1300">a capsule, right.</p>
<p t="2222070" d="2010">It’s very sneaky to be able to do that.</p>
<p t="2224080" d="3750">And you actually need it to do advanced mathematics
of all sorts of kinds.</p>
<p t="2227830" d="5510">So it’s real, at least insofar as you can
use it as a tool.</p>
<p t="2233340" d="4540">So let me tell you a few things about this
symbol, this representation.</p>
<p t="2237880" d="6480">It’s kind of like the Judeo-Christian idea
of God being the Alpha and Omega.</p>
<p t="2244360" d="4870">Which is this thing that exists from the beginning
of time all the way to the end of time.</p>
<p t="2249230" d="3700">So it’s something that exists outside of
time.</p>
<p t="2252930" d="6570">So you could think about this, at one level,
as the eternal presence of The Predator.</p>
<p t="2259500" d="4580">Predators come and go; The Predator never
goes away.</p>
<p t="2264080" d="4460">So it’s got this God-like… you could say
the spirit of The Predator never disappears.</p>
<p t="2268540" d="3890">And as soon as you think that way then you
have some idea about what archaic people were</p>
<p t="2272430" d="2900">doing when they were populating the world
with spirits.</p>
<p t="2275330" d="5740">The difference between a spirit and an abstract
idea is like, there’s no difference.</p>
<p t="2281070" d="2770">The spirit of The Predator inhabits the jungle.</p>
<p t="2283840" d="2360">It’s like, yeah, that’s for sure.</p>
<p t="2286200" d="3690">And you should be very careful of disturbing
such spirits when you go in there.</p>
<p t="2289890" d="3380">Well so then you might ask yourself, well,
what is a predator?</p>
<p t="2293270" d="7190">Well, that’s a complicated thing, because
we would say, because we’re scientifically-minded,</p>
<p t="2300460" d="5570">that you can take predators and you can classify
according to their species and their sub-species</p>
<p t="2306030" d="4410">and their phyla and all that sort of thing,
right.</p>
<p t="2310440" d="3620">We think about classifying them as objects,
and then maybe in terms of their evolutionary</p>
<p t="2314060" d="1000">origins.</p>
<p t="2315060" d="2770">But that’s not very helpful.</p>
<p t="2317830" d="5260">You know, if something jumps out and wants
to eat you, I mean, knowing what it is might</p>
<p t="2323090" d="3840">help you plot your escape but all those additional
complexities, they’re just not the relevant</p>
<p t="2326930" d="1270">issue at that point.</p>
<p t="2328200" d="5580">The relevant issue is, how do you keep the
predators away from your explored territory?</p>
<p t="2333780" d="9220">Well, now that’s a complicated question,
because you might say: what do you mean by</p>
<p t="2343000" d="1000">that?</p>
<p t="2344000" d="2200">Do you mean right now, while you’re walking
through the bush?</p>
<p t="2346200" d="5450">Do you mean right now for you and your family,
while all of you are walking through the bush?</p>
<p t="2351650" d="5480">There’s this old joke about these two guys
that go out in the forest, and one guy says</p>
<p t="2357130" d="6610">to the other: “There’s grizzly bears here,
so you have to be careful.”</p>
<p t="2363740" d="5080">And then the other guy says, “Well, how
fast can you run?”</p>
<p t="2368820" d="5360">And the first guy says “Well, don’t you
mean how fast does the grizzly bear run?”</p>
<p t="2374180" d="4251">And the other guy says “No that isn’t
what I mean I just want to know if I can run</p>
<p t="2378431" d="1219">faster than you.”</p>
<p t="2379650" d="1000">[Laughter].</p>
<p t="2380650" d="1040">Right, right.</p>
<p t="2381690" d="6960">So the reason I’m telling you that stupid
joke is because what you want as an answer</p>
<p t="2388650" d="4450">to a question depends on exactly how you put
the question.</p>
<p t="2393100" d="5390">And so, the answer there was “well I don’t
care if the grizzly bear eats someone as long</p>
<p t="2398490" d="1000">as it’s not me.”</p>
<p t="2399490" d="2050">Okay, fine, so that’s one answer to the
question.</p>
<p t="2401540" d="5470">But then you might think, well let’s keep
the grizzly bears away from me now, my family</p>
<p t="2407010" d="9600">now, my tribe now, me tomorrow, my family
tomorrow, my tribe tomorrow, then across the</p>
<p t="2416610" d="4140">week, then across the month, then across the
years, then maybe forever.</p>
<p t="2420750" d="3750">Okay so how is it that you have to act so
that you keep the predators away?</p>
<p t="2424500" d="4070">Well, that starts to become an extraordinarily
complicated problem.</p>
<p t="2428570" d="4320">Because the simple solution might be, well
when there’s a predator around, climb a</p>
<p t="2432890" d="3730">tree or run into a hole, which is what lots
of animals do.</p>
<p t="2436620" d="1860">But it’s a pretty partial solution.</p>
<p t="2438480" d="4880">They don’t get eaten that day, but what
about tomorrow, when the predator’s a little</p>
<p t="2443360" d="1000">hungrier.</p>
<p t="2444360" d="3290">It’s kind of a bone-headed solution, all
things considered.</p>
<p t="2447650" d="5600">So then you might say, well, if we thought
of the spirit of the predator, which is more</p>
<p t="2453250" d="6990">like the fact that there is a class of predators
and they’re never going to go away, then</p>
<p t="2460240" d="4890">the question that we have to answer is, how
do we act so that that class that’s eternal</p>
<p t="2465130" d="2510">doesn’t bother us any more than necessary?</p>
<p t="2467640" d="2290">Well that’s really complicated.</p>
<p t="2469930" d="2590">Really, really complicated.</p>
<p t="2472520" d="3140">Because it might mean, in some sense, well,
how should you act?</p>
<p t="2475660" d="6810">Because conquering the problem of having your
territory invaded, there’s not just reptilian</p>
<p t="2482470" d="5220">and mammalian predators, right, like bird-things
with teeth, there’s other people.</p>
<p t="2487690" d="4200">And they’re a lot worse than anything else
that’s going to come at you, so you also</p>
<p t="2491890" d="4460">have that problem, how do you keep yourself
away from the predatory people and the foreign</p>
<p t="2496350" d="4040">tribes that are going to invade your land
and take it.</p>
<p t="2500390" d="6270">So there’s no difference between that question
and how do you establish the security of a</p>
<p t="2506660" d="1810">nation, roughly speaking.</p>
<p t="2508470" d="2380">Or maybe even how do you establish peace?</p>
<p t="2510850" d="1000">You know what I mean?</p>
<p t="2511850" d="3060">It’s a question that doesn’t have obvious
borders.</p>
<p t="2514910" d="4360">Okay, so one answer might be, stay away from
the damn predators.</p>
<p t="2519270" d="3660">So you build a big wall, or someone else does,
and you hide inside the walls.</p>
<p t="2522930" d="4490">Well, that’s not a bad solution, and of
course, that’s what people started to do</p>
<p t="2527420" d="1510">when they originally built cities, right?</p>
<p t="2528930" d="6720">They built these big walls, like Trump is
going to build between Canada and the US,</p>
<p t="2535650" d="1680">and it’ll keep the predators out.</p>
<p t="2537330" d="5550">But of course, what do we know from the story
of Genesis, and from the Daoist symbol?</p>
<p t="2542880" d="3440">No matter how big the wall is, you can’t
keep out the damn snakes.</p>
<p t="2546320" d="5500">So you build a wall and all the snakes pop
up inside, so it’s not a very good solution.</p>
<p t="2551820" d="2270">And you know, that’s pretty obvious, right?</p>
<p t="2554090" d="6100">I mean, my suspicions are that mass shooters
who are native to the United States kill a</p>
<p t="2560190" d="4630">lot more people in the US every week than
illegal Mexican immigrants.</p>
<p t="2564820" d="10730">Well, so it’s like, what problem exactly
are you solving?</p>
<p t="2575550" d="9780">Okay, so the first question you have to solve
when you’re… see there’s just no solution</p>
<p t="2585330" d="11250">to this problem [open doors in the classroom?][Laughter].</p>
<p t="2596580" d="9190">So, why did you laugh at that, do you think?</p>
<p t="2605770" d="2360">[Student: Because it opened again and it was
unexpected?]</p>
<p t="2608130" d="1790">Yeah, but why didn’t that terrify you?</p>
<p t="2609920" d="3760">Well, you know, it’s related to the hierarchy
issue, right?</p>
<p t="2613680" d="1980">Because the door isn’t behaving properly.</p>
<p t="2615660" d="1680">So what’s funny about that?</p>
<p t="2617340" d="8000">Well, it’s funny to watch someone’s little
routine not work when the consequences are</p>
<p t="2625340" d="1000">trivial.</p>
<p t="2626340" d="1970">It’s like, oh well he knows how to close
the door.</p>
<p t="2628310" d="1000">Hahaha it’s not working.</p>
<p t="2629310" d="3600">So now he’s got the problem of this door
and that’s a stupid problem, so everyone</p>
<p t="2632910" d="2910">can laugh about it, you know?</p>
<p t="2635820" d="6730">So, little anomalies, that you can bind quickly,
are common.</p>
<p t="2642550" d="4190">And I think it’s an indication, to tell
you the truth, I think it’s an indication</p>
<p t="2646740" d="2790">of people’s transcendent ability.</p>
<p t="2649530" d="3300">Because what happens, comedians do this with
you too, you know.</p>
<p t="2652830" d="3321">So you’ll be sitting in the audience, and
the comedian will say this thing and then</p>
<p t="2656151" d="3219">this thing, and they’re connected in some
way, but it’s not obvious.</p>
<p t="2659370" d="1720">And then you go, click!</p>
<p t="2661090" d="3550">And it’s like everybody celebrates their
brilliance together, like “Oh I get it!</p>
<p t="2664640" d="1000">Hahaha!</p>
<p t="2665640" d="1200">Aren’t I smart?”</p>
<p t="2666840" d="5190">And it transforms you from the puzzled thing
into the solving thing.</p>
<p t="2672030" d="1280">And everyone really likes that.</p>
<p t="2673310" d="1000">It’s like, “Yes!</p>
<p t="2674310" d="1000">We solved it.</p>
<p t="2675310" d="2420">We can go and combat the unknown together.”</p>
<p t="2677730" d="5800">Okay, so you have this chaos thing here [points
to figure].</p>
<p t="2683530" d="3030">As I said, that’s called an Ouroboros.</p>
<p t="2686560" d="5970">The reason it’s got its tail in its mouth
is… it’s a… the idea that that’s trying</p>
<p t="2692530" d="2980">to represent is that this thing is complete
unto itself.</p>
<p t="2695510" d="3010">So it’s a symbol of totality.</p>
<p t="2698520" d="2080">It’s everything.</p>
<p t="2700600" d="1040">How?</p>
<p t="2701640" d="4270">Well, you walk into the room where your interview
is.</p>
<p t="2705910" d="1410">You might say, what’s in there?</p>
<p t="2707320" d="3400">Well a better question is, what’s not in
there?</p>
<p t="2710720" d="4870">That’s a better question, because your whole
damn future’s in there.</p>
<p t="2715590" d="1930">And you don’t even know how much that branches.</p>
<p t="2717520" d="1430">Your future’s in there.</p>
<p t="2718950" d="3910">The future of your children is in there.</p>
<p t="2722860" d="1000">The future of your grandchildren is in there.</p>
<p t="2723860" d="3950">There’s these waves that go out from that
room that in some sense, especially if you</p>
<p t="2727810" d="4140">stretch them forward in time, have almost
no boundary.</p>
<p t="2731950" d="3490">You know, I mean, I don’t know, each of
us is descended from one person.</p>
<p t="2735440" d="3900">I don’t remember how many millions of years
ago, but it’s not that many.</p>
<p t="2739340" d="1250">Two?</p>
<p t="2740590" d="2040">Maybe it’s even earlier than that.</p>
<p t="2742630" d="1000">650,000 years?</p>
<p t="2743630" d="1000">Something like that.</p>
<p t="2744630" d="4280">So for all you know, one of you could be the
person through whom the entire human race</p>
<p t="2748910" d="4510">lived, and maybe it’s because you made the
right decision in that interview.</p>
<p t="2753420" d="4870">My point is that potential itself has no boundary,
no obvious boundary.</p>
<p t="2758290" d="2560">And you don’t know what you’re messing
with when you’re messing with it.</p>
<p t="2760850" d="1750">It’s very, very complicated.</p>
<p t="2762600" d="2420">So how should you do it?</p>
<p t="2765020" d="4100">Well, this figure says, well you better watch
out, because some of it is predatory, and</p>
<p t="2769120" d="4090">it crawls along the ground, and it’s got
teeth, and it’s no damn joke.</p>
<p t="2773210" d="5580">And then you can think it’s sort of snake-like,
because snakes sneak around through the grass.</p>
<p t="2778790" d="4000">And then it’s sort of crocodile-like, because
snakes don’t have teeth but crocodiles sure</p>
<p t="2782790" d="2260">the hell do, and so do other predatory lizards.</p>
<p t="2785050" d="6870">And you know, as we’ve talked about before,
the probability that our ancestral plains-dwelling</p>
<p t="2791920" d="5110">African ancestors were regularly lunched upon
by crocodiles is pretty damn high.</p>
<p t="2797030" d="1780">Because how else would they get water?</p>
<p t="2798810" d="4200">And you’ve got to be pretty mean before
you can take on a Nile crocodile.</p>
<p t="2803010" d="4660">I mean, I’m sure we did that fairly early
in our evolutionary history, but before that</p>
<p t="2807670" d="2560">a lot of us were snacks for lizards.</p>
<p t="2810230" d="6620">Which seems… just not good, you know?</p>
<p t="2816850" d="3950">So this thing also lives in a hole, dragons
usually live in holes or underground, like</p>
<p t="2820800" d="1700">Harry Potter’s basilisk.</p>
<p t="2822500" d="1270">And usually they’re immortal.</p>
<p t="2823770" d="2360">They live in a cave, they’re immortal, right?</p>
<p t="2826130" d="2960">They live forever, and you don’t want to
bother them, because then they pop out of</p>
<p t="2829090" d="3380">their hole, like they do in The Hobbit, and
they come and burn down your village.</p>
<p t="2832470" d="2420">It’s like, leave the damn dragon alone.</p>
<p t="2834890" d="2250">Well, yes and no.</p>
<p t="2837140" d="2820">Why not leave it alone?</p>
<p t="2839960" d="4290">Well, maybe it would be better to go get the
dragon before it gets you.</p>
<p t="2844250" d="1930">That’s certainly possible.</p>
<p t="2846180" d="4220">And then there’s this other weird thing
about dragons which is that they hoard treasure.</p>
<p t="2850400" d="3090">So maybe you can go and confront the dragon
and you get the treasure.</p>
<p t="2853490" d="2050">And the treasure basically takes two forms.</p>
<p t="2855540" d="7710">So there’s the St. George story, where the
treasure is often a trapped, young female.</p>
<p t="2863250" d="3090">And the other version is the dragon sits on
gold.</p>
<p t="2866340" d="3040">So what’s the whole idea there?</p>
<p t="2869380" d="5750">Well, maybe the best way to overcome the predator,
the spirit of the predator, is to confront</p>
<p t="2875130" d="1000">it.</p>
<p t="2876130" d="4000">Well, that’s a hell of an idea.</p>
<p t="2880130" d="3470">Then you might think, well how deep an idea
is that?</p>
<p t="2883600" d="1860">You confront the predator, you get the gold.</p>
<p t="2885460" d="5710">Well, this is that you confront infinite possibility
and you get the reward.</p>
<p t="2891170" d="3590">You encounter infinite possibility properly.</p>
<p t="2894760" d="2860">You derive from it the rewards that it offers.</p>
<p t="2897620" d="3580">What are the rewards that infinite possibility
offers?</p>
<p t="2901200" d="2400">Who knows?</p>
<p t="2903600" d="1000">We have no idea.</p>
<p t="2904600" d="4750">And it’s so interesting, because we live
at a time in history where that’s literally</p>
<p t="2909350" d="1000">true.</p>
<p t="2910350" d="5220">Like I would hesitate to predict anything
about fifty years from now.</p>
<p t="2915570" d="3420">I quit worrying about the future about twenty
years ago.</p>
<p t="2918990" d="2640">Because I thought, oh, I get it.</p>
<p t="2921630" d="4120">No matter what happens, the probability that
it’s something I predict is zero.</p>
<p t="2925750" d="3800">So it’s like, whatever you’re worried
about, well, go ahead and worry about it,</p>
<p t="2929550" d="2260">but something completely different is going
to happen.</p>
<p t="2931810" d="2800">So it’s not really all that useful.</p>
<p t="2934610" d="4390">You should just be ready for whatever comes,
because here it comes.</p>
<p t="2939000" d="5450">You know, like I think we’ll have fully-functional
autonomous robots within three or four years.</p>
<p t="2944450" d="3400">And that’s a real game-changer.</p>
<p t="2947850" d="3070">And God only knows what’s going to happen
after that.</p>
<p t="2950920" d="6500">Transplantable organs… those things are…
you can print those on 3D printers already.</p>
<p t="2957420" d="2980">Well, augmented intelligence.</p>
<p t="2960400" d="2240">You all have augmented intelligence already.</p>
<p t="2962640" d="1000">What good are facts?</p>
<p t="2963640" d="2620">You just look them up, right?</p>
<p t="2966260" d="3970">Everyone’s an infinite supply of facts.</p>
<p t="2970230" d="7990">[Student: Can you explain, in different words,
why the dragon is eating its own tail?]</p>
<p t="2978220" d="2200">Because it has everything it needs.</p>
<p t="2980420" d="2510">That’s another way of thinking about it.</p>
<p t="2982930" d="2770">So it’s self-contained.</p>
<p t="2985700" d="4850">It doesn’t need anything outside of itself,
and there isn’t anything outside of itself.</p>
<p t="2990550" d="3540">So it doesn’t rely on anything to exist.</p>
<p t="2994090" d="1410">That’s another way of thinking about it.</p>
<p t="2995500" d="1320">It’s just there.</p>
<p t="2996820" d="7130">And so there’s an echo there of the idea
that… of an idea of beyond time.</p>
<p t="3003950" d="3451">Or I don’t know so much beyond space, but
certainly beyond time.</p>
<p t="3007401" d="3099">Time has no effect on it.</p>
<p t="3010500" d="3330">So it’s beyond time, in that sense.</p>
<p t="3013830" d="1000">Yeah?</p>
<p t="3014830" d="5460">[Student: There’s another reason it has
its tail in its mouth.</p>
<p t="3020290" d="6200">And that’s because it represents the border
between the known world, in all its goodness</p>
<p t="3026490" d="2050">and badness, and the unknown world.</p>
<p t="3028540" d="4450">And that border can get smaller as it eats
more of its tail.]</p>
<p t="3032990" d="1020">Mhm, right, right.</p>
<p t="3034010" d="5070">Okay, so, now it has wings, why does it have
wings?</p>
<p t="3039080" d="4270">Well, this is another horribly complicated
thing.</p>
<p t="3043350" d="2420">I’ll show you a diagram.</p>
<p t="3045770" d="3690">This is the closest I’ve been able to get
to it.</p>
<p t="3049460" d="16440">I often don’t talk about this diagram, but
I guess I am today.</p>
<p t="3065900" d="20420">Yeah, okay, we might as well go through this
completely.</p>
<p t="3086320" d="9590">Okay so here’s you.</p>
<p t="3095910" d="6180">So if you look right in the middle there,
here I’ll make it bigger so that you can</p>
<p t="3102090" d="3440">see it.</p>
<p t="3105530" d="1580">You kind of think that you’re right here.</p>
<p t="3107110" d="2530">This is where your consciousness normally
sits.</p>
<p t="3109640" d="4140">Like, you know, are you yourself, that’s
sort of your conscious body envelope and all</p>
<p t="3113780" d="1890">that, or are you your family?</p>
<p t="3115670" d="5660">Well you know, the border there is rather
pliable.</p>
<p t="3121330" d="4130">Well then, you can drill down into the cell,
and this is sort of the idea of hierarchy.</p>
<p t="3125460" d="5090">You know, you can look at principles, so those
are your general philosophical beliefs and</p>
<p t="3130550" d="5590">then your programs, and the sequence of behaviours
that you instantiate that in and then your</p>
<p t="3136140" d="1000">behaviours.</p>
<p t="3137140" d="5160">And then you can go below that even and you
can think of yourself as… well because when</p>
<p t="3142300" d="3230">you’re behaving, what’s under that?</p>
<p t="3145530" d="1860">What’s the support for that?</p>
<p t="3147390" d="1000">The platform for that?</p>
<p t="3148390" d="1310">Well it’s your body, right?</p>
<p t="3149700" d="1300">Well, what’s there?</p>
<p t="3151000" d="3990">Well, once you get past the level of arm,
it’s sort of like musculature.</p>
<p t="3154990" d="4910">And then you might say, what’s under that,
what’s next?</p>
<p t="3159900" d="4820">Well you have your cellular structure, and
so that’s what cellular biologists study,</p>
<p t="3164720" d="2000">God that’s so complex.</p>
<p t="3166720" d="3160">And then below that you have your molecular
structures, like DNA, and then underneath</p>
<p t="3169880" d="1000">that there’s the atomic structure.</p>
<p t="3170880" d="6490">And then underneath that there’s the sub-atomic
structure, and what are you going to say about</p>
<p t="3177370" d="1000">that?</p>
<p t="3178370" d="6450">There isn’t even time at that level.</p>
<p t="3184820" d="1810">And then you can do the same thing if you
go up.</p>
<p t="3186630" d="3970">It’s like, people say you shouldn’t just
pay attention to your family, you’re in</p>
<p t="3190600" d="1730">a cultural group, they’re important too.</p>
<p t="3192330" d="3920">And well, what about the biological group
that that’s nested in, and maybe you should</p>
<p t="3196250" d="3990">be paying more attention to the ecosystem
rather than to yourself.</p>
<p t="3200240" d="6040">And you know, you shade upward into this thing
that you can’t really dissociate yourself</p>
<p t="3206280" d="2510">from either.</p>
<p t="3208790" d="4660">So that’s what you are, make no mistake
about it.</p>
<p t="3213450" d="6660">Your consciousness is such that you only are
located, in some sense, at one level of observation,</p>
<p t="3220110" d="1940">and God only knows why that is.</p>
<p t="3222050" d="7310">It’s almost as if being has to come to a
pinpoint in order for things to exist.</p>
<p t="3229360" d="4250">The way I’ve been thinking about it, in
some sense, is you could take all of this</p>
<p t="3233610" d="6150">structure and you know, narrow it down to
a single point of a pencil that’s writing.</p>
<p t="3239760" d="5260">And the writing is the transformation of potential
into actuality, but in order to do that there</p>
<p t="3245020" d="6080">has to be a point of contact between you and
the potential, and that’s your body in part,</p>
<p t="3251100" d="1540">but it’s even narrower than that.</p>
<p t="3252640" d="6090">It’s whatever occupies this tiny little
laser beam of attention while you’re wandering</p>
<p t="3258730" d="1000">through the world.</p>
<p t="3259730" d="2690">And it’s like burning reality into being.</p>
<p t="3262420" d="4570">So why that is, I mean, God, who knows?</p>
<p t="3266990" d="2400">It’s beyond strange.</p>
<p t="3269390" d="6180">Now, you know, one way of thinking about this
whole structure is you could think about it</p>
<p t="3275570" d="4670">as the psychological world, because you’re
at the centre of it, or you could think about</p>
<p t="3280240" d="4440">it as the spiritual world if you think about
spirit as a matter of consciousness.</p>
<p t="3284680" d="4860">It’s not the material world anyways, or
if it is it’s the material world insofar</p>
<p t="3289540" d="3930">as it’s you as a living conscious being.</p>
<p t="3293470" d="3680">So you know, we tend to separate out consciousness
and matter, right?</p>
<p t="3297150" d="3110">I mean, I’m conscious, that’s something
weird.</p>
<p t="3300260" d="5030">We don’t think this table is so we think
of them as separate substances in a sense,</p>
<p t="3305290" d="1000">spirit and matter.</p>
<p t="3306290" d="3560">Well that’s what the dragon is: it’s half
matter, that’s the thing that’s crawling</p>
<p t="3309850" d="3410">around on the ground, and it’s half spirit,
and that’s the wings.</p>
<p t="3313260" d="6200">And then you might say, well why the hell
is the dragon half spirit and half matter?</p>
<p t="3319460" d="1760">Well we’ve got the spirit part, I just showed
you it.</p>
<p t="3321220" d="11740">So now I’m going to show you the matter
part.</p>
<p t="3332960" d="15100">Okay, so we could say, well what’s that?</p>
<p t="3348060" d="3820">Well it’s a chair.</p>
<p t="3351880" d="1380">You think, that’s pretty straightforward.</p>
<p t="3353260" d="3170">It’s actually not, and I can tell you why
pretty rapidly.</p>
<p t="3356430" d="2220">Why is it a chair?</p>
<p t="3358650" d="3000">[Student: The legs?]</p>
<p t="3361650" d="4020">How about a beanbag?</p>
<p t="3365670" d="1070">Is that a chair?</p>
<p t="3366740" d="2360">That’s right because we can sit in it!</p>
<p t="3369100" d="3110">And that seems to be the fundamental issue:
is this a chair?</p>
<p t="3372210" d="1150">Is this a chair?</p>
<p t="3373360" d="1760">[Points to desk]
[Student: It can be.]</p>
<p t="3375120" d="1000">It can be, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p t="3376120" d="2490">You’d say it’s not a canonical chair,
and neither is a beanbag.</p>
<p t="3378610" d="3200">Because a chair could be a beanbag or a stump.</p>
<p t="3381810" d="2570">But you know, that’s sort of a canonical
chair.</p>
<p t="3384380" d="5200">But part of my point is, you know, the typical
answer that people will give when you ask</p>
<p t="3389580" d="4590">“why is that a chair?” is that they’ll
lay out the objective structure, that’s</p>
<p t="3394170" d="2430">only a tiny bit of a chair.</p>
<p t="3396600" d="3760">You know, if it was that high, would it be
a chair?</p>
<p t="3400360" d="5170">It has to have the right structure and the
right function in order for it to be a chair.</p>
<p t="3405530" d="5260">And so what that means is that thing which
is an object is already only existing in relationship</p>
<p t="3410790" d="1350">to you, in some important sense.</p>
<p t="3412140" d="4290">But I could also say well, it’s part of
the classroom.</p>
<p t="3416430" d="1540">What’s the classroom part of?</p>
<p t="3417970" d="1610">Well it’s part of Sid Smith.</p>
<p t="3419580" d="1390">This chair is part of Sid Smith.</p>
<p t="3420970" d="1520">And what’s Sid Smith part of?</p>
<p t="3422490" d="1160">Well it’s part of the university.</p>
<p t="3423650" d="1720">And what’s the university part of?</p>
<p t="3425370" d="4360">Well God, it’s part of all sorts of things,
but we could say it’s a piece of the city,</p>
<p t="3429730" d="5270">it’s a chunk of the province, it’s a bit
of the country, and then it’s nested inside</p>
<p t="3435000" d="2560">a much broader civilisation than that.</p>
<p t="3437560" d="2370">So that’s sort of going up from the chair.</p>
<p t="3439930" d="4020">And you could say, well, that’s not really
a chair, and I could say, well if that thing</p>
<p t="3443950" d="5320">was floating at some point halfway between
the Sun and Pluto, I don’t think considering</p>
<p t="3449270" d="2660">it a chair would be reasonable.</p>
<p t="3451930" d="2120">Because, well for obvious reasons.</p>
<p t="3454050" d="4320">You know, you can decontextualize something
so completely that it isn’t what it is anymore.</p>
<p t="3458370" d="2430">It’s not that hard.</p>
<p t="3460800" d="3380">You know, and you kind of do that to yourself
when you say, well, who cares, why is this</p>
<p t="3464180" d="1000">important?</p>
<p t="3465180" d="1430">Who’s going to know in a million years?</p>
<p t="3466610" d="1000">Poof!</p>
<p t="3467610" d="1000">You’re decontextualized.</p>
<p t="3468610" d="2510">It’s a stupid trick, it’s like a party
trick for intellects.</p>
<p t="3471120" d="2760">It’s a stupid trick, you know?</p>
<p t="3473880" d="1590">Because anybody can do it?</p>
<p t="3475470" d="1300">And what does it mean?</p>
<p t="3476770" d="3510">It means you’re looking at it from the wrong
perspective, that’s what it means.</p>
<p t="3480280" d="2490">So it’s not like it’s an ‘ultimate question’.</p>
<p t="3482770" d="5560">You wouldn’t be able to think about it in
fifteen seconds if it was an ultimate question.</p>
<p t="3488330" d="3130">But then you could do the same thing with
the chair that you did that you did with yourself</p>
<p t="3491460" d="1480">when you zoom in to it, right?</p>
<p t="3492940" d="4470">So it’s made of parts, well obviously, and
then the parts are made out of sub-parts and</p>
<p t="3497410" d="2800">so forth, all the way down to the sub-atomic
level.</p>
<p t="3500210" d="3250">And the chair is all those things at the same
time.</p>
<p t="3503460" d="7370">Okay, so then you might say, well what do
you encounter when you encounter the unknown?</p>
<p t="3510830" d="5110">And that’s what you encounter, I think.</p>
<p t="3515940" d="1520">So let’s take a look at this.</p>
<p t="3517460" d="1530">And you can think about it.</p>
<p t="3518990" d="2070">It’s a weird idea.</p>
<p t="3521060" d="3240">Okay, so you’ve got your little frame of
reference, right?</p>
<p t="3524300" d="4140">You’re going from point A to point B. And
when you’re going from point A to point</p>
<p t="3528440" d="3450">B something that you didn’t want to happen
happens.</p>
<p t="3531890" d="3400">And we already know that it can be a little
thing that happens, and then you know, haha</p>
<p t="3535290" d="4410">it’s funny, or it can be your whole world
falls apart, and then it’s a catastrophe.</p>
<p t="3539700" d="4500">But let’s say it’s something like the
interview.</p>
<p t="3544200" d="3510">So I would say that’s sort of a mid-level
anomaly, right?</p>
<p t="3547710" d="4810">You walk in, there’s a lot in there, but
you can handle it, weirdly enough.</p>
<p t="3552520" d="3530">And I suppose that’s because there are other
places that you can go where there are potential</p>
<p t="3556050" d="4010">futures lying, so it’s not like you’re
out of potential futures just because you</p>
<p t="3560060" d="1960">walk through that.</p>
<p t="3562020" d="4140">So you say, well, what’s in that room is
anomalous, you don’t understand it.</p>
<p t="3566160" d="2670">It’s unformed matter.</p>
<p t="3568830" d="5450">Now you might say, someone might say, does
this interview matter to you?</p>
<p t="3574280" d="5740">You think, that’s a pretty weird question,
because things are made out of matter.</p>
<p t="3580020" d="2720">So what do you mean when you say does this
matter to you?</p>
<p t="3582740" d="4480">Well, partly what it means is that before
matter was our matter, it was a matter that</p>
<p t="3587220" d="3390">was more complicated, linguistically speaking.</p>
<p t="3590610" d="7080">So if you go back far enough, what people
meant by matter wasn’t this [raps on desk].</p>
<p t="3597690" d="3300">It was more like, I would say, it’s more
like potential.</p>
<p t="3600990" d="1840">Or it’s more like information.</p>
<p t="3602830" d="1720">That’s another way of thinking about it.</p>
<p t="3604550" d="3470">So you could certainly say that room is chock-full
of information.</p>
<p t="3608020" d="3680">So let’s go with the information idea, just
for the sake of argument.</p>
<p t="3611700" d="4270">We already talked about it as potential, let’s
talk about it as information, both of those</p>
<p t="3615970" d="1020">work.</p>
<p t="3616990" d="2780">You walk in there and you start interacting
with people.</p>
<p t="3619770" d="6450">And then you leave later and you know, you
tell your partner “Well I went for this</p>
<p t="3626220" d="1000">interview.”</p>
<p t="3627220" d="1000">And they say “How did it go?”</p>
<p t="3628220" d="2840">And you say “Well, it didn’t go very well
but I learned some things.”</p>
<p t="3631060" d="2090">Because you could say that, right?</p>
<p t="3633150" d="5940">Well so I would say you went into that room
and you extracted some spirit out of the potential.</p>
<p t="3639090" d="4290">Now that’s exactly how Piaget looked at
it by the way.</p>
<p t="3643380" d="4270">Well, I shouldn’t say ‘exactly’ because
it’s probably not exactly the way he looked</p>
<p t="3647650" d="1000">at it.</p>
<p t="3648650" d="4110">But basically what Piaget proclaimed with
children was that children will try out a</p>
<p t="3652760" d="5020">little routine, and then something will happen
that doesn’t fit in their little routine.</p>
<p t="3657780" d="3510">And so they’ll investigate it using whatever
tools they have at hand.</p>
<p t="3661290" d="4820">Some of it’s trial and error, and some of
it’s… you know, they try out other tool-like</p>
<p t="3666110" d="3370">embodiments of their body that have worked
in the past.</p>
<p t="3669480" d="6440">So for example, the first thing a nine-month
old will do crawling around on the floor if</p>
<p t="3675920" d="4530">it encounters something that’s roughly mouth-sized
is put it in their mouth.</p>
<p t="3680450" d="1000">Why?</p>
<p t="3681450" d="2920">Well they don’t know what it is, but they
kind of know how to use their mouth.</p>
<p t="3684370" d="3470">So they throw it into their mouth, and then
they tongue it, and they get some sense of</p>
<p t="3687840" d="3480">sort of how it tastes, which is very important,
and what its shape is and all that, because</p>
<p t="3691320" d="3970">they’re very wired up in their mouth, and
so they can investigate like mad.</p>
<p t="3695290" d="6510">And so what they encounter is a thing and
then when they throw it in their mouth they</p>
<p t="3701800" d="4380">practice doing something with it, you know,
getting its shape, so now they know something</p>
<p t="3706180" d="1000">about it.</p>
<p t="3707180" d="3680">So that changes them from a spiritual perspective,
a psychological perspective.</p>
<p t="3710860" d="4330">Now they’re slightly different than they
were, they’ve incorporated some information,</p>
<p t="3715190" d="5360">and they’ve also transformed the thing into
a specific thing with specific features.</p>
<p t="3720550" d="4250">And so what you might say is that out of potential
spirit and matter arise.</p>
<p t="3724800" d="3560">And that’s a very interesting way of looking
at it.</p>
<p t="3728360" d="3540">Also it fits well with the phenomenological
philosophers.</p>
<p t="3731900" d="10450">Because they believe that we encountered phenomena
and phenomena were those things that shone</p>
<p t="3742350" d="1000">forth.</p>
<p t="3743350" d="2560">And so that’s like a reversion to the idea
of meaning.</p>
<p t="3745910" d="4260">Because you’ve got to think about it this
way too… it’s like when you walk into</p>
<p t="3750170" d="4520">a library, God, what’s in there?</p>
<p t="3754690" d="3380">Well, it’s inexhaustible, a library.</p>
<p t="3758070" d="1970">Well, how come you just don’t get exhausted?</p>
<p t="3760040" d="4770">Well, it’s because you’re not actually
interacting with the whole library.</p>
<p t="3764810" d="4860">You’ve got this focal point like a laser
again, and you’ve made it into a focal point</p>
<p t="3769670" d="3180">because you’re inside that hierarchical
structure, right?</p>
<p t="3772850" d="3940">So you say, well I’m in the library to get
this book, I’m getting this book to read</p>
<p t="3776790" d="1270">this chapter.</p>
<p t="3778060" d="2070">So chapter, book, library.</p>
<p t="3780130" d="5290">I’m going to university, I need to become
educated and get a job so I’ll be a good</p>
<p t="3785420" d="1390">citizen and a good person.</p>
<p t="3786810" d="1870">And so that’s what you’re doing in the
library.</p>
<p t="3788680" d="2030">You’re just doing one little fragment of
that.</p>
<p t="3790710" d="4682">And the more you have that whole model developed,
right, all the way from good person all the</p>
<p t="3795392" d="4948">way down to why you’re in the library, the
more precise your aim is, the more you know</p>
<p t="3800340" d="4180">what you’re doing, the less encumbered by
doubt and uncertainty you are, and the higher</p>
<p t="3804520" d="6700">probability you have of focusing on your task
and then writing the path that you want to</p>
<p t="3811220" d="1220">be into being.</p>
<p t="3812440" d="4710">And so, well, so it’s very useful to think
about things this way and it’s also very</p>
<p t="3817150" d="2230">interesting to note that that’s how you
act.</p>
<p t="3819380" d="2410">You actually act like the world is made this
way.</p>
<p t="3821790" d="4380">And it’s even weirder because, and this
is the case I made for you when we were talking</p>
<p t="3826170" d="1860">about the structure of the brain.</p>
<p t="3828030" d="4880">It actually looks like this is how your brain
construes the world.</p>
<p t="3832910" d="3480">Because you have systems, you’ve got a system
that works when you know what you’re doing</p>
<p t="3836390" d="3070">and you’ve got the other system that works
when you don’t know what you’re doing.</p>
<p t="3839460" d="5380">And so basically the world is divided, just
like the Daoists say, into the orderly domain</p>
<p t="3844840" d="1650">and the chaotic domain.</p>
<p t="3846490" d="3920">And you need to know how to operate in both,
and you need to balance them.</p>
<p t="3850410" d="1930">And you need to transform one into the other.</p>
<p t="3852340" d="3870">And that’s basically what you’re doing
when you’re interacting with reality.</p>
<p t="3856210" d="6350">And you know, one of the things that I will
claim, and this will become more important</p>
<p t="3862560" d="4860">as the course progresses, is that when you’re
doing something meaningful, you’re doing</p>
<p t="3867420" d="1400">that properly.</p>
<p t="3868820" d="6640">And the sense of meaning that you have, is
actually an indication that your psychophysiology</p>
<p t="3875460" d="4870">is manifesting that you’re in the right
place at the right time doing the right thing.</p>
<p t="3880330" d="1570">And it’s real.</p>
<p t="3881900" d="3560">It’s not only real, it’s like it’s the
most real thing.</p>
<p t="3885460" d="5270">It’s where potential is transformed into
reality.</p>
<p t="3890730" d="2571">And it’s hard to get any more real than
that.</p>
<p t="3893301" d="4059">So that’s partly why I’m telling you that
these things aren’t exactly metaphors, you</p>
<p t="3897360" d="1000">know.</p>
<p t="3898360" d="2910">They have to be represented by metaphor in
some sense.</p>
<p t="3901270" d="5030">But the reality that’s underlying them…
it’s not just a story.</p>
<p t="3906300" d="2680">Even though it is a story, it’s not just
a story.</p>
<p t="3908980" d="3800">It’s a real representation of reality.</p>
<p t="3912780" d="4102">So, you know, the other thing I kind of outlined
here is that when you hit an anomaly… you</p>
<p t="3916882" d="7058">know an anomaly is sort of the thing from
which everything shines forth, when it’s</p>
<p t="3923940" d="4550">still really anomalous what happens is that
it manifests itself to you in sort of like</p>
<p t="3928490" d="2810">a burst of contradictory meanings.</p>
<p t="3931300" d="1990">And that can be paralysing.</p>
<p t="3933290" d="3520">You know, you could be really, really, really
excited and really, really, really nervous.</p>
<p t="3936810" d="3810">Which might happen, for example, if you were
going to a job interview and you actually</p>
<p t="3940620" d="1000">wanted the job.</p>
<p t="3941620" d="5400">It would be even worse if you went to a job
interview and like 30% of you wanted the job</p>
<p t="3947020" d="5280">because that’s the 30% of you that wants
to develop, and another 30% would just as</p>
<p t="3952300" d="3530">soon fail so that you can crawl under your
bed at home and stay there with the dust bunnies</p>
<p t="3955830" d="1000">until you’re forty.</p>
<p t="3956830" d="4990">And another 25% of you is resentful about
the fact that you have to get a stupid job</p>
<p t="3961820" d="1060">at all.</p>
<p t="3962880" d="3440">And so then you go in there and it’s really,
really complicated.</p>
<p t="3966320" d="5240">Because not only is all that potential there
but you’re fractured and those fractures</p>
<p t="3971560" d="4860">make the whole situation way more complicated
and unstable than it would otherwise have</p>
<p t="3976420" d="1120">to be.</p>
<p t="3977540" d="2840">And that happens to people all the time.</p>
<p t="3980380" d="3170">I mean, people hedge their bets in job interviews
all the time.</p>
<p t="3983550" d="2330">Because they think “eh, I don’t really
care.”</p>
<p t="3985880" d="2700">It’s like no, you care.</p>
<p t="3988580" d="3290">You just want to have a story to tell yourself
if you fail.</p>
<p t="3991870" d="3900">Well, and then if you have that story, well
then probably you’re going to fail, because</p>
<p t="3995770" d="1000">you don’t get to do that.</p>
<p t="3996770" d="3780">You can’t go in there at 60% and hope to
win.</p>
<p t="4000550" d="2060">You have to go in there at 100%.</p>
<p t="4002610" d="4671">Now that’s cool too, because what it implies
is just what the clinical psychologists have</p>
<p t="4007281" d="4989">been telling people for sixty years or seventy
years.</p>
<p t="4012270" d="3260">You have to voluntarily face the things that
you’re afraid of.</p>
<p t="4015530" d="3500">Now it’s a little more complicated than
that because otherwise you could just go play</p>
<p t="4019030" d="1530">in traffic.</p>
<p t="4020560" d="2350">So it’s not a call to stupid adventure.</p>
<p t="4022910" d="5800">What it does is assume that you’ve got a
direction and the direction is a valid direction.</p>
<p t="4028710" d="6850">And then what happens is, as you pursue that,
obstacles emerge, anomalous, threatening obstacles,</p>
<p t="4035560" d="5010">and then you either confront them, or you
abandon the whole project.</p>
<p t="4040570" d="4610">Well generally speaking if you chop them into
little pieces then you can confront them and</p>
<p t="4045180" d="1720">digest them.</p>
<p t="4046900" d="2780">And then you get stronger because you’re
doing all this digesting.</p>
<p t="4049680" d="4040">It’s like you’re eating the monster of
chaos.</p>
<p t="4053720" d="4890">And that’s a classic metaphor for developing
wisdom to ingest.</p>
<p t="4058610" d="2070">Piaget even uses that, right?</p>
<p t="4060680" d="1000">Assimilate.</p>
<p t="4061680" d="1780">It’s exactly the same idea as ingesting.</p>
<p t="4063460" d="4410">What you’re eating is information instead
of matter.</p>
<p t="4067870" d="4020">And the information restructures you and makes
you more informed.</p>
<p t="4071890" d="4380">And that puts you more in formation.</p>
<p t="4076270" d="4060">So you know you encounter the anomaly and
it’s a burst of contradictory potential,</p>
<p t="4080330" d="2600">and so that’s exactly how you respond to
it.</p>
<p t="4082930" d="4280">Your body’s going everywhere at once, because
God only knows what’s going to happen.</p>
<p t="4087210" d="2550">And then as you interact with it, it collapses.</p>
<p t="4089760" d="1000">You’re collapsing it.</p>
<p t="4090760" d="2770">That’s what happens when you take control
of the situation.</p>
<p t="4093530" d="5890">And then you reduce it to a single path where
everything is going properly.</p>
<p t="4099420" d="4920">And you might say well you’re bending it
to your own selfish will, but that’s not</p>
<p t="4104340" d="1000">right.</p>
<p t="4105340" d="2261">Because if you’re in… let’s say you’re
in an interview and there’s five or six</p>
<p t="4107601" d="4449">people in there, you can’t just bend the
damn thing to your will, because you have</p>
<p t="4112050" d="1930">to interact with those people.</p>
<p t="4113980" d="3680">And so if you don’t do that with… you
know, you could be a psychopath and manipulate,</p>
<p t="4117660" d="3850">but that’ll only work for a short period
of time, you’ll get caught, and then you’ll</p>
<p t="4121510" d="4690">have to move, because that’s what psychopaths
do, that’s how they keep being psychopaths.</p>
<p t="4126200" d="3639">They exhaust everyone’s trust and then they
have to move.</p>
<p t="4129839" d="4500">And then they go find some other people who
are trustworthy because they build up trust</p>
<p t="4134339" d="2951">capital with other people and then they betray
them.</p>
<p t="4137290" d="1000">But they have to keep moving.</p>
<p t="4138290" d="2259">So it’s an unstable solution.</p>
<p t="4140549" d="3511">So you go in there and you do it properly.</p>
<p t="4144060" d="1600">Well what are you doing exactly?</p>
<p t="4145660" d="1270">You know?</p>
<p t="4146930" d="4690">I would say that if you’re really, really
nailing that interview, you’re saying, well</p>
<p t="4151620" d="4770">here’s a future that we could all march
together into confidently and happily.</p>
<p t="4156390" d="2360">That’s what you’re saying.</p>
<p t="4158750" d="1160">And I’m the person to do that.</p>
<p t="4159910" d="2620">Now you might be saying that on a relatively
low scale.</p>
<p t="4162530" d="4550">Like, if I’m your assistant you’re never
going to have to worry about me.</p>
<p t="4167080" d="2690">Because I’m always going to be there.</p>
<p t="4169770" d="5700">And then maybe if you’re the CEO, you’re
going to say well, you know, this is the way</p>
<p t="4175470" d="3369">that all of us are going, and here’s why,
and this is what it’s going to look like.</p>
<p t="4178839" d="7201">And the better you are at that, the more that
potential will turn into… it multiplies,</p>
<p t="4186040" d="1180">that’s what happens.</p>
<p t="4187220" d="5580">If you’re good at dealing with it the potential
that’s accessible to you multiplies.</p>
<p t="4192800" d="3330">Which is really cool.</p>
<p t="4196130" d="2440">And also how you’d hope it would be.</p>
<p t="4198570" d="3410">Because you know, you’d hope that more potential
would manifest itself to people who are more</p>
<p t="4201980" d="1000">competent.</p>
<p t="4202980" d="4310">Well, if things work well that would be good.</p>
<p t="4207290" d="5940">So that’s the spirit and matter idea.</p>
<p t="4213230" d="4560">And so that’s represented in that dragon.</p>
<p t="4217790" d="9420">So let’s go back to it.</p>
<p t="4227210" d="9190">Now, okay, so you remember this character
here.</p>
<p t="4236400" d="1120">So what to do about that?</p>
<p t="4237520" d="3540">What to do about chaos?</p>
<p t="4241060" d="5650">Well one thing you might want to start by
doing is admitting that it exists.</p>
<p t="4246710" d="4510">So let’s say that you’re not a terror
management advocate.</p>
<p t="4251220" d="2680">Let’s say you’re an advocate of positive
illusions.</p>
<p t="4253900" d="1641">Does everyone know what those are?</p>
<p t="4255541" d="5919">Are you still taught about those in social
psychology, positive illusions?</p>
<p t="4261460" d="1000">Yes?</p>
<p t="4262460" d="1000">No.</p>
<p t="4263460" d="2250">How many people know about them?</p>
<p t="4265710" d="2120">Okay, where did you learn about them?</p>
<p t="4267830" d="2400">[Student: In your class, PSY230.]</p>
<p t="4270230" d="1000">In 230?</p>
<p t="4271230" d="4820">No one else has taught you about this?</p>
<p t="4276050" d="1330">Anybody else learn it anywhere else?</p>
<p t="4277380" d="1000">[Student: I learned it online.]</p>
<p t="4278380" d="1000">You learned it online.</p>
<p t="4279380" d="2260">Okay, well thank God for that.</p>
<p t="4281640" d="5840">Well, what happened was, the paper where positive
illusions were first touted, and that was</p>
<p t="4287480" d="4560">in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology,
it was the most cited… was it the most cited</p>
<p t="4292040" d="1840">paper ever in social psychology?</p>
<p t="4293880" d="1310">It’s up there.</p>
<p t="4295190" d="2180">And it’s an appalling paper!</p>
<p t="4297370" d="5900">Because it basically says… it says something
like this, if you scrape away all the nonsense:</p>
<p t="4303270" d="3570">things are so horrible that if you just looked
at them, you’ll be so depressed you’ll</p>
<p t="4306840" d="1000">want to die.</p>
<p t="4307840" d="1000">So you better not.</p>
<p t="4308840" d="4450">You better weave around yourself an illusion
that things are better than they are and that</p>
<p t="4313290" d="2980">you’re more powerful and wonderful than
you actually are.</p>
<p t="4316270" d="5140">And if you do that, but not too much, then
you’re going to be happier.</p>
<p t="4321410" d="3510">Well, you know, the errors in that are just
manifold.</p>
<p t="4324920" d="2720">First it’s like, well, who cares if you’re
happy, what the hell does that have to do</p>
<p t="4327640" d="1000">with anything?</p>
<p t="4328640" d="2550">You’d be happy stepping on ants.</p>
<p t="4331190" d="1000">[Laughter].</p>
<p t="4332190" d="1000">Well really!</p>
<p t="4333190" d="1610">It’s like what the hell stupid idea is that?</p>
<p t="4334800" d="1830">You’ve got positive emotion.</p>
<p t="4336630" d="1160">Cocaine will do that.</p>
<p t="4337790" d="3620">You know, bullies are pretty happy when they’re
pounding out someone like Milhouse.</p>
<p t="4341410" d="4220">So you know, happiness, what the hell’s
that?</p>
<p t="4345630" d="1250">It’s shallow.</p>
<p t="4346880" d="2490">It’s a dopey idea.</p>
<p t="4349370" d="4190">And then, well, how big should these lies
that you’re telling yourself be?</p>
<p t="4353560" d="3740">And the answer to that is just exactly the
size that will make you happy.</p>
<p t="4357300" d="3510">Well that’s not helpful, because if you’re
going to have a theory, let’s hear about</p>
<p t="4360810" d="1830">exactly how big they should be.</p>
<p t="4362640" d="3940">Well sometimes they should be this big and
other times they should be this big, but there’s</p>
<p t="4366580" d="2400">no real way of telling a priori.</p>
<p t="4368980" d="4320">Well so that’s not really very helpful either.</p>
<p t="4373300" d="3830">And then there’s another idea underneath
that that’s even worse, which is reality</p>
<p t="4377130" d="2370">is so awful that you can’t look at it.</p>
<p t="4379500" d="6090">Well that’s nasty man, because that means
(and that’s what the positive illusion stuff</p>
<p t="4385590" d="4310">meant, sort of like the terror management
theorists) if you got an unvarnished look</p>
<p t="4389900" d="3580">at reality, it would just destroy you.</p>
<p t="4393480" d="6560">Because you’re not strong enough to look
at reality in an unvarnished manner.</p>
<p t="4400040" d="4350">Well, you can imagine why people would believe
that.</p>
<p t="4404390" d="5790">You could think God yes, it’s pretty damn
awful.</p>
<p t="4410180" d="5550">But then you think, well wait a minute.</p>
<p t="4415730" d="5270">Is it really the case that everyone who’s
out there coping with the world is blind and</p>
<p t="4421000" d="1000">deluded?</p>
<p t="4422000" d="3300">Or maybe is it that the people who are not
coping with the world very well are blind</p>
<p t="4425300" d="1000">and deluded?</p>
<p t="4426300" d="1540">I mean, ask yourself that.</p>
<p t="4427840" d="4940">You’ve seen people in your life that you
admire, I presume, and certainly you’ve</p>
<p t="4432780" d="1860">seen people you don’t admire.</p>
<p t="4434640" d="3150">Well, so let’s take the ones you don’t
admire.</p>
<p t="4437790" d="4480">Well, how about blind and deluded, does that
partially describe them?</p>
<p t="4442270" d="2750">It would be blind, deluded, bitter, resentful,
and mean.</p>
<p t="4445020" d="3360">That sort of covers the territory.</p>
<p t="4448380" d="1860">And then the people you admire?</p>
<p t="4450240" d="3570">Well, they’re strong people, generally.</p>
<p t="4453810" d="4400">They can do things that are really, ridiculously
difficult, like have a baby, and raise it</p>
<p t="4458210" d="1540">without destroying it.</p>
<p t="4459750" d="4220">Or work in a palliative care ward or be a
nurse in a cancer ward for children.</p>
<p t="4463970" d="3530">I mean, there’s a lot of awful things.</p>
<p t="4467500" d="1560">I talked to this guy the other day.</p>
<p t="4469060" d="2210">I just met him sort of randomly.</p>
<p t="4471270" d="1510">And he had had a motorcycle accident.</p>
<p t="4472780" d="1440">And it was a bad one.</p>
<p t="4474220" d="4150">He rolled like 200 feet at 60 miles an hour
and he broke seven ribs and you know, had</p>
<p t="4478370" d="1810">a brain hemorrhage.</p>
<p t="4480180" d="1130">Like it really took it out of him.</p>
<p t="4481310" d="1510">He was a good athlete before that.</p>
<p t="4482820" d="1820">And so it probably aged him twenty years.</p>
<p t="4484640" d="2810">And he’s still recovering.</p>
<p t="4487450" d="4130">And he was telling me, he works for a power
company, and so he’s climbing up these power</p>
<p t="4491580" d="1850">poles, you know, because that’s part of
his job.</p>
<p t="4493430" d="2110">Well now he’s pretty screwed up.</p>
<p t="4495540" d="2940">He’s in his mid-fifties, he’s still climbing
up power poles.</p>
<p t="4498480" d="3130">And he was working with a guy who had Parkinson’s
disease.</p>
<p t="4501610" d="3842">And so the guy with the Parkinson’s disease
is at the top of the power pole and he’s</p>
<p t="4505452" d="1000">doing his job.</p>
<p t="4506452" d="2958">And he’s getting shaky, so they’re afraid
things are going to fall, and then this guy</p>
<p t="4509410" d="1530">comes up behind him to help him.</p>
<p t="4510940" d="2080">He’s only really got one arm that works.</p>
<p t="4513020" d="2330">It’s like, Jesus, that’s tough.</p>
<p t="4515350" d="2360">Those people are tough, man.</p>
<p t="4517710" d="1870">You know, because Parkinson’s?</p>
<p t="4519580" d="1070">That sucks.</p>
<p t="4520650" d="4360">And well, so does having half your arm more
or less destroyed by a motorcycle accident</p>
<p t="4525010" d="2970">and not staying at home hiding under the bed.</p>
<p t="4527980" d="3560">You know, they’re out there still making
sure the lights are on.</p>
<p t="4531540" d="5830">Well, that’s a pretty unvarnished confrontation
with reality as far as I’m concerned.</p>
<p t="4537370" d="6480">You know, so I could say… alright, so here’s
another story.</p>
<p t="4543850" d="6700">So, I’ve probably told you a little bit
about this before.</p>
<p t="4550550" d="5520">When the behaviourists first proposed that
you could use exposure to treat anxiety, the</p>
<p t="4556070" d="4330">psychoanalysts were all skeptical about that,
because they thought, well you’re just treating</p>
<p t="4560400" d="1160">the symptom.</p>
<p t="4561560" d="6260">They usually thought of a phobia as the manifestation,
the visible manifestation of something that</p>
<p t="4567820" d="3000">lurked more deeply underground.</p>
<p t="4570820" d="2340">And there’s real truth in that.</p>
<p t="4573160" d="5900">Like, whatever a mouse is to someone that’s
mouse-phobic isn’t what a mouse is to you.</p>
<p t="4579060" d="3401">The mouse is a bunch of other things, because
otherwise they wouldn’t be afraid of it.</p>
<p t="4582461" d="4649">And so all those… you could say the mouse
is an exemplar of the category of all things</p>
<p t="4587110" d="1140">that they’re afraid of.</p>
<p t="4588250" d="3090">And that’s a good way of thinking what that
might mean symbolically.</p>
<p t="4591340" d="4550">And so I had one client who was afraid of
mice, and she thought one would run up her</p>
<p t="4595890" d="1000">leg.</p>
<p t="4596890" d="1000">And she was also afraid of being raped.</p>
<p t="4597890" d="6640">And those two things were… there was a metaphorical
union between them, even though they’re</p>
<p t="4604530" d="2260">obviously not exactly the same.</p>
<p t="4606790" d="3720">So the psychoanalysts, they’re making their
point, you know.</p>
<p t="4610510" d="3950">But it turned out that… so the original
behavioural theory was you can’t be anxious</p>
<p t="4614460" d="2530">and calm at the same time.</p>
<p t="4616990" d="2992">So what you do first, if you’re going to
teach someone to not be afraid of a mouse,</p>
<p t="4619982" d="2148">is teach them how not to be afraid.</p>
<p t="4622130" d="4690">So you put them in a chair and you do a relaxation
exercise with them, and then you show them</p>
<p t="4626820" d="1370">a picture of a mouse.</p>
<p t="4628190" d="1920">And you say, just breathe, you know, calm
down.</p>
<p t="4630110" d="1180">And so they calm down.</p>
<p t="4631290" d="4050">And then sooner or later they can look at
the pictures of mice by themselves, and then</p>
<p t="4635340" d="5290">maybe you could throw a stuffed mouse at them,
and then maybe they could walk by a pet store</p>
<p t="4640630" d="4090">and look at a mouse, and so on and so forth,
till you get them holding rats.</p>
<p t="4644720" d="2810">And so, you know, that works.</p>
<p t="4647530" d="2500">But it works even if you don’t relax.</p>
<p t="4650030" d="3100">In fact it works just as well.</p>
<p t="4653130" d="5700">So the old behavioural idea that it was counter-conditioning
was wrong, just like the idea that the reason</p>
<p t="4658830" d="2000">that you were afraid of a rat was because
of conditioning.</p>
<p t="4660830" d="4020">It’s like, of course you’re afraid of
a rat, it’s a rat.</p>
<p t="4664850" d="5610">Just like you’re afraid of snakes, you know,
to a lesser or greater degree.</p>
<p t="4670460" d="3280">And people actually become more afraid of
snakes as they get older, interestingly enough.</p>
<p t="4673740" d="4050">Which is not what you really expect, right,
unless it was a biological function.</p>
<p t="4677790" d="5810">So anyways, all you have to do is show people
the thing they’re afraid of.</p>
<p t="4683600" d="1710">And what do they learn?</p>
<p t="4685310" d="1850">They don’t learn that the thing isn’t
frightening.</p>
<p t="4687160" d="1260">They learn that they’re tough.</p>
<p t="4688420" d="7640">And so one of the things… and that’s why
it generalises, which is… see the psychoanalysts</p>
<p t="4696060" d="2660">predicted that what would happen is, well,
you know, yeah, yeah, you’re not afraid</p>
<p t="4698720" d="5020">of a mouse anymore, but you’re twice as
afraid of being raped in your cabin when you’re</p>
<p t="4703740" d="1000">up there alone.</p>
<p t="4704740" d="2110">It’s like no, that isn’t what happens.</p>
<p t="4706850" d="3510">You’re not afraid of the mouse anymore and
you’re half as afraid of being alone up</p>
<p t="4710360" d="1190">in your cabin.</p>
<p t="4711550" d="1000">It generalises.</p>
<p t="4712550" d="4090">And so if you take someone who’s agoraphobic
and they’re in their mid-forties, and somewhat</p>
<p t="4716640" d="3810">dependent, and you treat them for agoraphobia,
then they’ll go home and give their husband</p>
<p t="4720450" d="3250">hell (because they’re usually women), and
tell them all the things that they’ve been</p>
<p t="4723700" d="2770">wanting to tell them for twenty years but
have been too afraid to because they thought</p>
<p t="4726470" d="1000">he might leave.</p>
<p t="4727470" d="3830">And then they were afraid that he’d leave
and they’d fall apart and all of that.</p>
<p t="4731300" d="4470">So they get… you teach them that they don’t
have to run out of a subway and all of a sudden</p>
<p t="4735770" d="1000">they get more confrontational.</p>
<p t="4736770" d="3430">And the reason for that is because they get
more courageous.</p>
<p t="4740200" d="4730">And the reason for that is they go do something
difficult and they watch themselves and hey,</p>
<p t="4744930" d="1400">they could do it.</p>
<p t="4746330" d="5130">And so one of the things you might ask about
yourself is, how do you know what you have</p>
<p t="4751460" d="2240">to run away from?</p>
<p t="4753700" d="3630">You know, you might be so damn tough you just
can’t bloody well imagine it, and you’re</p>
<p t="4757330" d="1530">just sort of sheltered.</p>
<p t="4758860" d="6700">Now, look, you’re a lot less sheltered than
you were when you were three, I presume.</p>
<p t="4765560" d="2110">How many of you live on your own?</p>
<p t="4767670" d="3640">Okay, now, that was a transition, I presume.</p>
<p t="4771310" d="3690">How many of you were depressed and anxious
their first year of university?</p>
<p t="4775000" d="2990">Okay, how many of you weren’t?</p>
<p t="4777990" d="4090">Okay, so it’s about 50%.</p>
<p t="4782080" d="1000">Well that’s about right.</p>
<p t="4783080" d="3940">About a third of first-year UofT meet clinical
criteria for depression according to the Beck</p>
<p t="4787020" d="1000">Depression Inventory.</p>
<p t="4788020" d="1000">Well why?</p>
<p t="4789020" d="1020">Well it’s hard.</p>
<p t="4790040" d="3550">You know, you leave your family, you’re
kind of protected there, you go out, you have</p>
<p t="4793590" d="3440">to figure out all the things you have to do
to keep yourself alive and then you have to</p>
<p t="4797030" d="2850">go to university and they’re going to give
you an impossible amount of work that no one</p>
<p t="4799880" d="2310">could ever possibly master.</p>
<p t="4802190" d="1000">So it’s daunting.</p>
<p t="4803190" d="3110">And then you’re surrounded by people who
are smarter than the people you’re used</p>
<p t="4806300" d="1040">to being surrounded by.</p>
<p t="4807340" d="1850">So that means that you’re not as smart as
you thought you were.</p>
<p t="4809190" d="3870">And then you meet people now and then who
are way smarter than you and way harder-working</p>
<p t="4813060" d="1900">and way better-looking and all of those things.</p>
<p t="4814960" d="3000">So you know, it’s depressing.</p>
<p t="4817960" d="5980">But by the same token, how many of you feel
less armed to take on the world than you did</p>
<p t="4823940" d="1140">five years ago?</p>
<p t="4825080" d="4030">You’re not going to admit it, probably,
but I presume that that’s a very small number.</p>
<p t="4829110" d="2110">How many of you feel more prepared?</p>
<p t="4831220" d="2890">Okay, okay, so that’s pretty cool.</p>
<p t="4834110" d="3280">So what that means is that you went out there
and did a whole bunch of difficult things.</p>
<p t="4837390" d="4620">And some of those things… you’ve been
reading each other’s autobiographies right?</p>
<p t="4842010" d="1570">How’s that going?</p>
<p t="4843580" d="2100">Has it been interesting?</p>
<p t="4845680" d="2630">Yeah, has it been worthwhile?</p>
<p t="4848310" d="1230">Anybody think it isn’t worthwhile?</p>
<p t="4849540" d="4690">I really want to know, you know, because it’s
kind of an experiment, in some sense, to see</p>
<p t="4854230" d="1000">how this is working.</p>
<p t="4855230" d="1000">What’s good about it?</p>
<p t="4856230" d="6320">[Student: That you can get to know a stranger
on the deepest level possible.]</p>
<p t="4862550" d="3260">So why do you like that?</p>
<p t="4865810" d="4360">[Student: Because it makes the class feel
more…]</p>
<p t="4870170" d="4190">Yeah you know I’m thinking about working
with a company in Edmonton that is setting</p>
<p t="4874360" d="5910">that up as a way of increasing trust among
people who work together in the same company.</p>
<p t="4880270" d="3940">They’re not really sharing their deepest
secrets, but what they will be doing is having</p>
<p t="4884210" d="3860">structured conversations where they find out
a little bit about each other.</p>
<p t="4888070" d="4460">You know, and it’s sort of… it seems like
to have a relationship with someone you have</p>
<p t="4892530" d="2010">to get to know their hierarchical structure,
right?</p>
<p t="4894540" d="5430">And it’s just like… like the tiniest things
while that person sits at the desk and types,</p>
<p t="4899970" d="2310">well, it’s a shallow relationship.</p>
<p t="4902280" d="4410">And if it’s a deep relationship you know
much more about the whole structure, right?</p>
<p t="4906690" d="3400">Which is I think why the metaphor of depth
works so well.</p>
<p t="4910090" d="2601">Okay, so you feel like it catalysed the classroom
a little bit more, is that right?</p>
<p t="4912691" d="10309">[Student: Yeah, and isn’t it like you fall
in love with someone… this isn’t about</p>
<p t="4923000" d="5050">falling in love, but you fall in love with
someone when they’re vulnerable?]</p>
<p t="4928050" d="3360">Yeah so that’s interesting too eh about
the whole vulnerability issue.</p>
<p t="4931410" d="6020">Yeah it’s like, if you’re forming a relationship
with someone what you do is you basically</p>
<p t="4937430" d="3220">mutually open up your shells you know.</p>
<p t="4940650" d="3600">Or basically you kind of go like this [opens
and closes hands].</p>
<p t="4944250" d="2940">And if it has to close permanently well then
you go.</p>
<p t="4947190" d="4600">Yeah well that’s another interesting thing
too because what it implies is that unless,</p>
<p t="4951790" d="6080">you know, you voluntarily expose your vulnerabilities
you’ll never find a partner, or they won’t</p>
<p t="4957870" d="2510">be a real partner because they don’t know
who the hell you are.</p>
<p t="4960380" d="1430">And then you’re weak because there’s only
one of you.</p>
<p t="4961810" d="1000">Yeah?</p>
<p t="4962810" d="5460">[Student: And the beauty in that is that it’s
completely anonymous too.]</p>
<p t="4968270" d="1590">Yeah and so why do you like that?</p>
<p t="4969860" d="7350">[Student: Because I can share my deepest secrets
but not feel like anyone will…]</p>
<p t="4977210" d="4500">You know there’s some evidence that people
like computer-guided psychotherapy.</p>
<p t="4981710" d="2161">For exactly that reason.</p>
<p t="4983871" d="3359">You can be completely honest with the computer
because it doesn’t care.</p>
<p t="4987230" d="1000">Not yet.</p>
<p t="4988230" d="4930">It will soon but, but it probably won’t
judge you any more harshly than you set it</p>
<p t="4993160" d="1000">to.</p>
<p t="4994160" d="3340">It’s like, love and affection today.</p>
<p t="4997500" d="1000">[Laughter].</p>
<p t="4998500" d="2070">Yeah, well that won’t be very far away.</p>
<p t="5000570" d="3110">Okay so what do other people have to say about
the autobiography?</p>
<p t="5003680" d="1000">Yeah?</p>
<p t="5004680" d="1000">[Student: I found it really interesting because
I never personally know so deeply what another</p>
<p t="5005680" d="5480">person thinks, because we don’t share that
much… we talk about the beginning of childhood</p>
<p t="5011160" d="11570">up to this point, we never really have that
conversation with anyone else.]</p>
<p t="5022730" d="1430">So you like that too.</p>
<p t="5024160" d="2320">[Student: Yeah I like it a lot.]</p>
<p t="5026480" d="1000">Why?</p>
<p t="5027480" d="1000">What was good about it for you?</p>
<p t="5028480" d="1160">[Student: Usually as we move through stages
in our life we only interact with our age,</p>
<p t="5029640" d="2200">we never see them holistically.</p>
<p t="5031840" d="9580">But watching them grow, it’s kind of like,
very strange, because we don’t see people</p>
<p t="5041420" d="1280">that way.]</p>
<p t="5042700" d="3370">Right, well you’re seeing more of this eh?</p>
<p t="5046070" d="1089">[Points to Ouroboros image].</p>
<p t="5047159" d="4721">Because the person actually extends across
time, and you’re right, all you see is a</p>
<p t="5051880" d="1000">slice.</p>
<p t="5052880" d="4440">Well they’re not a slice, they’re a whole
damn thing, this thing that grows across time.</p>
<p t="5057320" d="3870">Okay, who else has something to say that’s
interesting?</p>
<p t="5061190" d="1000">[Laughter].</p>
<p t="5062190" d="4090">Haha, half the people don’t want to talk
now.</p>
<p t="5066280" d="1640">So, anybody else?</p>
<p t="5067920" d="4100">[Student: After doing that and writing so
many things about myself, I was actually talking</p>
<p t="5072020" d="5260">about the assignment with a couple of my friends,
and I really thought, I’d actually be okay</p>
<p t="5077280" d="6050">if the people who read my assignment identified
who I was and like, even engaged in conversation</p>
<p t="5083330" d="1760">with me.</p>
<p t="5085090" d="8120">And it really inspired me to be more honest
about sharing myself in my existing relationships.]</p>
<p t="5093210" d="4730">So why did you conclude that it would be okay
if someone identified you?</p>
<p t="5097940" d="4550">[Student: Because I felt a desire to be seen
more.</p>
<p t="5102490" d="1980">And it was kind of…</p>
<p t="5104470" d="3780">I felt more with myself when I was disclosing
more information about myself.</p>
<p t="5108250" d="7220">And so it made me want to be more with myself
in my existing relationships.]</p>
<p t="5115470" d="1810">Okay, that was a very good observation.</p>
<p t="5117280" d="3960">I’m going to say a couple of things about
that and you tell me if you think they’re</p>
<p t="5121240" d="1000">accurate.</p>
<p t="5122240" d="4990">Okay so the first thing is, it’s an act
of courage to, haha, expose yourself to someone…</p>
<p t="5127230" d="2970">no we’re not going to say that precisely.</p>
<p t="5130200" d="5920">It’s an act of courage to be truthful with
someone.</p>
<p t="5136120" d="4670">Because they’re actually interacting with
the actual you.</p>
<p t="5140790" d="1120">So there’s no façade.</p>
<p t="5141910" d="1270">So that’s one thing.</p>
<p t="5143180" d="1970">So you get more courageous.</p>
<p t="5145150" d="4910">But then the next thing might be…</p>
<p t="5150060" d="5130">I would say that you have a more sympathetic
relationship with yourself.</p>
<p t="5155190" d="2820">Because let’s say you have this stupid memory
about something dumb that you did when you</p>
<p t="5158010" d="1000">were 13.</p>
<p t="5159010" d="1730">And you’re still carrying that along.</p>
<p t="5160740" d="3439">It’s like, Jesus, you were 13, what the
hell do you expect?</p>
<p t="5164179" d="3411">13-year-olds are just dumb as sticks, they’re
going to do all sorts of stupid things.</p>
<p t="5167590" d="4470">Their brains are all addled from hormones
and they’re trapped in those little educational</p>
<p t="5172060" d="1000">prisons.</p>
<p t="5173060" d="2530">So they’re going to do stupid things.</p>
<p t="5175590" d="3410">But if you’re carrying that it’s like
it’s you that did that.</p>
<p t="5179000" d="3130">It’s not some stupid 13-year-old that you
once were.</p>
<p t="5182130" d="5500">And so then you can start to see yourself
in perspective, you know, as a 13-year-old</p>
<p t="5187630" d="1410">like other 13-year-olds.</p>
<p t="5189040" d="2730">No better, but perhaps no worse.</p>
<p t="5191770" d="6210">So you can get on your side, in some sense,
by walking through your story and seeing what</p>
<p t="5197980" d="1400">the causal elements are.</p>
<p t="5199380" d="1570">Does that seem reasonable?</p>
<p t="5200950" d="3940">Okay, okay, yeah, well so that’s a good
thing.</p>
<p t="5204890" d="1030">[Student: I think…</p>
<p t="5205920" d="6700">I really liked it, again, because you really
get to know other people and I really liked</p>
<p t="5212620" d="1000">that.</p>
<p t="5213620" d="6230">I think that it was also interesting that
other people not necessarily knew more about</p>
<p t="5219850" d="4430">you than you did, but they contemplated the
information that you gave them…</p>
<p t="5224280" d="3360">like I know that someone looked at something
that I’d written in a completely different</p>
<p t="5227640" d="2580">light than I did, and I thought that was so
interesting.</p>
<p t="5230220" d="5130">Just like, the idea of kind of looking at
it a little bit more from the outside, and</p>
<p t="5235350" d="1790">getting a different perspective on it.]</p>
<p t="5237140" d="6320">Right, well that’s… what’s the famous
poem on the best gift we can possibly be given</p>
<p t="5243460" d="1820">is to see ourselves as others see us?</p>
<p t="5245280" d="4430">I think it’s Robbie Burns and I just mangled
the hell out of it.</p>
<p t="5249710" d="4120">But yeah, you do get that opportunity, and
it’s weird.</p>
<p t="5253830" d="2840">And this is something the positive illusion
people never think about either.</p>
<p t="5256670" d="5220">It’s that sometimes people think they’re
better than they are, like objectively, whatever</p>
<p t="5261890" d="1000">that means.</p>
<p t="5262890" d="3970">But lots of times the opposite is true, and
I think it’s often it’s true even more</p>
<p t="5266860" d="1000">often.</p>
<p t="5267860" d="1420">It’s like, people think they’re a lot
worse than they are.</p>
<p t="5269280" d="5700">No one’s as anxious as me or as concerned
about X or is as confused about this or as</p>
<p t="5274980" d="4440">socially awkward, or is not funny, or you
know, everybody’s got their paranoia about</p>
<p t="5279420" d="4920">this part of them that’s the worst that
anyone could possibly be in the entire world</p>
<p t="5284340" d="4240">and it’s almost never true.</p>
<p t="5288580" d="2290">Other people are a lot more like that than
you think.</p>
<p t="5290870" d="3850">And they’re running around trying to hide
it madly as well.</p>
<p t="5294720" d="2110">So that’s a good thing.</p>
<p t="5296830" d="3460">Well you know, you’re also allowing yourself…
in some sense you’re allowing yourself up</p>
<p t="5300290" d="1000">into the light.</p>
<p t="5301290" d="1970">You go through your life and you think, well
I can allow other people…</p>
