<p t="4270" d="6919">So I&#39;m going to read something that Nietzsche wrote in the first part Beyond good and evil. Which is a</p>
<p t="12460" d="2389">section called prejudices of Philosophers</p>
<p t="15670" d="2180">and it&#39;s a really good example of</p>
<p t="18820" d="2000">the density of this book</p>
<p t="22300" d="5120">one of the ways of conceptualizing Beyond good and evil, and I think this is true for most great works of</p>
<p t="28750" d="2149">It&#39;s true. Most great works is that</p>
<p t="34000" d="2000">the</p>
<p t="36000" d="2000">author of the work</p>
<p t="39220" d="2220">Collects; unconsciously collects</p>
<p t="41440" d="1400"> </p>
<p t="42840" d="1320">patterns</p>
<p t="44170" d="3680">from his or her interaction with the world and</p>
<p t="48610" d="2599">then gives them initial formulation</p>
<p t="52780" d="3439">and the patterns can be deep and</p>
<p t="58930" d="1740">multi-level and</p>
<p t="60670" d="1770">the initial formulation</p>
<p t="62440" d="6289">translates them into not so much ideas as into the seeds of future ideas and</p>
<p t="69250" d="2000">the more poetically</p>
<p t="71619" d="3800">Author happens to be the more the case that his or her</p>
<p t="76240" d="3620">ratings contained within the seeds of Future ideas and</p>
<p t="81070" d="7790">Were the romantic philosophers or authors, and I think Nietzsche and dostoevsky are in some sense foremost among them are particularly</p>
<p t="89950" d="2959">notable for their ability to do exactly that</p>
<p t="93850" d="2059">now in this particular paragraph</p>
<p t="96759" d="3230">This particular paragraph, not only serves as an example of that</p>
<p t="100810" d="2389">But it also serves as a self-conscious</p>
<p t="103960" d="3860">Reflection on that because Nietzsche is writing a paragraph here that is</p>
<p t="108700" d="2000">full of the seeds of</p>
<p t="110710" d="2000">ideas that will actually</p>
<p t="113220" d="2840">bloom and flower to a great degree in the 20th century</p>
<p t="117320" d="3100">But while  he&#39;s simultaneously revealing these those ideas</p>
<p t="120420" d="6100">He&#39;s also telling you exactly how he&#39;s doing it, and how it is that philosophers do it so it&#39;s a spectacular</p>
<p t="127480" d="1320">accomplishment</p>
<p t="128800" d="2000">I&#39;m going to read it</p>
<p t="131520" d="7000">Probably phrase by phrase and then take it apart because it&#39;s so dense and Beyond good evil is like that</p>
<p t="138520" d="3069">When Nietzsche was writing beyond good and evil. He wasn&#39;t very well and</p>
<p t="142920" d="5030">Because of that he had to spend a lot of time thinking and not very much time writing and because he was also</p>
<p t="148170" d="2000">Brilliant Beyond comprehension</p>
<p t="150600" d="2000">his ability to</p>
<p t="152780" d="2060">Distill what he was thinking into</p>
<p t="155840" d="2000">Incredibly rich</p>
<p t="157880" d="4460">Phrases and I think in some sense. It&#39;s Beyond parallel. 
I mean</p>
<p t="163200" d="4660">Often if I&#39;m reading a book if it has any utility at I&#39;ll mark it</p>
<p t="168260" d="4400">Usually I fold over the top of the page or sometimes put a yellow sticky note on it</p>
<p t="172660" d="4060">If I find a place where there&#39;s an idea that&#39;s worth returning to that</p>
<p t="177300" d="1920">that&#39;s</p>
<p t="179220" d="2000">That&#39;s particularly worth understanding</p>
<p t="181230" d="630">and</p>
<p t="181860" d="5690">you can&#39;t do that with a book like Beyond good and evil because what ends up happening is you have to mark every sentence and</p>
<p t="187890" d="4220">Obviously marking every sentence isn&#39;t any better than not marking any sentences at all</p>
<p t="192930" d="2000">so</p>
<p t="203500" d="5080">I guess I also might as well tell you why it is worth bothering with a book like this at all</p>
<p t="209580" d="5280">Because it&#39;s a very difficult book, and it&#39;s also the sort of book that will rattle you up.</p>
<p t="214860" d="7000">So Nietzsche is very interested in the problem of value and the problem of value fundamentally is</p>
<p t="222660" d="2000">not the problem of</p>
<p t="224910" d="4789">What is the world made of or even how does the world function which are more</p>
<p t="230549" d="3080">in some sense more specifically scientific questions</p>
<p t="233629" d="5151">but how is it that you should conduct yourself in the world how should you act and</p>
<p t="240320" d="6380">People act towards aims in a sense because we&#39;re active creatures, and we&#39;re moving from one point to another</p>
<p t="247500" d="6700">we&#39;re moving towards things that we want and that means that we&#39;re guided by our desires and</p>
<p t="254700" d="2840">We&#39;re not only guided by Desires insofar as we have</p>
<p t="258269" d="2330">individual desires, we&#39;re guided by</p>
<p t="261389" d="2120">the structure that</p>
<p t="264660" d="2899">Consists of how those desires are related to one another</p>
<p t="268380" d="2539">So for example if you have a room full of people</p>
<p t="272639" d="2000">Say a room full of children</p>
<p t="276450" d="3139">They&#39;re active and they&#39;re each pursuing their individual desires</p>
<p t="279590" d="3869">But at some point they may choose to organize themselves into a game</p>
<p t="283460" d="7320">And if they organize themselves into a game what they&#39;re doing for all intents and purposes is producing a little Society</p>
<p t="291080" d="4180">Little Micro Society within that micro Society they&#39;re deciding</p>
<p t="295590" d="7339">What desires will be currently expressed and how they&#39;ll exist in relationship to one another and that means that they can cooperate?</p>
<p t="303270" d="2330">without too much conflict and that</p>
<p t="306150" d="1560">They can</p>
<p t="307710" d="3679">jointly Move Towards a joint Aim</p>
<p t="312419" d="1470">without</p>
<p t="313889" d="2000">and</p>
<p t="316050" d="1170">and</p>
<p t="317220" d="5629">Gather all the benefits that might be associated with that and that might be the accomplishment of the aim, whatever it is</p>
<p t="322849" d="5210">But it also might be just the enjoyment that&#39;s to be had in the pursuit of that activity now</p>
<p t="328669" d="2000">People do that</p>
<p t="333590" d="5720">socially because we have to do that in order to get along with other people because our desires have to be melded with those of</p>
<p t="339310" d="4019">Other people but we also do it psychologically and those two things</p>
<p t="344030" d="4009">Exist in a dance because as I&#39;m interacting with other people</p>
<p t="350300" d="3350">the demands of the fact that we&#39;re interacting</p>
<p t="354259" d="6140">May require each of us to arrange our desires in a way that&#39;s acceptable to everyone else</p>
<p t="361310" d="6589">But at the same time while we&#39;re doing that we&#39;re also observing the process by which those desires are ordered</p>
<p t="367900" d="5339">And then we internalize that process and use that to order our own desires and then so there&#39;s a constant</p>
<p t="375380" d="7279">mutually informative dance between the individual and the group and the culmination of that is the organization of society and the simultaneous</p>
<p t="383270" d="2000">organization of the Psyche and</p>
<p t="385759" d="7279">It&#39;s that process that Nietzsche is talking about in these paragraphs. Now, you might ask yourself</p>
<p t="394130" d="2479">Well, what&#39;s the utility of</p>
<p t="397580" d="3350">articulating such things and conceptualizing them and understanding them? and</p>
<p t="401960" d="3440">The answer in some ways is straightforward</p>
<p t="406400" d="5420">If you don&#39;t want to run afoul of your own desires you have to organize them</p>
<p t="413240" d="2320">Because some of them are short-term and some of them are</p>
<p t="415900" d="4940">medium-term and some of them are long-term and some of them aim at this and some of them aim at that</p>
<p t="420849" d="2991">And it isn&#39;t necessarily the case that those desires</p>
<p t="424880" d="2929">allow for mutual fulfillment, so for example</p>
<p t="427880" d="3709">Maybe you&#39;re very interested in pursuing a sexual relationship with someone</p>
<p t="431930" d="4130">But you&#39;re also very interested in having a family and some stability in your life</p>
<p t="436060" d="5579">Or maybe you&#39;re interested in pursuing a sexual relationship with a whole sequence of people</p>
<p t="441639" d="6420">But you&#39;re also interested in having a family and stabilizing your life. It&#39;s not obvious that those desires can</p>
<p t="448789" d="6500">exist in the same universe without producing what you might think about as war and some of that might be a</p>
<p t="455630" d="4339">Psychological war some of its also going to be a war that actually</p>
<p t="460490" d="4429">occurs in existence while you&#39;re fighting through the contradictory</p>
<p t="465289" d="4460">Consequences of wanting to pursue many people and formulate a stable relationship with one person</p>
<p t="473479" d="5059">now part of the reason that you want to think about these sorts of things is because if you think about them and</p>
<p t="478729" d="2000">get your thoughts and</p>
<p t="481009" d="2000">your value system</p>
<p t="484370" d="1979">intelligently and</p>
<p t="486349" d="3311">Coherently and cogently laid out then</p>
<p t="490580" d="2520">when you act out that value system in the world</p>
<p t="493400" d="5080">You&#39;re going to run into less conflict and less uncertainty and less misery and you&#39;re going to have a higher</p>
<p t="498800" d="2800">Probability of getting what it is that you want.</p>
<p t="502220" d="1940">But you&#39;re also going to have a higher probability</p>
<p t="504160" d="5020">Of getting what you want in a way that allows you to cooperate with other people without</p>
<p t="510380" d="2320">entering into too much conflict with them and</p>
<p t="513620" d="7010">So in some sense the purpose that you think the reason that you think are the purpose of thinking is so that you can</p>
<p t="520969" d="1591">sort out</p>
<p t="522560" d="3919">How you&#39;re going to move forward in the world without having to</p>
<p t="527390" d="1259">directly</p>
<p t="528649" d="4429">Run headlong into all the obstacles that you might run into if you were doing such a thing</p>
<p t="533209" d="3380">Blindly and so then you might ask yourself. Well why would you bother reading?</p>
<p t="537949" d="5420">Philosophy or the Philosophy Written by someone who&#39;s great and the answer to that is that</p>
<p t="543949" d="6950">They can help you think these things through in a manner that you would not be capable of doing on your own</p>
<p t="551180" d="2000">you know because</p>
<p t="553310" d="6440">Nietzsche minutes it&#39;s difficult to estimate how intelligent Nietzsche was but I suspect he was perhaps</p>
<p t="560269" d="1771">one in a billion</p>
<p t="562040" d="2000">which would put him far Beyond the</p>
<p t="564240" d="3240">99.999% and</p>
<p t="568160" d="3619">there&#39;s a massive difference between the ability of people to</p>
<p t="572570" d="5479">think as you move farther and farther out into the extremes of intelligence and</p>
<p t="578779" d="2480">when you have the writings of someone who&#39;s</p>
<p t="582140" d="7189">one in a billion, then you can interact with those writings in the way that enables you if you&#39;ll put the time into</p>
<p t="591319" d="3410">benefit from the spectacular fact of that intelligence</p>
<p t="595760" d="5180">Nietzsche was a full professor by the time he was 24 at a time and now he didn&#39;t even have to write his dissertation</p>
<p t="601040" d="5640">They just made him a full professor at a time where that never happened</p>
<p t="613140" d="3280">so this is what he has to say in the prejudices of</p>
<p t="616580" d="3680">Philosophers such as the first chapter of the book Beyond good and evil</p>
<p t="622660" d="2540">“It has gradually become clear to me</p>
<p t="625700" d="7020">what every great philosophy up till now has consisted of namely the confession of its originator and</p>
<p t="633180" d="4160">the species of Involuntary and unconscious autobiography”</p>
<p t="639180" d="1200">well</p>
<p t="640380" d="2000">That&#39;s a deceptive</p>
<p t="642780" d="7780">That&#39;s a deceptively simple sentence even though. It&#39;s not a particularly simple sentence because it it stands on its head. What people generally</p>
<p t="651240" d="2060">assume about the process of thinking</p>
<p t="655740" d="5640">You generally think that when you&#39;re thinking you&#39;re thinking about, as I mentioned before, the structure of the objective world but</p>
<p t="662100" d="2900">Nietzsche is making an entirely different point here</p>
<p t="665000" d="7739">and what he&#39;s fundamentally doing is treating the philosopher not as a rational being but as a living being and</p>
<p t="673500" d="4070">There&#39;s a big difference between being a rational being and being a living being</p>
<p t="677820" d="3289">Because if you&#39;re a living being your primary goal is to do whatever it</p>
<p t="681110" d="4410">Is that furthers your life. And if you&#39;re a rational being then your primary goal is to do whatever it</p>
<p t="685520" d="6630">is that a rational being might do and you could say that a living being should first and foremost be a</p>
<p t="692430" d="6710">Rational being and in some sense that&#39;s the message of the of the western enlightenment, but it&#39;s by no means</p>
<p t="699990" d="1250">Self-evident that that&#39;s the case</p>
<p t="701240" d="4470">And it&#39;s certainly not something that Nietzsche doesn&#39;t believe that people are rational beings</p>
<p t="706140" d="7609">As certainly not primarily and more importantly he isn&#39;t exactly convinced that they should be. So, for example, one of Nietzsche&#39;s most</p>
<p t="713820" d="2000">Famous Maxim&#39;s is that</p>
<p t="716370" d="2000">truth serves life and</p>
<p t="718860" d="6680">That&#39;s a very difficult different idea then the purpose of truth says the accurate representation of the objective world</p>
<p t="726060" d="3049">Those aren&#39;t the same thing at all now you could ask well</p>
<p t="729110" d="4080">What does it mean for truth to serve life and if you construe truth that way?</p>
<p t="733190" d="7559">What would truth look like and you know the mere statement: &quot;the truth should serve life&quot; doesn&#39;t offer you the answers to those questions</p>
<p t="741480" d="2000">but</p>
<p t="744470" d="5450">But it&#39;s the beginning of a different metaphysics and in some sense of metaphysics</p>
<p t="749920" d="4320">which is say the universe within which a philosopher might operate a</p>
<p t="754879" d="1981">metaphysics is the</p>
<p t="756860" d="2000">initial structure of presuppositions</p>
<p t="759949" d="3859">Within which a view of the world is organized</p>
<p t="765980" d="4789">One presupposition might be human beings are rational and that we&#39;re attempting to</p>
<p t="772160" d="1919">formulate and improve our</p>
<p t="774079" d="7820">Sense of the objective world our formulation of the objective world and another would be that human beings aren&#39;t rational were irrational and that were</p>
<p t="782360" d="6169">Motivated to do is to live whatever that means and that the purpose of our thinking and our philosophy should be to facilitate</p>
<p t="788870" d="3799">our living and that&#39;s Nietzsche&#39;s that&#39;s one of the</p>
<p t="793699" d="2000">foundation</p>
<p t="795980" d="2000">blocks of Nietzsche&#39;s philosophy</p>
<p t="799189" d="7280">So he&#39;s a moral philosopher fundamentally because morality is about values and values essentially values are</p>
<p t="807920" d="4159">You could say values are what you aim for but it&#39;s more complicated than that values</p>
<p t="812449" d="5150">Actually constitute the lens through which you view the world so it&#39;s partly what you&#39;re aiming at</p>
<p t="817600" d="5130">but it&#39;s also partly your conception of who you are now and where you are and it&#39;s also partly your</p>
<p t="822829" d="2000">conception of how you&#39;re going to get to</p>
<p t="825589" d="2150">Where it is that you want to be and it&#39;s also?</p>
<p t="828379" d="2000">partly the</p>
<p t="831649" d="3350">Psychological system that you use to parse up the world so that it</p>
<p t="835069" d="3500">Reveals to you the pathway that you can take to get to what you want</p>
<p t="839089" d="4520">Values all of that, and then it&#39;s more than that because you could say that you have our value</p>
<p t="844850" d="1339">Which contains all of that?</p>
<p t="846189" d="3930">But then you can say that you have a set of values which is the arrangement of all of that</p>
<p t="850120" d="2000">And then you could say that you have a set of values</p>
<p t="852139" d="4369">that&#39;s the arrangement of all that that you have to arrange with other people and</p>
<p t="856639" d="1440">Then you could say that</p>
<p t="858079" d="5510">You have all that and you have to arrange it with other people and you have to arrange it across different spans of time</p>
<p t="863870" d="2479">Because what you want today, and what you want next week</p>
<p t="866350" d="5399">And what you want next month are not necessarily the same thing and one does not necessarily lead into the other</p>
<p t="872209" d="3830">so to be a moral philosopher is to examine how that</p>
<p t="876980" d="5029">What that system is and how it operates and how it came about now one of the things that Nietzsche says is</p>
<p t="882259" d="1940">It has gradually become clear to me</p>
<p t="884199" d="7590">Whatever Greek philosophy up till now is consisted of namely the confession of its originator and a species of involuntary and unconscious</p>
<p t="892129" d="4669">Autobiography so his claim fundamentally is that no matter what the philosopher thinks,</p>
<p t="896809" d="4280">He&#39;s doing while he&#39;s reading philosophy what he&#39;s actually doing is</p>
<p t="902179" d="1801">revealing and</p>
<p t="903980" d="2000">articulating his being and</p>
<p t="906829" d="1220">Then you might say well</p>
<p t="908049" d="4560">where did that being come from and the answer to that is well partly it&#39;s</p>
<p t="913009" d="3710">You could consider it a biological function insofar as that we have</p>
<p t="917089" d="5959">Value structures that are built into us that are the process we would say the process of a very long evolutionary history</p>
<p t="923209" d="3589">but because you&#39;re also a cultural phenomena and</p>
<p t="927259" d="7429">because the manner in which you&#39;ve arranged your values and your desires has been conditioned to the last degree by the</p>
<p t="935260" d="3860">process of enculturation that you are subjected to when you</p>
<p t="941860" d="7200">Confess in an autobiographical manner and articulate that what you&#39;re also doing is recapitulating</p>
<p t="949220" d="4130">The entire structure of your culture it&#39;s in you and you might say well</p>
<p t="953350" d="3900">Where is it in you? And what is in you mean? part of it means is that</p>
<p t="957649" d="2390">you act out a pattern of behavior and</p>
<p t="960559" d="3710">That pattern of behavior is like a a dance that someone is</p>
<p t="964790" d="4159">Manifesting to a symphonic score. It&#39;s unbelievably complicated and</p>
<p t="969589" d="1290">It has its</p>
<p t="970879" d="5480">Psychological elements and some of those are conscious and some of them aren&#39;t some of them are just implicit and embedded in the way you</p>
<p t="976360" d="5939">Act and the way you perceive, and what the philosopher is attempting to do is to reveal those to himself and to</p>
<p t="983269" d="6049">Articulate them so that the entire structure can be analysed well, so Nietzsche&#39;s first proposition. Is that when</p>
<p t="990589" d="3469">Philosopher is thinking that what he&#39;s doing is not thinking</p>
<p t="994059" d="7650">it&#39;s revealing himself in an autobiographical sense under the guise of rational thinking and so then it becomes something more like a story and</p>
<p t="1004389" d="2000">Well, and he covers all that in the first</p>
<p t="1007290" d="1620">two phrases</p>
<p t="1008910" d="4369">so that gives you some example some indication of what this book is like.</p>
<p t="1015570" d="3230">A species of involuntary and unconscious autobiography</p>
<p t="1022110" d="3139">Well, that&#39;s a more complicated idea too because you might say well</p>
<p t="1025250" d="5280">Why would someone be driven in a nun book in Voluntary way in an unconscious way to</p>
<p t="1031770" d="2000">describe their autobiography? and</p>
<p t="1035130" d="6500">that&#39;s a very complicated question it might be that one of the reasons that people value one another is because we</p>
<p t="1043890" d="4550">engage in the process of sharing Deeply autobiographical information</p>
<p t="1049020" d="3739">You tell me your story, and I tell you my story, and you might say well</p>
<p t="1052760" d="3150">why do we even bother with such things and the answer to that is well if</p>
<p t="1056130" d="5359">You can tell me about the pain and tragedy that you&#39;ve encountered then that gives me a better</p>
<p t="1062400" d="3650">Way.. that gives me a better vision of the dangers of the world</p>
<p t="1066660" d="5089">Without actually having to expose myself to those dangers except in simulation. I might feel sorry for you</p>
<p t="1071750" d="4200">I might feel bad about your tragic experiences, but I&#39;m not bleeding for them</p>
<p t="1075950" d="3010">And then there&#39;s always the possibility that you&#39;ll also tell me</p>
<p t="1078980" d="1570">How you solved your problem.</p>
<p t="1080550" d="3790">In which case I can either avoid that problem entirely or if I do encounter</p>
<p t="1084350" d="1980">I can solve it without having to go through.</p>
<p t="1086330" d="5309">Maybe it took you decades to formulate your solution to that problem, and you can tell me your story</p>
<p t="1091640" d="4410">And then I have the information, and so that&#39;s part of what human beings are always trading</p>
<p t="1096050" d="5369">That&#39;s why we talk to each other. That&#39;s why we can communicate and so Nietzsche would say well, it&#39;s it&#39;s involuntary</p>
<p t="1102030" d="1260">unconscious</p>
<p t="1103290" d="7760">Involuntary and unconscious. He&#39;s alluding to the fact that that proclivity is so deeply embedded in people that the desire to</p>
<p t="1111750" d="2599">to make an autobiographical recounting that</p>
<p t="1117300" d="6290">It serves as the kind of motivation that we don&#39;t question for doing almost everything that we do</p>
<p t="1124380" d="1830">So you know I mean</p>
<p t="1126210" d="4699">People do such things as attend movies and plays and they usually do that happily</p>
<p t="1131220" d="5390">Especially if the movie or the play is of high quality and the same thing happens with we&#39;re reading novels</p>
<p t="1138840" d="1110">they&#39;re</p>
<p t="1139950" d="5179">Attracted to such things they have a built-in value, and it&#39;s very rarely the case that people will ever question</p>
<p t="1145130" d="6330">why it is that they&#39;re doing such things in fact you see this quite commonly with students who are first introduced to the study of</p>
<p t="1151460" d="970">literature</p>
<p t="1152430" d="3199">the the introduction of the idea that you should</p>
<p t="1157530" d="4520">Analyze what it is that you&#39;re engaged in when you&#39;re reading actually</p>
<p t="1163140" d="2869">comes as unwelcome news to most people who are</p>
<p t="1166320" d="7069">Inclined towards fiction because they don&#39;t want to interfere with the process of engagement you know automatic unconscious engagement with the material</p>
<p t="1173780" d="3740">By detaching themselves and having to think about what they&#39;re doing</p>
<p t="1178280" d="3220">So that&#39;s why it&#39;s an involuntary and unconscious</p>
<p t="1182040" d="6680">It&#39;s it&#39;s one of the things within which thought operates rather than one of the things on which thought operates.</p>
<p t="1192080" d="4640">Then he says “The moral or immoral purpose in which every philosophy has constituted...”</p>
<p t="1197460" d="5920">Sorry; “The moral or immoral purpose IN every Philosophy has constituted the true</p>
<p t="1203700" d="4040">Vital germ out of which the entire plant has always grown”</p>
<p t="1208440" d="5720">Well, that&#39;s a hell of a thing to say too because what Nietzsche is alluding to there in some sense is that</p>
<p t="1221229" d="5990">The Philosopher can&#39;t help and that would be in some sense also the person who is recounting their autobiography</p>
<p t="1227640" d="2320">Can&#39;t help but tell you what they&#39;re up to</p>
<p t="1231100" d="5760">even though they might not know and this is something that Jung because Jung was, Carl Jung, the</p>
<p t="1237280" d="2760">psychoanalyst was a great student of Nietzsche and</p>
<p t="1241060" d="2000">Jung came to</p>
<p t="1243070" d="4760">Believe that we all inhabited stories that the stories were the stories</p>
<p t="1247830" d="4859">We inhabited were actually the structures of value within which we live and that those stories</p>
<p t="1253450" d="2059">essentially had an ethic or a moral and</p>
<p t="1255999" d="3470">Then you you can start thinking about what the ethics and the morals</p>
<p t="1259539" d="4939">Might be and you kind of have some sense of that because there&#39;s there&#39;s comedic stories and tragic stories</p>
<p t="1264479" d="4050">And there&#39;s evil characters and good characters and so forth those are our particular characters</p>
<p t="1268720" d="5929">But part of the point that Nietzsche is attempting to make here is that the philosopher is in fact aiming at something with his life</p>
<p t="1275619" d="6859">With all of his actions he might not even know what it is, but partly what he&#39;s doing in his attempt to philosophize is to</p>
<p t="1283059" d="3260">articulate that and reveal it to himself and to other people, so</p>
<p t="1290440" d="4849">then the question becomes well, what is it that the person is up to and I would say in some sense</p>
<p t="1295289" d="5760">that&#39;s the ultimate question and so Nietzsche here in this paragraph it is also dealing with the with the</p>
<p t="1301749" d="6854">Ultimate question in life which might be well what is your life aimed, and you might say well, it&#39;s not aimed at anything</p>
<p t="1308603" d="3456">I don&#39;t know I don&#39;t seem to have any coherent set of beliefs</p>
<p t="1312059" d="4289">I don&#39;t know what I believe I don&#39;t believe in anything even but that&#39;s not the case because</p>
<p t="1316599" d="2540">if you didn&#39;t believe in anything, you couldn&#39;t see</p>
<p t="1320289" d="4969">you have to believe in something to be able to see because you point your eyes at things and you can&#39;t organize your</p>
<p t="1325359" d="7100">Vision without having an aim and so the very act of interacting with the world presupposes an ethic and then all those</p>
<p t="1333099" d="5870">Micro ethics that you contain within you are organized into some sort of structure either</p>
<p t="1339220" d="2149">Badly or well, and that structure</p>
<p t="1341889" d="1071">Roughly has an aim</p>
<p t="1342960" d="5130">And you might know it and you might not but that doesn&#39;t mean it isn&#39;t there so so what other thing that Nietzsche is</p>
<p t="1348090" d="2000">Alluding to is that you believe things</p>
<p t="1350680" d="2080">Whether or not you think you believe them.</p>
<p t="1353540" d="6560">In fact believing them and knowing you believe them aren&#39;t even the same thing and so that people believe all sorts of things that</p>
<p t="1360340" d="3300">They don&#39;t know about and then partly what they&#39;re doing when they&#39;re doing</p>
<p t="1363700" d="4900">Philosophy is to try to figure out what those things are you know and you can also ask yourself where did they come from?</p>
<p t="1369360" d="2000">Well they partly came from you, but you</p>
<p t="1372060" d="2000">You&#39;re an old thing</p>
<p t="1374170" d="5209">Your physical form is three and a half billion years old, and you&#39;re the process of all that</p>
<p t="1379990" d="2570">all the death and struggling that went</p>
<p t="1383290" d="7069">Along the entire course of that three and a half billion years is you carry that with you and then on top of that</p>
<p t="1391120" d="2780">Inside you is the consequence of the entire</p>
<p t="1394480" d="3739">Cultural history of Complex life, that&#39;s all inside you, too</p>
<p t="1398220" d="4320">and then on top of that some of that&#39;s articulated more or less some fits act without</p>
<p t="1403270" d="4189">Dramatized represented in fiction and that sort of thing and then some of its articulated</p>
<p t="1407770" d="7130">but there&#39;s way more at the bottom than is fully articulated and so God only knows what you&#39;re up to and</p>
<p t="1415180" d="3289">Then you might say well who cares? well the problem with that</p>
<p t="1418470" d="3930">Is that you care because first of all that&#39;s the definition of caring and second of all</p>
<p t="1423250" d="2000">that Determines the</p>
<p t="1425530" d="2270">way that you&#39;ll move through your life and</p>
<p t="1428950" d="1100">Everything that happens to you</p>
<p t="1430050" d="5669">That&#39;s good or evil or good or bad is going to be a consequence of the manifestation of that ethic in the world</p>
<p t="1439450" d="2870">So now Nietzsche is saying something else too when he says:</p>
<p t="1443230" d="6590">“The moral or immoral purpose in every Philosophy has</p>
<p t="1450220" d="3739">Constituted the true vital germ out of which the entire plant is always grown”</p>
<p t="1455470" d="6680">He&#39;s saying that the philosopher can&#39;t help but reveal his aim in his writings, and then he&#39;s saying something else</p>
<p t="1462150" d="2309">which is that aim might be malevolent and</p>
<p t="1465850" d="3739">You know modern people aren&#39;t very comfortable with ideas like</p>
<p t="1470380" d="3650">malevolence because malevolence is an idea that&#39;s related to evil and</p>
<p t="1475720" d="3560">Modern people think of themselves as beyond good and evil to some degree</p>
<p t="1479350" d="6090">they don&#39;t believe in the reality of those concepts and of course in this book Nietzsche&#39;s also questioning our</p>
<p t="1486170" d="7339">At least our a priori presuppositions about what good and evil are but that doesn&#39;t mean that he doesn&#39;t believe that they don&#39;t exist</p>
<p t="1494150" d="5570">That doesn&#39;t mean that. He doesn&#39;t believe that they don&#39;t exist yes. I guess that&#39;s I guess that&#39;s right</p>
<p t="1503180" d="4880">You know this is one of the things I&#39;ve thought about when I was thinking about when I thought about how Hitler died</p>
<p t="1508580" d="2000">No, Hitler died...</p>
<p t="1511640" d="6950">Hitler Committed suicide in a bunker underneath Berlin when Europe was in flames and so one</p>
<p t="1520580" d="7039">Conclusion that a psycho analytically minded historian could derive from that is that&#39;s what he wanted</p>
<p t="1529190" d="2900">Right and then that opens up an entire</p>
<p t="1533690" d="4130">Vast nest of snakes because one of the things that you might ask is well</p>
<p t="1538160" d="5839">how is it that someone would desire that? First of all could that even be desired? Is that actually something that anyone could even desire?</p>
<p t="1545420" d="4160">Then you might ask well. Why is it that someone would desire that and</p>
<p t="1550190" d="6619">Then the next thing you might ask is if a human being could desire that and hit there was a human being then exactly what?</p>
<p t="1556810" d="2699">Does that say about you and you might say well?</p>
<p t="1559510" d="5219">I could never desire such a thing but following along the train of the argument that we&#39;ve been laying out is like</p>
<p t="1564730" d="3150">What makes you think you&#39;re a reliable judge of what it is that you&#39;re up to?</p>
<p t="1569240" d="3920">So okay, so now we&#39;ve unpacked three sentences and</p>
<p t="1575120" d="2150">We&#39;ll continue on with the same paragraph</p>
<p t="1579200" d="1800">“Indeed to understand</p>
<p t="1581000" d="6180">How the most abstract metaphysical assertions of a philosopher have been arrived at</p>
<p t="1587480" d="7220">It is always well and wise to first ask oneself: What morality do they or does he aim at?”</p>
<p t="1595480" d="3500">So what the question is what&#39;s the personality?</p>
<p t="1600290" d="2000">well</p>
<p t="1602610" d="5659">There&#39;s an entire nest of snakes underneath that sentence that&#39;s sequence of propositions as well</p>
<p t="1621860" d="5760">And one of them is well. What does it mean [that] people are up to something? What does it mean that they&#39;re aiming at something?</p>
<p t="1633020" d="4360">“Accordingly I do not believe that an impulse to knowledge is the father of philosophy</p>
<p t="1637640" d="4960">but that another impulse, here as elsewhere, has only made use of knowledge and</p>
<p t="1643400" d="2120">Mistaken knowledge as an instrument</p>
<p t="1646820" d="6780">But whoever considers the fundamental impulses of man with a view to determining how far they may have here acted is inspiring them”</p>
<p t="1654500" d="4100">This is partly where this is going to require editing; it&#39;s so complicated to go through.</p>
<p t="1664480" d="3820">“Accordingly I do not believe that an impulse to knowledge is the father of philosophy</p>
<p t="1669160" d="7260">But that another impulse, here as elsewhere, has only made use of knowledge and mistaken knowledge as an instrument”</p>
<p t="1676420" d="6060">Alright so let&#39;s take that apart; “accordingly I do not believe that an impulse to knowledge is the father of philosophy”</p>
<p t="1683500" d="4160">So one of the claims I suppose this would be an enlightenment claim is</p>
<p t="1688309" d="1021">that</p>
<p t="1689330" d="7489">People do have a drive to knowledge, and the that drive is in fact. What underlies the production of such things as philosophy</p>
<p t="1697520" d="6859">but Nietzsche questions that because he&#39;s trying to bring us back to consideration of the fact that you can&#39;t separate the</p>
<p t="1704809" d="3500">Philosopher&#39;s mind from the Philosopher&#39;s being</p>
<p t="1708830" d="6890">His first and foremost a living creature, and he&#39;s up to something and the question is what is it that</p>
<p t="1715720" d="4979">he&#39;s up to? And so you can see the earliest manifestations in</p>
<p t="1721040" d="2750">a paragraph like this of what later developed into</p>
<p t="1724340" d="1770">deconstructionist thought and</p>
<p t="1726110" d="7219">that that was mostly French continental philosophers who pursued that particular line of reasoning and</p>
<p t="1734990" d="5060">It is derived exactly from this kind of statement by Nietzsche</p>
<p t="1740809" d="2540">so for example someone like Derrida would say</p>
<p t="1745040" d="2569">It doesn&#39;t matter what the content of the text is</p>
<p t="1748220" d="3469">what matters is that the text can be used as a tool for power and</p>
<p t="1752120" d="2390">Then whether the person who wrote the text knew it or not?</p>
<p t="1754510" d="4970">that&#39;s what they were doing and they were doing it in a way to privilege themselves above other people and</p>
<p t="1760180" d="4820">That&#39;s really I would say the fundamental deconstructionist claim, and it&#39;s a powerful claim</p>
<p t="1765000" d="6800">It&#39;s an utterly corrupt claim, but it&#39;s a really powerful claim, and it&#39;s related directly to the sorts of things that Nietzsche was</p>
<p t="1772540" d="6649">Referring to in this paragraph. What is it that the person&#39;s truly up to? Now the problem with the de-constructionist claim</p>
<p t="1779190" d="7109">Is that it&#39;s an it&#39;s an open invitation to cynicism, to thoughtless cynicism. I can just make the presupposition that whatever it</p>
<p t="1786300" d="1930">Is that you&#39;re telling me</p>
<p t="1788230" d="3020">You&#39;re telling me merely to dominate</p>
<p t="1791830" d="2359">Regardless of what it is that you claim to be doing.</p>
<p t="1794860" d="3560">well the problem with that approach is that</p>
<p t="1800320" d="3890">It&#39;s predicated on the implicit assumption that the only</p>
<p t="1804670" d="5719">Value that people actually have is the value to is the desire to dominate and of course that&#39;s a purely</p>
<p t="1810670" d="2779">But that could be the case and I also think that</p>
<p t="1813640" d="4369">It&#39;s even reasonable to posit that to some degree that it is the case</p>
<p t="1818110" d="4640">But to take that from a contributing factor and to make that the highest God</p>
<p t="1823180" d="4610">because that&#39;s essentially what the de-constructionists are doing those are entirely different things and</p>
<p t="1828550" d="2000">You have to beware of people who</p>
<p t="1832300" d="4310">take a single causal element and elevate it to the stature of</p>
<p t="1838120" d="2839">single comprehensive cause. You know</p>
<p t="1841510" d="6079">it&#39;s more reasonable to assume that people are complex in their motivations and that many different strands of</p>
<p t="1848230" d="3709">Biological and cultural motivation are in some sense primary</p>
<p t="1851940" d="3090">and then what happens is that they come together to weave a kind of</p>
<p t="1855250" d="5270">Tapestry rather than to make the automatic assumption that you can reduce the entire set of human</p>
<p t="1860740" d="2989">Motivations to a single principle like that of power now</p>
<p t="1863730" d="7290">You know I would say Nietzsche is also responsible to some degree for the deconstructionist claim that its power because one of his most famous</p>
<p t="1871720" d="5479">Utterances was that the fundamental motivating force in life is the will to power</p>
<p t="1878290" d="5929">But he wasn&#39;t so much, because Nietzsche is a subtle thinker, he wasn&#39;t so much attempting to reduce</p>
<p t="1885130" d="6679">Human motivation to power he was attempting to redefine what it was that we conceptualized as power</p>
<p t="1892630" d="6229">Whereas that as the de-constructionists certainly you know all because fundamentally they&#39;re marxists and they believe that you know they</p>
<p t="1899440" d="3170">ensconced themselves within an economic Viewpoint where</p>
<p t="1903670" d="6260">Within a philosophical Viewpoint where economics is paramount and where all that matters is power</p>
<p t="1910810" d="2060">construed as socio economic</p>
<p t="1913870" d="2000">domination fundamental</p>
<p t="1916060" d="4550">You know and that&#39;s in turn is embedded in metaphysics. That&#39;s even deeper</p>
<p t="1920610" d="3689">which is the metaphysics that presumes that people are fundamentally materialist and</p>
<p t="1924850" d="3290">All of those things are quite and all of those things are highly questionable</p>
<p t="1942620" d="4909">So I&#39;m going to skip ahead a little bit of the paragraph when Nietzsche talks about</p>
<p t="1948890" d="3739">The motivations of you might consider them</p>
<p t="1954500" d="2149">people who are working in the Middle ranks of</p>
<p t="1957280" d="5900">Bureaucracies, whether they&#39;re scientific, or otherwise, so they&#39;re in some sense acting as cogs in a particular machine</p>
<p t="1963180" d="2480">And so that&#39;s what he&#39;s describing here he says</p>
<p t="1969520" d="5240">“In the case of scholars, in the case of really scientific men,</p>
<p t="1975620" d="1860">it may be [...]</p>
<p t="1977480" d="6280">there may really be such a thing as an ‘impulse to knowledge,' some kind of small, independent clock-work, which,</p>
<p t="1984500" d="3500">when well wound up, works away industriously to that end,</p>
<p t="1988550" d="2000">without the rest of the scholarly</p>
<p t="1990800" d="2420">impulses taking any material part therein.</p>
<p t="1993800" d="4760">The actual &#39;interests&#39; of the scholar, therefore, are generally in quite another direction -</p>
<p t="1999020" d="3660">it is the family, or in money-making, or in politics;</p>
<p t="2002860" d="7140">it is, in fact, almost indifferent at what point of research his little machine is placed, and whether the hopeful young worker becomes a good</p>
<p t="2010240" d="10160">Philologist [someone who studied the origin of words], a mushroom specialist, or a chemist; he is not characterised by becoming this or that.”</p>
<p t="2025260" d="4820">Nietzsche&#39;s point there, fundamentally, is that even when you do analyse people in whom</p>
<p t="2032070" d="3830">The will to knowledge might actually be offered</p>
<p t="2036360" d="4699">Even though he wouldn&#39;t be willing to granted the status of highest motivating power</p>
<p t="2041429" d="5690">That even in those people where that will to knowledge does exist the probability that that is in turn</p>
<p t="2047639" d="1710">Subordinated to some other</p>
<p t="2049349" d="3680">principle that&#39;s higher in the value Hierarchy is very very high and</p>
<p t="2053369" d="5360">It&#39;s hard to tell exactly what that additional principle might be but he points out such things as well</p>
<p t="2058730" d="3389">maybe they&#39;re primarily interested in serving the interests of their family or</p>
<p t="2062369" d="4580">They&#39;re primarily interested in making money or maybe they&#39;re primarily interested in status</p>
<p t="2066950" d="5459">And maybe they&#39;re interested in status status becomes it because it makes them more sexually attractive and that sort of thing, so</p>
<p t="2072990" d="2000">but the</p>
<p t="2076830" d="6919">question of what is it that&#39;s lurking in the background is always paramount, so</p>
<p t="2086010" d="2000">another</p>
<p t="2091020" d="2059">Detour in this particular paragraph</p>
<p t="2098600" d="2980">“whoever considers the fundamental impulses of man</p>
<p t="2102420" d="8480">with a view to determining how far they may have here acted as inspiring genii (or as demons),</p>
<p t="2110940" d="3460">will find that they have all practiced philosophy at one time or another,</p>
<p t="2114520" d="7180">and that each of them would have been only too glad to look upon itself as the ultimate end of existence and the</p>
<p t="2121860" d="2660">legitimate lord over all of the other impulses”</p>
<p t="2125300" d="6500">That&#39;s another like the beyond good and evil to think of it as a book is a really foolish</p>
<p t="2137490" d="2540">Framework you know because this is what a book is</p>
<p t="2141210" d="3620">when people think about a book no, it&#39;s like a material entity it&#39;s</p>
<p t="2145740" d="1830">It&#39;s eight inches high</p>
<p t="2147570" d="6139">And six inches wide and two inches thick and weighs a pound and it&#39;s made out of paper. It&#39;s between two</p>
<p t="2154260" d="4880">Covers you know and that&#39;s a materialist. That&#39;s the A priori sort of axiomatic</p>
<p t="2159900" d="2000">view of the book. But Nietzsche&#39;s</p>
<p t="2163020" d="3410">Beyond good, and Evil. Isn&#39;t a book at all. It&#39;s a series of bombs and</p>
<p t="2167310" d="2000">each sentence is a ball and</p>
<p t="2169770" d="6680">Each sentence blows things up that people don&#39;t even know exists and so one of the things with this sentence for example</p>
<p t="2177360" d="4909">here&#39;s how he&#39;s conceptualize a human being so the first thing he talks about is that</p>
<p t="2183420" d="3049">There are fundamental impulses of human beings</p>
<p t="2187110" d="6560">Okay, so that begs questions. What do you mean by impulse? And what do you mean by fundamental? and</p>
<p t="2194910" d="6109">Both of those are externally complicated problems, so an impulse you can think of an impulse as a drive</p>
<p t="2201630" d="2479">You could think about it as a biological instinct</p>
<p t="2205200" d="6319">You could think about it as an aim or a goal you could think about it as an act of will like there&#39;s endless</p>
<p t="2212880" d="4909">questions that hang off that question, but we could start with the idea that we</p>
<p t="2218760" d="1280">Perhaps can&#39;t Define it.</p>
<p t="2220040" d="7530">But we are willing to go with the proposition that people do have impulses and I think maybe that&#39;s manifest to you more particularly</p>
<p t="2228810" d="2629">when you&#39;re attempting to do something voluntarily and</p>
<p t="2233100" d="4550">something involuntarily interferes with that you know, so maybe you&#39;re sitting down to</p>
<p t="2238200" d="4010">To try to get some work done in the work is not of any particular</p>
<p t="2242730" d="2719">Intrinsic interest but you regard it as necessary</p>
<p t="2245720" d="7260">You know necessary element in some higher order scheme, and so you&#39;re attempting to organize yourself. So you will in fact concentrate on that</p>
<p t="2253560" d="2440">particular relatively mundane activity</p>
<p t="2256160" d="4020">But what you find when you sit down to actually engage in that is you can&#39;t do it.</p>
<p t="2260640" d="5179">You have to go do the dishes or you have to clean under the bed or you have to have a sexual fantasy?</p>
<p t="2265980" d="5660">or you or there&#39;s some other thing that you could do this useful but that you would normally do that</p>
<p t="2271640" d="5969">You&#39;ll go do instead or that you fall asleep or that you get hungry or like there&#39;s an endless number</p>
<p t="2277770" d="8000">Let&#39;s call them impulses that might arise to interfere with your conscious movement forward well exactly what are those things</p>
<p t="2286890" d="2000">while Nietzsche certainly</p>
<p t="2289320" d="4939">conceptualizes the human being as a place where those things live and</p>
<p t="2295080" d="4219">he does mean live to because it wouldn&#39;t refer to them as demons or</p>
<p t="2300120" d="1530">genies</p>
<p t="2301650" d="7010">Without introducing the metaphorical conception of something that lives and so hardly what Nietzsche reveals in those sentences is that he</p>
<p t="2308850" d="2179">conceptualized as a human being as the</p>
<p t="2312240" d="2000">dwelling place of Spirits and</p>
<p t="2315690" d="4160">Some of them are genii let&#39;s say, that&#39;s the root word of genius</p>
<p t="2319850" d="3869">That&#39;s the terribly powerful thing that exists in the terribly small</p>
<p t="2324240" d="3679">compartment right that you have to call forth and some of them are demons and</p>
<p t="2328460" d="4760">Demons are things that have their own autonomous will and the generally aren&#39;t aiming for the good</p>
<p t="2334380" d="6520">So then so those are all things Nietzsche just lays out as implicit parts of the sentence so he activates all those ideas</p>
<p t="2341360" d="5920">whether you know it or not in your mind to the degree that you process the sentence and those things start to take on a</p>
<p t="2347300" d="2000">life of Their own those ideas</p>
<p t="2350070" d="2000">and so</p>
<p t="2353100" d="4010">Then he adds another dimension of complexity to that by saying well</p>
<p t="2357990" d="2000">you&#39;re full of demons and</p>
<p t="2360100" d="2000">and genies and</p>
<p t="2364060" d="3109">They&#39;re all doing their own thing whatever that happens to be</p>
<p t="2367930" d="7370">but each of them if left to their own devices would attempt to remake the entire world in their</p>
<p t="2376960" d="1860">form and</p>
<p t="2378820" d="1740">So I</p>
<p t="2380560" d="1830">Thought of this</p>
<p t="2382390" d="4699">from a narrative point of view or from a symbolic point of view in</p>
<p t="2388060" d="3100">old stories in folk tales and Fairy Tales you often have</p>
<p t="2393700" d="5720">cyclops, they&#39;re one-eyed giants, and there&#39;s a sexual connotation to that</p>
<p t="2400680" d="5240">which is our proposed that the psychoanalysts would would certainly point out</p>
<p t="2405930" d="4710">But the one eye idea is that this thing is gigantic who wants one thing</p>
<p t="2412150" d="5479">And so that&#39;s another way that Nietzsche is conceptualizing the fundamental</p>
<p t="2420840" d="5040">Structure of the human psyche it&#39;s a dwelling place full of one-eyed giants</p>
<p t="2425880" d="3860">And they&#39;re constantly. well one thing one way of looking at is,</p>
<p t="2429749" d="1411">They&#39;re constantly at war</p>
<p t="2431170" d="1830">One of them wants to be the largest</p>
<p t="2433000" d="2030">one-eyed giant and dominate everything else</p>
<p t="2435030" d="7110">And then one of the things that so Nietzsche takes that argument further he says not only is this always happening in human beings</p>
<p t="2442300" d="3880">But that if you look at Philosophy what it is, is it&#39;s a continual</p>
<p t="2446800" d="2480">revelation of the attempt of some</p>
<p t="2449800" d="2270">singular Minded psychic</p>
<p t="2452650" d="3380">monsters psychological monster to dominate the entire</p>
<p t="2457480" d="5870">Psychological structure therefore the entire cultural structure therefore the entire world and then you can you can see in that</p>
<p t="2464200" d="5690">The entire religious structure struggle of mankind to take this vast</p>
<p t="2470590" d="1920">polytheistic</p>
<p t="2472510" d="1740">vision of</p>
<p t="2474250" d="2659">reality and to organize it into some sort of</p>
<p t="2477580" d="1380">monotheistic and</p>
<p t="2478960" d="2930">Integrated structure which you could also consider</p>
<p t="2483160" d="2000">indistinguishable from the</p>
<p t="2485220" d="5360">civilizing; the impulse that operates in human beings to become civilized</p>
<p t="2491100" d="1120">because</p>
<p t="2492220" d="6199">On the one hand it might a terrible thing that one one-eyed monster emerges to attempt to dominate all the others</p>
<p t="2498580" d="6799">but then on the other hand there&#39;s no difference between that and organizing something because to organize something is to bring it all into a</p>
<p t="2505869" d="7340">Hierarchical structure with some sort of singular value at the Forefront and then the question might be well</p>
<p t="2513210" d="2669">What should that singular value be and then?</p>
<p t="2516119" d="5940">Nietzsche would that ties it the whole argument back into the first sentences that he wrote at the beginning of the paragraph which is</p>
<p t="2522580" d="7099">Well, what is it that the philosopher is up to what is the force that he&#39;s serving? What is the unifying impulse?</p>
<p t="2529680" d="1350">That&#39;s another way of looking at it</p>
<p t="2531030" d="1230">If there&#39;s a unifying impulse</p>
<p t="2532260" d="7649">and he&#39;s not only fallen prey to some internal Demon if there&#39;s a unifying impulse to bring all of this together into some sort of</p>
<p t="2540790" d="2689">functional structure what exactly might that look like</p>
<p t="2547150" d="4040">“For every impulse is imperious, and as such, attempts to philosophise.”</p>
<p t="2551350" d="5059">That&#39;s part of that, sort of Nietzsche&#39;s idea of will to power</p>
<p t="2557230" d="3590">In its nascent form like all of these</p>
<p t="2562390" d="2000">unconscious entities that</p>
<p t="2564670" d="2000">inhabit that human psyche are all alive</p>
<p t="2566670" d="790">and</p>
<p t="2567460" d="4700">they&#39;re trying to live, they&#39;re trying to climb up the dominance hierarchy and</p>
<p t="2572280" d="3200">dominate because of course that&#39;s partly what life does because</p>
<p t="2576280" d="6469">Let&#39;s say from an evolutionary perspective, and this is probably more true for males because there are less</p>
<p t="2584920" d="2000">effective in their attempts to</p>
<p t="2587290" d="1710">replicate</p>
<p t="2589000" d="2000">the distinction between</p>
<p t="2591609" d="4490">Climbing up a dominance hierarchy whatever that might happen to be and success is</p>
<p t="2596950" d="2750">there may be no distinction at all and</p>
<p t="2600609" d="4250">then you might say well that just shows that there&#39;s nothing but will to power but</p>
<p t="2606400" d="3680">That still doesn&#39;t answer one of the most fundamental questions is that</p>
<p t="2611109" d="2120">Power in relationship to what?</p>
<p t="2614220" d="2000">Because that&#39;s the question</p>
<p t="2619240" d="2000">Okay, so you can shut that off.</p>
