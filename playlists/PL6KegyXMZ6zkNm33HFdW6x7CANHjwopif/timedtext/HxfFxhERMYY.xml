<p t="279" d="2000">Hi everyone,</p>
<p t="2400" d="5800">I should really be editing my book today, but I thought I&#39;d take a bit of time to respond</p>
<p t="8240" d="5020">to something that happened in the media today</p>
<p t="13269" d="4700">in the aftermath of James Damore&#39;s Google memo and all the coverage it received.</p>
<p t="18250" d="3559">A journalist named Steve Kovach wrote a story for business insider called</p>
<p t="22480" d="4500">&quot;Silicon Valley&#39;s liberal bubble has burst and the culture war has arrived&quot;.</p>
<p t="27580" d="4760">In that article, which discussed the memo, he characterized myself and</p>
<p t="33580" d="8420">Stefan Molyneux a well-known YouTube personality as far-right. What his article said specifically was, and I quote:</p>
<p t="42480" d="5180">&quot;YouTube which is ironically owned by Google and has become a hot spot for right-wing vloggers</p>
<p t="47920" d="6540">was the outlet of choice for Damore himself. His first public interviews were to Stefan Molyneux and Jordan B. Peterson,</p>
<p t="54640" d="4540">far-right figures who have built up large followings on the video site&quot;</p>
<p t="60040" d="4900">and I felt that that was inappropriate let&#39;s say to say the least</p>
<p t="65180" d="6220">and so I tweeted that and emailed him and said that that was a mischaracterization</p>
<p t="71460" d="7260">and asked him to justify his claims, and so what I&#39;m going to do is to read our email exchange to you, okay?</p>
<p t="78909" d="2599">And you can draw your own conclusions from it, so</p>
<p t="82900" d="3769">The first email, this is my email I said:</p>
<p t="88630" d="4250">&quot;Dear Mr. Kovach, you called me a far-right figure in press.</p>
<p t="93189" d="4130">You don&#39;t have one iota of proof for that statement, and it is patently untrue.</p>
<p t="97720" d="5440">I&#39;ve been lecturing, for example, about the dangers of National Socialist ideology for decades.</p>
<p t="103240" d="3100">Find a single thing I&#39;ve said that places me on the far right.</p>
<p t="106960" d="5600">In the absence of the smoking pistol, is that grounds for a lawsuit for defamation of character?</p>
<p t="113080" d="2120">Inquiring minds want to know.</p>
<p t="115200" d="3740">If you want to talk I&#39;m open to it, but you should watch your words.</p>
<p t="118940" d="3920">I&#39;m seriously unhappy about your careless and false characterization.</p>
<p t="123440" d="3140">Watch this for example, and see if it&#39;s &quot;far-right&quot;.</p>
<p t="126600" d="6520">I linked to a Youtube video of a lecture I gave on the temperamental basis of right-wing belief.</p>
<p t="133740" d="3600">So then Steve responded</p>
<p t="137440" d="3320">and he said &quot;How would you prefer to be characterized?&quot;</p>
<p t="141460" d="2059">Then he said &quot;Just saw your tweets.</p>
<p t="143519" d="6540">Please let me know what you would prefer&quot;, and so I said I would prefer the truth</p>
<p t="150080" d="4020">I would prefer that journalist such as yourself use absolute precision of language</p>
<p t="154120" d="2340">It&#39;s not up to me to tell you what that is</p>
<p t="156640" d="4680">It&#39;s up to you given your choice of profession, and this is no laughing matter,</p>
<p t="161320" d="4620">Mr. Kovach as you seem to imply with quote &quot;Please let me know what you prefer.&quot;</p>
<p t="166380" d="5699">End quote. I&#39;ve been fighting an intellectual war against radicals on the right and left for three decades.</p>
<p t="172079" d="5430">I have a very clear and public track record with regards to my attitude to the far right.</p>
<p t="177670" d="3559">I spend a lot of time and efforts, for example, in my first book, Maps of Meaning,</p>
<p t="181780" d="2989">outlining the psychopathology of National Socialists</p>
<p t="184769" d="5160">and have made my opposition to such things known in a manner both public and widely distributed.</p>
<p t="190239" d="3770">The fact that I&#39;m equally unhappy with the Gulag-type</p>
<p t="194319" d="4580">Leftists generally ignored by the modern postmodernists did not make me &quot;far right&quot;.</p>
<p t="199480" d="5780">I&#39;m seriously unhappy about being carelessly lumped in with people I despise and have spent my life fighting.</p>
<p t="206680" d="9240">He wrote back and said &quot;Thank you for your response, so the article is truthful and accurate, how would you like to be characterized?&quot;</p>
<p t="216880" d="1820">I said</p>
<p t="218709" d="5660">I said very clearly you mischaracterized me as far right. On what grounds whatsoever can you make that claim?</p>
<p t="224950" d="7610">And having made it, it is your responsibility to either justify the characterization with some investigation or to withdraw it and apologize.</p>
<p t="233530" d="2359">Politically, I&#39;m a classic British liberal</p>
<p t="236440" d="6470">Temperamentally, I&#39;m high in openness which tilts me to the left although I am also conscientious which tilts me to the right.</p>
<p t="243459" d="4250">Philosophically, I am an individualist not a collectivist of the right or the left.</p>
<p t="248590" d="7940">Metaphysically I&#39;m an American pragmatist who has been strongly influenced by the psychoanalytic and clinical thinking of Freud, Jung and the</p>
<p t="256900" d="2000">Psychotherapists who have followed in their wake</p>
<p t="258940" d="1220">There is simply nothing</p>
<p t="260160" d="7109">I have said or done that makes me far right quite the contrary I&#39;ve warned thousands of students over the course of three decades</p>
<p t="267460" d="2899">that the spirit of Auschwitz concentration camp</p>
<p t="270550" d="6259">Guards dwells in their heart and that they should do everything in their power to recognize its existence and overcome it</p>
<p t="277570" d="6800">Every single lecture of my maps of meaning course various versions which have now been watched or listened to by millions of people</p>
<p t="284770" d="2059">Make some variant of that point</p>
<p t="287140" d="7309">I&#39;ve also produced a series of individual self development programs now used by thousands of people to strengthen themselves as individuals</p>
<p t="295180" d="4250">Determine their proper and honorable destinies and live productive meaningful lives</p>
<p t="299920" d="4010">You didn&#39;t do your homework you cast a serious dispersion on my character</p>
<p t="303930" d="4589">I don&#39;t deserve it in the least I want you to do something about it</p>
<p t="310480" d="7489">He responds. Thank you for the clarification Jordan. I will correct the story and identify you as a classic British liberal I</p>
<p t="320320" d="3290">Responded I wrote this one before I received his response</p>
<p t="323740" d="4399">But I sent it after so I&#39;m keeping it in the order that it actually emerged</p>
<p t="328540" d="2630">Rather than in the order what it makes precise sense</p>
<p t="332050" d="4040">Dear Mr.. Kovach do you really think that if I were far-right</p>
<p t="336150" d="6869">I could have placed 200 university lectures online and taught for three decades at Harvard and at the University of Toronto</p>
<p t="343330" d="3529">without someone making a devastating case for my ideological</p>
<p t="347380" d="5270">Perversity? In what universe could that possibly occur I&#39;m a university professor</p>
<p t="353200" d="7760">Clinical psychologist and a public intellectual whose primary goal is the psychological and metaphysical strengthening and fortification of the individual</p>
<p t="361450" d="2000">I was still trying to clarify</p>
<p t="363730" d="3889">How I would like to be referred to literally nothing about that is far right</p>
<p t="367620" d="3360">I don&#39;t even care though that you called me that name in the last year</p>
<p t="370980" d="1320">I&#39;ve been called names by people</p>
<p t="372300" d="3540">And we made that kind of behavior a well practiced part of their professional</p>
<p t="375940" d="7940">Specialty what I care about is the fact that the name is wrong, and seriously wrong. You&#39;re engaged in a very important public debate. Handled incorrectly</p>
<p t="384460" d="4099">That debate will degenerate into conflict when you make an error</p>
<p t="388930" d="7130">Willful or otherwise you increase the possibility of catastrophe. I&#39;m calling your attention to such an error to put it bluntly you</p>
<p t="396580" d="2390">Are contributing to the dangerous political polarization?</p>
<p t="399730" d="1560">increasingly typifying</p>
<p t="401290" d="3139">discourse by vilifying my views and my character</p>
<p t="404560" d="5059">It appears that you have done so either carelessly or to add some narrative punch to your story</p>
<p t="409860" d="2000">Neither of these reasons are in the least</p>
<p t="412450" d="1140">justifiable</p>
<p t="413590" d="6920">post our email dialog publicly if you&#39;d like let the readers sort it out for themselves if you want to stick to your guns and</p>
<p t="421720" d="4040">Then I thought and replied that&#39;s okay all post the dialogue</p>
<p t="426400" d="6860">Screenshots to Twitter which I&#39;ve done Steve Kovach responded. Thanks for your help the story has been corrected and</p>
<p t="434410" d="2000">With that, Mr. Kovach</p>
<p t="437110" d="7699">Went online and changed his description of both ((((((Stefan Molyneux)))))), and I from as I had mentioned previously</p>
<p t="445870" d="3080">far-right to the current description which is</p>
<p t="449770" d="4939">Right leaning ((((((Stefan Molyneux)))))) and classic British Liberal Jordan B</p>
<p t="454870" d="5600">Peterson which I might point out is quite a substantial departure from the initial far-right</p>
<p t="460780" d="2929">You might think I&#39;d be pleased about the change and I suppose</p>
<p t="463710" d="5580">it&#39;s better the way it is than the way it was but I&#39;m not pleased at all with the fact that it happened or</p>
<p t="469660" d="2720">Really with the fact that it was changed so easily. It&#39;s like</p>
<p t="473560" d="1560">It&#39;s not a</p>
<p t="475120" d="1680">straightforward matter</p>
<p t="476800" d="6170">It&#39;s not a matter of no import to mischaracterize someone as far-right especially in today&#39;s political climate</p>
<p t="482980" d="7459">And it&#39;s indicative of what I would describe as loose journalistic ethics to put it mildly to then</p>
<p t="491650" d="3589">Be so willing to transform your terminology with no</p>
<p t="495520" d="4789">explanation to your reader and no apparent let&#39;s call it crisis of conscience or</p>
<p t="501880" d="7910">Or serious consideration of the meaning of your actions. Well, that&#39;s not good. Let&#39;s put it that way</p>
<p t="511570" d="7549">Anyways, you guys can apart from that commentary which I couldn&#39;t stop myself from making you guys can draw your own</p>
<p t="519400" d="6589">conclusions, and then one last thing I&#39;m not exactly sure what to make of the alt-right and</p>
<p t="531709" d="5780">and then one last thing I&#39;m not sure to what and</p>
<p t="538790" d="1799">Then one last thing</p>
<p t="540589" d="7820">I&#39;m not sure how to understand the alt-right or to characterize it or even to think know what to think about it&#39;s hypothetical</p>
<p t="548899" d="1410">existence</p>
<p t="550309" d="2210">Or my association with it</p>
<p t="552829" d="5720">but I can tell you that I&#39;m not in favor of people banding together in ideological groups and</p>
<p t="559730" d="2059">instead would much rather see</p>
<p t="562699" d="1950">people live</p>
<p t="564649" d="6979">Fundamentally productive and meaningful and honest individual lives and in that manner be a light unto their neighbors</p>
<p t="571629" d="1810">so to speak to</p>
<p t="573439" d="2000">Show the way to live in the world without</p>
<p t="576439" d="5240">Undue ideological possession and to move forward things productively in that Manner</p>
<p t="581680" d="3299">I don&#39;t know of any pathway forward through this</p>
<p t="585559" d="7220">Increasingly polarized political landscape that we find ourselves in that isn&#39;t absolutely rife with the possibility of conflict</p>
<p t="592779" d="5279">And if I haven&#39;t made that clear so far, I would certainly like to make it clear now</p>
<p t="598399" d="2210">So I would encourage those of you</p>
<p t="600610" d="7349">who are considering yourself say on the alt right for that matter as well as on the radical left to</p>
<p t="610309" d="2000">transcend your</p>
<p t="613339" d="5299">dangerous and impersonal ideological identification and start to live as true individuals in the world</p>
<p t="620420" d="4070">That&#39;s what I think and I hope that I&#39;ve been communicating that and if I haven&#39;t well</p>
<p t="624490" d="2669">I apologize because that&#39;s what I&#39;ve been trying to do</p>
