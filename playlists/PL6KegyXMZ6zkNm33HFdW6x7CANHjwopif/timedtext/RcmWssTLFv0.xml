<p t="8250" d="1620">We’re gonna review a proposition.</p>
<p t="9870" d="5620">Now, if I ever tell you something in enough
detail that you&#39;ve already heard that you’ve</p>
<p t="15490" d="6140">heard it enough, please tell me because I
can’t precisely remember what I told you.</p>
<p t="21630" d="5370">I know the line of the narrative throughout
the entire course, and we will return to some</p>
<p t="27000" d="5480">things fairly frequently, but I don&#39;t want
to tell you the same story three times, unless</p>
<p t="32480" d="3120">you’re particularly compelled by that story.</p>
<p t="35600" d="2480">So let me know.</p>
<p t="38080" d="6440">We’re going to start with a proposition,
and the proposition is that in order to orient</p>
<p t="44520" d="6110">yourself properly in life, there&#39;s two classes
of information you have to have access to.</p>
<p t="50630" d="5900">One class of information is information about
the nature of the objective world, and the</p>
<p t="56530" d="5259">objective world is described in a manner - or
the world when it is treated objectively - is</p>
<p t="61789" d="4281">described in a manner that strips all the
subjectivity from it.</p>
<p t="66070" d="2030">That’s the technology.</p>
<p t="68100" d="6490">The philosophical technology that&#39;s behind
the Scientific Revolution - involves stripping</p>
<p t="74590" d="8390">the subjectivity from the sense mediated consequences
of certain kinds of actions because when you</p>
<p t="82980" d="3740">lay out an experiment, you&#39;re not just talking
about what happened, you&#39;re talking about</p>
<p t="86720" d="2300">what you did and then what happened.</p>
<p t="89020" d="3680">And you&#39;re supposed to be able to do it in
a way that ensures that if someone else followed</p>
<p t="92700" d="4000">the exact same procedure, they would obviously
observe the same consequences.</p>
<p t="96700" d="7140">And, in some sense, we’re trying to establish
a realm of knowledge that is universally applicable</p>
<p t="103840" d="2900">to people despite their individual differences.</p>
<p t="106740" d="3420">That&#39;s one way of thinking about it, and obviously
that works.</p>
<p t="110160" d="5900">Whether or not it works in a Darwinian sense,
we still have to determine because it could</p>
<p t="116060" d="7171">easily be that our development of the scientific
method is what will make us go extinct, under</p>
<p t="123231" d="3528">which circumstances you might consider it
to have been an error.</p>
<p t="126759" d="7811">But it doesn&#39;t really matter at the moment
because so far so good, roughly speaking.</p>
<p t="134570" d="4740">Now, people think the world is an objective
place because we can describe it objectively,</p>
<p t="139310" d="5720">and that&#39;s a much more debatable presupposition.</p>
<p t="145030" d="6450">It’s partly debatable because it&#39;s actually
based on a decision in some sense, rather</p>
<p t="151480" d="6970">than evidence, partly because your knowledge
is finite in every direction in some sense.</p>
<p t="158450" d="4920">So what that means in a way is no matter what
you know about anything, you don&#39;t know everything</p>
<p t="163370" d="1250">about that thing.</p>
<p t="164620" d="2730">And so, you kind of ground out in ignorance
at some point.</p>
<p t="167350" d="4320">So what means is you that you have to buttress
your thinking with a set of assumptions that</p>
<p t="171670" d="3930">you don&#39;t question or you just end up in an
infinite regress.</p>
<p t="175600" d="7060">One of those sets of assumptions is usually
reality definition sets of assumptions, or</p>
<p t="182660" d="4719">truth definition sets of assumptions, but
the thing is generally no matter what your</p>
<p t="187379" d="4771">theory of reality is, or what your theory
of truth is, there are alternative theories</p>
<p t="192150" d="5229">of reality and alternative theories of truth
that are equally rigorous and that have different</p>
<p t="197379" d="1991">domains of application.</p>
<p t="199370" d="11259">And it’s a very tricky business, so for
example, if you&#39;re a reductionist materialist,</p>
<p t="210629" d="8711">you&#39;re going to make the presupposition that
brain physiology is more real than emotional</p>
<p t="219340" d="1030">experience.</p>
<p t="220370" d="5179">I suppose that&#39;s in some sense because you
can&#39;t get access to someone else’s emotional</p>
<p t="225549" d="4601">experiences, at least not directly whereas
you can get universal access to the fundamental</p>
<p t="230150" d="1690">details of someone’s brain physiology.</p>
<p t="231840" d="1650">It’s something like that.</p>
<p t="233490" d="6620">Anyways now, that&#39;s still an arbitrary assumption
because the person and you as well are going</p>
<p t="240110" d="4650">to be acting all the time as if your emotions
and motivational states are real and so then</p>
<p t="244760" d="4619">you run into a problem and the problem is
well, how do you know what someone actually</p>
<p t="249379" d="1000">believes?</p>
<p t="250379" d="6271">You listen to what they say or do you listen
to their explicit and well articulated theories,</p>
<p t="256650" d="1750">or do you watch how they act?</p>
<p t="258400" d="8430">And the answer to that is, you make your choice
and generally there are reasons for that.</p>
<p t="266830" d="9040">Now, one of the conceptual tools that I have
found helpful in my attempts to avoid confusion</p>
<p t="275870" d="3440">when dealing with the fact that there are
very many ways of looking at the world is</p>
<p t="279310" d="7410">to start thinking about theories of reality
as tools rather than descriptions and I find</p>
<p t="286720" d="3680">that extraordinarily useful as a metaphor.</p>
<p t="290400" d="4560">If you have a toolbox full of tools, you don&#39;t
necessarily try to reduce the utility of one</p>
<p t="294960" d="4200">tool to another and you don&#39;t actually complain
that all tools aren&#39;t the same.</p>
<p t="299160" d="6039">A wrench isn&#39;t a very good hammer, but that
doesn&#39;t mean you can criticize it on that</p>
<p t="305199" d="1000">grounds.</p>
<p t="306199" d="5041">You might not want to use it as a hammer,
although you could I suppose, but it’s not</p>
<p t="311240" d="3821">a justifiable criticism, and it looks to me
- and this is something that a psychologist</p>
<p t="315061" d="3939">named George Kelly pointed out as well, although
I think it’s also an element of pragmatic</p>
<p t="319000" d="7090">philosophy is that one set of tools for one
thing, and another set of tools for another</p>
<p t="326090" d="1390">thing.</p>
<p t="327480" d="5560">That’s helpful, that’s helpful.</p>
<p t="333040" d="3659">And then you are also thinking about the sorts
of problems that you might solve with different</p>
<p t="336699" d="5261">forms of tools, and one problem is what are
things made of - in an objective sense let’s</p>
<p t="341960" d="1000">say.</p>
<p t="342960" d="6019">And another problem might be what is the landscape
of experience, and that&#39;s more of a phenomenological</p>
<p t="348979" d="1000">problem.</p>
<p t="349979" d="2171">That’s the problem the phenomenologists
set out, and then the other problem might</p>
<p t="352150" d="6070">be how do you, and should you conduct yourself.</p>
<p t="358220" d="5479">And it could easily be that you can&#39;t use
the same tool to solve all of those problems,</p>
<p t="363699" d="5611">and I would say particularly true, technically,
when you&#39;re dealing with science because science</p>
<p t="369310" d="5169">in its very nature refuses to answer questions
about what it is that you should do, apart</p>
<p t="374479" d="4440">from some implicit assumption that you should
do science which is actually not -</p>
<p t="378919" d="5851">Well that’s actually not a scientific assumption,
by the way, because it’s a moral assumption,</p>
<p t="384770" d="5530">and the moral assumption is that if you conduct
yourself in a scientific manner, things will</p>
<p t="390300" d="4670">be better because why would you run around
doing science to make things worse, although</p>
<p t="394970" d="2349">you absolutely can.</p>
<p t="397319" d="5891">And, we perhaps are, and even if we aren’t,
we still might.</p>
<p t="403210" d="4609">So that&#39;s one of the things I find quite interesting
about the scientific endeavor, and this is</p>
<p t="407819" d="4271">something Jung observed was that it had to
be nested in something outside of itself to</p>
<p t="412090" d="1040">be given its motive force.</p>
<p t="413130" d="5539">It had to be nested in a system of moral assumptions,
and the fundamental moral assumption is the</p>
<p t="418669" d="4150">world will be a better place if we conduct
ourselves along scientific lines, because</p>
<p t="422819" d="1421">why do it?</p>
<p t="424240" d="4450">And that&#39;s a statement that cannot be analyzed
from within the confines of the scientific</p>
<p t="428690" d="3410">worldview because it doesn&#39;t analyze those
sorts of questions.</p>
<p t="432100" d="5400">Now, you can say they&#39;re not real, but that&#39;s
a stupid answer because - I think it’s a</p>
<p t="437500" d="2940">cop out, maybe it’s not a stupid answers,
but it probably is.</p>
<p t="440440" d="5670">At least it’s a cop out because if you don&#39;t
take that question seriously, you can&#39;t really</p>
<p t="446110" d="2330">justify engaging in the activity.</p>
<p t="448440" d="3580">So you could refuse to answer it but you&#39;re
basically answering it by engaging in the</p>
<p t="452020" d="7769">activity anyways so even if you&#39;re not saying
it, you&#39;re still justifying it.</p>
<p t="459789" d="3521">Assuming you can draw conclusions from people’s
actions like you can from their statements</p>
<p t="463310" d="2810">- and it’s hard to really dispute that I
would say.</p>
<p t="466120" d="5110">If you&#39;re wise, in fact, I think you derive
more conclusions from their actions than their</p>
<p t="471230" d="1390">statements.</p>
<p t="472620" d="8609">So that’s the underbelly of the first proposition,
and the development of that is something like</p>
<p t="481229" d="7481">the means by which information is transmitted
that is relevant to the domain of behavior</p>
<p t="488710" d="5260">is not the same means by which it’s transmitted
- by which scientific information is transmitted.</p>
<p t="493970" d="6229">And we kinda know that too, without any real
debate, I believe, because how old do you</p>
<p t="500199" d="3120">think science is as a technical endeavor?</p>
<p t="503319" d="5201">What would you estimate?</p>
<p t="508520" d="3559">Hundreds of years.</p>
<p t="512079" d="3661">Maybe thousands of years if you’re willing
to give the Greeks some credit, but really</p>
<p t="515740" d="1070">probably not.</p>
<p t="516810" d="5750">Probably hundreds because Aristotle wasn&#39;t
a scientist - like he wasn&#39;t a bad observer,</p>
<p t="522560" d="4230">but he certainly wasn&#39;t an empirical observer,
and no one got science straightened out till</p>
<p t="526790" d="5180">what - Newton, Descartes, Bacon, and you know
there&#39;s a handful of other characters who</p>
<p t="531970" d="2080">were thinking around that period of time.</p>
<p t="534050" d="6330">They sort of established the proper methods,
really, and also the philosophy that underlies</p>
<p t="540380" d="1000">it.</p>
<p t="541380" d="1000">It’s not very old.</p>
<p t="542380" d="1000">Six hundred years, you know, five hundred
years.</p>
<p t="543380" d="1000">That’s really nothing.</p>
<p t="544380" d="2850">It’s the blink of an eye.</p>
<p t="547230" d="1680">It’s yesterday, if that.</p>
<p t="548910" d="2870">It might even be an hour ago.</p>
<p t="551780" d="5642">It’s nothing, but obviously people were
transmitting information about how to act</p>
<p t="557422" d="6858">to each other for untold millennia before
that, and it’s probably more like - it depends</p>
<p t="564280" d="8920">on what you&#39;re willing to consider transmission
of information, but even octopi couldn&#39;t imitate,</p>
<p t="573200" d="1470">and they&#39;re the smartest invertebrate.</p>
<p t="574670" d="1480">They’re quite bright, those things.</p>
<p t="576150" d="5499">They only live a couple of years so they can&#39;t
really get things going.</p>
<p t="581649" d="1000">They can problem solve.</p>
<p t="582649" d="3451">They can pull corks out of bottles to get
like a crab in a bottle, and if they watch</p>
<p t="586100" d="4220">an octopus - if an octopus watches another
octopus pull a cork out of a bottle to get</p>
<p t="590320" d="6070">a tasty crab, then that octopus knows how
to do it, which is pretty impressive.</p>
<p t="596390" d="4350">And you could kind of see why octopi can kind
of do that because not only do they have a</p>
<p t="600740" d="3810">brain, but they also have little tentacle-y
appendages which allow them to manipulate</p>
<p t="604550" d="1000">things.</p>
<p t="605550" d="5590">So, one of the precursors to being able to
be intelligent in any act of way is that you</p>
<p t="611140" d="5340">have to have tentacle-y appendages so you
can manipulate the world.</p>
<p t="616480" d="3490">At least for it to be anything resembling
what we would consider to be intelligence,</p>
<p t="619970" d="3850">and that&#39;s part of the reason dolphins aren&#39;t
really as intelligent as people like to think</p>
<p t="623820" d="1550">because what are they gonna do?</p>
<p t="625370" d="2340">They can&#39;t build cities with their flippers.</p>
<p t="627710" d="5360">They&#39;re kinda trapped in their test tube bodies,
and the same thing applies to whales.</p>
<p t="633070" d="4740">Obviously they have very large brains, and
they&#39;re very social, and they can learn, but</p>
<p t="637810" d="3890">whatever their intelligence is, it’s not
like our intelligence because we run around</p>
<p t="641700" d="5060">tearing things apart and putting them back
together and we’ve got the body for that.</p>
<p t="646760" d="5100">So anyways, long before we were practicing
science, we were doing perfectly well, in</p>
<p t="651860" d="4510">a sense, without any real knowledge of the
objective world at all - at least not any</p>
<p t="656370" d="2290">scientific knowledge about the objective world.</p>
<p t="658660" d="4989">So another thing you might observe about that
is that you can survive perfectly well without</p>
<p t="663649" d="4471">knowing any science at all, in an articulated
and developed manner.</p>
<p t="668120" d="2909">Of course animals are in that category.</p>
<p t="671029" d="6131">So, that also, I think in some sense, undermines
the claim of science to anything approaching</p>
<p t="677160" d="4590">a universal truth because obviously life can
get along perfectly well without it.</p>
<p t="681750" d="2591">Now it depends on some degree whether you’re
a Darwinian or a Newtonian.</p>
<p t="684341" d="1000">Perhaps the unwillingness to commence on what
people should do is one feature of modern</p>
<p t="685341" d="21429">science than it is of science in general because
I’m thinking someone like Clifford.</p>
<p t="706770" d="3180">I don’t know if you know his essay on belief.</p>
<p t="709950" d="1170">I don’t, no.</p>
<p t="711120" d="5480">Oh okay, well his maxim is that basically
it’s wrong always for anyone everywhere</p>
<p t="716600" d="3140">to believe anything on his push to evidence.</p>
<p t="719740" d="2510">And he sort of tries to prove it - he’s
a mathematician.</p>
<p t="722250" d="2260">He tries to prove it on a moral basis.</p>
<p t="724510" d="1250">Of course, it’s not scientific.</p>
<p t="725760" d="5019">That kind of claim can’t be scientific but
Yeah, well I mean obviously the people who</p>
<p t="730779" d="4250">began the Scientific Revolution thought of
it as part of a moral movement.</p>
<p t="735029" d="1711">I mean it was part of the enlightenment.</p>
<p t="736740" d="6289">It was part of bringing clarity to our conceptualizations
of the world and that was supposed to be a</p>
<p t="743029" d="5961">positive thing, but the only issue is that
claim seems to be outside of the claim on</p>
<p t="748990" d="1659">science, in some sense.</p>
<p t="750649" d="3000">Anyways, you get the picture with regard to
the argument.</p>
<p t="753649" d="10551">Okay, now the next step might be if you need
or can utilize or there exists information</p>
<p t="764200" d="5970">that is not strictly scientific, one might
be, well, where did that information come</p>
<p t="770170" d="1000">from?</p>
<p t="771170" d="1000">That&#39;s a good one.</p>
<p t="772170" d="1380">How is it transmitted?</p>
<p t="773550" d="1099">That&#39;s another one.</p>
<p t="774649" d="4211">And the worst of it is, of course, how might
it be verified?</p>
<p t="778860" d="3810">Because one of the issues - one of the things
that scientists have really got down, and</p>
<p t="782670" d="4801">it’s a major deal, is that they can lay
forth a theory of truth and they they can</p>
<p t="787471" d="5308">operate within that theory of truth and pretty
much everyone can agree on what it is.</p>
<p t="792779" d="3011">The more well established the science, the
more that’s the case.</p>
<p t="795790" d="4670">Like people don’t really doubt Einstein’s
- people really don’t doubt quantum theory</p>
<p t="800460" d="4100">anymore, and you guys don’t doubt it because
there you are using your computers and you</p>
<p t="804560" d="4469">wouldn’t be able to use your computers if
quantum theory wasn&#39;t right, so it’s certainly</p>
<p t="809029" d="1000">right enough.</p>
<p t="810029" d="5381">But enough more impressively than that, whenever
someone’s tried to prove it wrong, in any</p>
<p t="815410" d="7900">possible way, even in its most bizarre predictions
over the last hundred and some years, it’s</p>
<p t="823310" d="2370">passed every test with flying colors.</p>
<p t="825680" d="4530">So you know, you can make pretty damn solid
truth claims from within the scientific perspective,</p>
<p t="830210" d="4470">but the problem is that it’s a lot harder
to do that from within a moral perspective</p>
<p t="834680" d="3270">and there&#39;s all sorts of reasons for that.</p>
<p t="837950" d="7160">One reason might be that there&#39;s a certain
amount of situational complexity related to</p>
<p t="845110" d="3000">every moral question that you can&#39;t reduce.</p>
<p t="848110" d="7270">For example, imagine if you&#39;re a clinical
psychologist and you&#39;re listening to two people</p>
<p t="855380" d="6829">who know each other very well, maybe husband
and wife, discuss their last argument.</p>
<p t="862209" d="4440">And you might say - well you might think - well
let&#39;s get to the bottom of this.</p>
<p t="866649" d="2911">Let&#39;s find out what this argument is about.</p>
<p t="869560" d="5719">You might think, if you were scientifically
inclined, that it is in fact about something</p>
<p t="875279" d="4810">which means that if you investigated long
enough, you can actually figure out what the</p>
<p t="880089" d="4321">facts are, but I actually don&#39;t believe that&#39;s
true.</p>
<p t="884410" d="2830">And the reason I don’t think it’s true
is this.</p>
<p t="887240" d="3529">Imagine you have a - there’s this old joke
about these two friends.</p>
<p t="890769" d="5091">They&#39;re like 85 years old and they&#39;re sitting
on the park bench feeding the pigeons, and</p>
<p t="895860" d="5419">one friend says to the other “64,” and
the other guy cracks up and laughs like mad</p>
<p t="901279" d="1000">about that.</p>
<p t="902279" d="3891">Then the other guy says “83,” then the
other guy cracks up and laughs about that,</p>
<p t="906170" d="3560">and some guy’s watching them and wondering
what in the world is going on.</p>
<p t="909730" d="4060">So the person comes over to these old guys
and says what’s the scoop here?</p>
<p t="913790" d="4090">All you’re doing is sitting there saying
numbers to each other and then you’re laughing</p>
<p t="917880" d="2899">uproariously and I just don&#39;t get it.</p>
<p t="920779" d="4111">And they said, well we’ve known each other
so long that we’ve heard each other’s</p>
<p t="924890" d="4340">jokes at least a hundred times and so we have
them completely memorized, and so a couple</p>
<p t="929230" d="4060">of years ago we decided we’d just number
the damn things and it would take a lot less</p>
<p t="933290" d="3270">time to tell then and we could laugh more
that way.</p>
<p t="936560" d="6529">So, it’s an interesting little joke because
it sheds some light on the nature of deep</p>
<p t="943089" d="6121">relationships, and if you have a deep relationship
with someone, here’s how you can think about</p>
<p t="949210" d="1090">it.</p>
<p t="950300" d="4490">Imagine you&#39;re trying to analyze an essay,
and I’ve actually built an essay writing</p>
<p t="954790" d="5109">module which is on my site - 230 website.</p>
<p t="959899" d="3401">I don’t remember which template it is but
I’ll tell you in a while.</p>
<p t="963300" d="5060">It’s based on this theory of meaning, roughly
speaking, and you should use it to write your</p>
<p t="968360" d="2870">essay because if you do, it’ll be a way
better essay.</p>
<p t="971230" d="1219">Here’s the issue.</p>
<p t="972449" d="3911">If you&#39;re reading an essay, where is the meaning?</p>
<p t="976360" d="5700">Well, that’s a hard one because it might
be a hard one.</p>
<p t="982060" d="4170">So, the question might be badly formulated
in some sense because it might be many places.</p>
<p t="986230" d="2440">But, let’s think it through logically.</p>
<p t="988670" d="4190">Well you need the letters if it’s written
in alphabetic script.</p>
<p t="992860" d="3969">So obviously some of the meaning is in the
letters, and then the letters are combined</p>
<p t="996829" d="3771">in certain particular ways and that gives
you some words, and the words are combined</p>
<p t="1000600" d="3620">in some particular ways and that gives you
phrases, and the phrases are joined together</p>
<p t="1004220" d="5380">in sentences, and the sentences are strung
together in some reasonably coherent manner.</p>
<p t="1009600" d="3710">So they kind of go from start to end in a
paragraph, and then the paragraphs are strung</p>
<p t="1013310" d="5000">together in a coherent manner to make up the
totality of the essay.</p>
<p t="1018310" d="4100">One of the things I noticed when I tried to
figure out how to grade essays and how to</p>
<p t="1022410" d="5529">assess them is that you could do a good or
a bad job at any one of those levels.</p>
<p t="1027939" d="6551">Like a really bad essay is full of spelling
mistakes, the words are inappropriate because</p>
<p t="1034490" d="3449">the person doesn&#39;t actually understand them
so they&#39;re awkwardly used, the phrases are</p>
<p t="1037939" d="4520">put together in a cliched manner, the sentence
structure isn&#39;t good.</p>
<p t="1042459" d="4580">The sentences aren&#39;t even in the right paragraphs,
much less organized properly.</p>
<p t="1047039" d="5441">The paragraphs don&#39;t flow from one to another
in what might be called - that’s kind of</p>
<p t="1052480" d="1930">where the skeleton of the story is.</p>
<p t="1054410" d="4590">It’s sort of the most important level in
some sense, and even if that wasn&#39;t all wrong</p>
<p t="1059000" d="3000">there’s actually no idea there anyways.</p>
<p t="1062000" d="8539">And then you can also read essays that have
one or more of those flaws or some combination</p>
<p t="1070539" d="1000">of all of them.</p>
<p t="1071539" d="4671">So very frequently, I’d read a student’s
essays and this often happens with smart,</p>
<p t="1076210" d="8630">creative students who are very badly educated,
and that would be probably fifty percent of</p>
<p t="1084840" d="2120">the people in this class, I would bet.</p>
<p t="1086960" d="4240">I say that for genuine reasons because I run
a fourth year seminar where I have people</p>
<p t="1091200" d="6020">write extensively, so what they do is they
write a four page essay, and then I complain</p>
<p t="1097220" d="4260">about it at all those levels of analysis,
and then they write the same essay again in</p>
<p t="1101480" d="2220">six pages, and then I do the same thing, and
then I do the same thing and then they do</p>
<p t="1103700" d="6130">the same thing in eight pages, and half of
the first essays are terrible.</p>
<p t="1109830" d="1890">That&#39;s partly because students do triage.</p>
<p t="1111720" d="2620">They think, well do I really have to work
in this course?</p>
<p t="1114340" d="4920">I’ll try a bit and if I get slapped, I’ll
work a little harder, and if I don’t, I’ll</p>
<p t="1119260" d="3760">devote my time to other courses which is a
perfectly reasonable thing to do, but some</p>
<p t="1123020" d="1900">of it is just pure inability.</p>
<p t="1124920" d="3240">But what is really fascinating is by the end
of the course is that all of the students</p>
<p t="1128160" d="5149">are writing well, and it’s pathetic as far
as I’m concerned because it meant that everybody</p>
<p t="1133309" d="4181">could have been taught to write ten years
ago but they weren&#39;t.</p>
<p t="1137490" d="5270">Anyways if you look at this template that
I laid out, then it will help you in this</p>
<p t="1142760" d="8980">because it walks you through the process of
writing properly.</p>
<p t="1151740" d="2850">So now and then I would read an essay and
everything is wrong about it, but there&#39;s</p>
<p t="1154590" d="5030">a really smart about it, and knowing this
multilevel idea with regards to meaning, I</p>
<p t="1159620" d="3580">can say, look you’re smarter than you can
write.</p>
<p t="1163200" d="3940">There&#39;s really something here, but here&#39;s
all the things that are wrong with it.</p>
<p t="1167140" d="4030">Then you get a worse situation in some sense
where everything about the essay is good but</p>
<p t="1171170" d="3490">the idea isn’t, and so the words are good,
the phrases.</p>
<p t="1174660" d="3510">The sentences are right, and it goes together
but it adds up to nothing.</p>
<p t="1178170" d="4430">And those are hard to grade because you give
them a C maybe or a B, cause I’d probably</p>
<p t="1182600" d="3770">give them a B, and the person comes up and
says, where did I make a mistake?</p>
<p t="1186370" d="5900">It’s like, well you didn&#39;t really make a
mistake, you just didn&#39;t do anything right,</p>
<p t="1192270" d="3210">and that&#39;s a whole different problem.</p>
<p t="1195480" d="2500">So you think, that’s pretty complex with
regards to an essay.</p>
<p t="1197980" d="1000">Where’s the meaning?</p>
<p t="1198980" d="2670">But that isn&#39;t where the meaning is.</p>
<p t="1201650" d="2520">Here, let me give you an example.</p>
<p t="1204170" d="1360">I was thinking of this the other day.</p>
<p t="1205530" d="4330">So, the ethnicity and the cultural backgrounds
of my students have changed quite radically</p>
<p t="1209860" d="1220">over the years.</p>
<p t="1211080" d="4150">When I started teaching this course for example
- and my personality course as well which</p>
<p t="1215230" d="3990">would have been thirty years ago - I can take
it for granted that everyone in the room would</p>
<p t="1219220" d="3699">know the basic biblical stories, and they
would know the Judeo-Christian version of</p>
<p t="1222919" d="2261">them and not, say the Islamic version of them.</p>
<p t="1225180" d="5920">Well that&#39;s gone, and that&#39;s really made it
difficult for me in some ways because there&#39;s</p>
<p t="1231100" d="1000">a bunch of things.</p>
<p t="1232100" d="5180">There’s a bunch of collective knowledge
that might constitute a shared set of cultural</p>
<p t="1237280" d="3831">assumptions that I can no longer presume and
it means there&#39;s all sorts of things that</p>
<p t="1241111" d="7189">I can&#39;t talk about or if I’m going to talk
about, I have to step way back and start from</p>
<p t="1248300" d="1790">first principles let’s say.</p>
<p t="1250090" d="4920">So that’s also made me think because if
I - let’s say you write me an essay and</p>
<p t="1255010" d="1980">let’s say it’s a Psychology essay.</p>
<p t="1256990" d="3069">Now you&#39;re gonna presume that there&#39;s a whole
bunch of things I know about Psychology that</p>
<p t="1260059" d="1911">you also know.</p>
<p t="1261970" d="3770">And the reason you&#39;re going to presume that
is because, well we come - for the purpose</p>
<p t="1265740" d="5870">of this conversation - we come from the same
cultural background and what that means is</p>
<p t="1271610" d="5929">we share a set of assumptions, and we don&#39;t
have to say what those assumptions are.</p>
<p t="1277539" d="3811">We can assume them and then we can talk about
the things that we disagree about, and of</p>
<p t="1281350" d="2939">course that&#39;s what you&#39;re doing when you&#39;re
writing an essay or having a conversation</p>
<p t="1284289" d="1000">right?</p>
<p t="1285289" d="4111">You&#39;re saying well obviously we don&#39;t have
to talk about what we know because we already</p>
<p t="1289400" d="1000">know it.</p>
<p t="1290400" d="4230">We want to push that a little bit so we start
to talk a little bit about the things we don’t</p>
<p t="1294630" d="6070">know, but no more so than we both understand.</p>
<p t="1300700" d="3350">So then you think damn it, the meaning of
the essay isn’t in the essay at all.</p>
<p t="1304050" d="4410">It’s in the interaction between the shared
cultural assumptions between the writer and</p>
<p t="1308460" d="2490">the reader and the essay.</p>
<p t="1310950" d="3680">Well and then you think, it’s worse than
that even because the shared cultural assumptions</p>
<p t="1314630" d="8080">are in their own sort of network, and then
that&#39;s nested inside a very an extraordinarily</p>
<p t="1322710" d="6690">broad biological network and it’s like actually,
you can continue expanding the outer reaches</p>
<p t="1329400" d="4230">of the essay without limit.</p>
<p t="1333630" d="5270">So part of that means it’s actually impossible
to specify the meaning of the essay.</p>
<p t="1338900" d="6350">It’s something you both work at in combination,
as writer and as reader, but it’s very fluid</p>
<p t="1345250" d="1460">and flexible.</p>
<p t="1346710" d="4800">That problem is partly why the post modernists
got going because they sort of noticed this.</p>
<p t="1351510" d="5899">Corrupt as they are, they did notice at one
point that it was very very difficult to say</p>
<p t="1357409" d="8111">what any given phrase, paragraph, or essay
mean because it wasn&#39;t there - like it’s</p>
<p t="1365520" d="1140">not in the book.</p>
<p t="1366660" d="6840">It’s sort of in the book, but - you know
this too if you listen to a piece of music.</p>
<p t="1373500" d="4940">So let’s say you had a favorite song when
you were fourteen, and when you first heard</p>
<p t="1378440" d="3800">that song, maybe you didn’t like it that
much, but you maybe heard it four times and</p>
<p t="1382240" d="1770">thought man that’s one excellent song.</p>
<p t="1384010" d="4330">Then at some point, you&#39;ve heard it so many
times that you never want to hear it again.</p>
<p t="1388340" d="4219">That’s interesting too because it means
the song has transformed in relationship to</p>
<p t="1392559" d="6641">your historical interactions with it and you
might say, no this song is the same.</p>
<p t="1399200" d="3310">Well, it depends on what you mean by the song.</p>
<p t="1402510" d="2000">The notes are the same.</p>
<p t="1404510" d="3020">The experience has certainly transformed.</p>
<p t="1407530" d="3680">So anyways, back to the couple that are sitting
there talking.</p>
<p t="1411210" d="2579">They&#39;re having this argument and they&#39;re trying
to sort out what this is about.</p>
<p t="1413789" d="4380">Well the problem is it’s about everything
the argument is about plus everything that’s</p>
<p t="1418169" d="3931">ever happened to them in their relationship.</p>
<p t="1422100" d="6510">If someone has told you the same thing fifty
times, it is not the same thing as the thing</p>
<p t="1428610" d="1870">they told you the first time.</p>
<p t="1430480" d="4830">God only knows how many transformations it’s
gone through as it’s been continually repeated,</p>
<p t="1435310" d="4359">and how many different arguments it’s been
embedded in, and how many things you’d have</p>
<p t="1439669" d="3360">to know to understand the shades of intonation
in all of that.</p>
<p t="1443029" d="7541">But basically each utterance a couple produces
is - it’s meaning is determined by the entire</p>
<p t="1450570" d="3570">history of interactions that those two people
have had.</p>
<p t="1454140" d="2760">So, how are you going to specify that?</p>
<p t="1456900" d="2899">It’s very very difficult to specify it.</p>
<p t="1459799" d="5521">Now, you really can’t, and it’s also difficult
to know when you’ve specified it enough.</p>
<p t="1465320" d="7770">You know, one of the things that is interesting
training as a psychoanalyst is that it started</p>
<p t="1473090" d="7390">to become absolutely mind boggling how much
archaeology you can undertake underneath a</p>
<p t="1480480" d="5250">single statement, especially if it’s delivered
with a bit of edge and some contempt.</p>
<p t="1485730" d="6130">It’s like there’s just levels and levels
and levels and levels of meaning underneath</p>
<p t="1491860" d="3780">that, and you can tell that when you’re
engaged in an argument like that because someone</p>
<p t="1495640" d="6290">will trigger you, let’s say, for lack of
a better word, and they’ll have broken a</p>
<p t="1501930" d="3530">rule that you have established with them and
you’re both in a pit.</p>
<p t="1505460" d="5040">The fight is about that pit, even though maybe
it’s about some surface thing, and you&#39;re</p>
<p t="1510500" d="3280">just running around there like rats that are
lit on fire and there’s nothing you can</p>
<p t="1513780" d="1070">do about it.</p>
<p t="1514850" d="5900">And it’s a consequence of all the issues
that are lurking beneath the surface of that</p>
<p t="1520750" d="3610">speech act that seemed to be something - you
could capture it on a video.</p>
<p t="1524360" d="2000">You can say, well here’s what you said.</p>
<p t="1526360" d="1640">There&#39;s a video tape recording of it.</p>
<p t="1528000" d="4820">It’s like no, that&#39;s not what you said because
the videotape cannot capture the context,</p>
<p t="1532820" d="1000">and it can’t.</p>
<p t="1533820" d="4550">So you can&#39;t even get an objective record
of the meaning of the conversation because</p>
<p t="1538370" d="3070">the meaning isn’t right in the conversation.</p>
<p t="1541440" d="2260">Okay so that’s one of the problems.</p>
<p t="1543700" d="4260">One of the problems we’re trying to validate
moral claims is that you’ve got this insane</p>
<p t="1547960" d="5850">contextual complexity that’s almost impossible
to dispose of, and so you can say - you can</p>
<p t="1553810" d="5359">even say that if person A did action A in
situation A, that’d be right and then person</p>
<p t="1559169" d="3731">B did action A in situation A, that would
be wrong.</p>
<p t="1562900" d="3730">It would depend on the person, and so it’s
very easy to slip from that into a kind of</p>
<p t="1566630" d="4960">moral relativism because how in the world
do you deal with the complexity and how do</p>
<p t="1571590" d="1750">you make a truth claim?</p>
<p t="1573340" d="5630">So I would really say in some sense that’s
the intellectual situation in modern universities.</p>
<p t="1578970" d="4230">Now, the other thing that’s kind of interesting
is that this was actually discovered in a</p>
<p t="1583200" d="6270">number of modern fields simultaneously, so
just as the literary theorists started to</p>
<p t="1589470" d="5480">discover, say after World War II, that it
wasn’t enough to say that a book had meaning</p>
<p t="1594950" d="1000">in it.</p>
<p t="1595950" d="3000">Like there was something wrong with that,
and there isn&#39;t even a single meaning, there’s</p>
<p t="1598950" d="4500">a multiplicity of meanings and it isn&#39;t even
a stable multiplicity of meanings, people</p>
<p t="1603450" d="3250">were finding that out in other domains as
well.</p>
<p t="1606700" d="6589">For example in artificial intelligence where
it became very obvious, very rapidly that</p>
<p t="1613289" d="5020">perceiving a simple object was not simple
because objects aren’t simple, and the border</p>
<p t="1618309" d="2990">between one object and another is in some
sense arbitrary.</p>
<p t="1621299" d="5292">I mean, when I look at each of you, I sort
of see you as entities, but that’s because</p>
<p t="1626591" d="3859">I see you at this level of resolution.</p>
<p t="1630450" d="3089">You&#39;re cellular masses at a different level
of resolution.</p>
<p t="1633539" d="3880">You&#39;re molecular composites at a different
level of resolution.</p>
<p t="1637419" d="7091">You’re made up of ten times as many bacteria
as cells at another level of resolution, so</p>
<p t="1644510" d="3180">really you’re more like an ocean than you
are like an entity.</p>
<p t="1647690" d="3730">And then, well is it you or your family that’s
the real.</p>
<p t="1651420" d="2150">Or is it you, your family, and your culture?</p>
<p t="1653570" d="5370">What about your species, or are you a mammal.</p>
<p t="1658940" d="6700">It’s like all of those things and any of
those things at the same time, so when I look</p>
<p t="1665640" d="3500">at you, what am I supposed to see?</p>
<p t="1669140" d="9440">Do I see individual with name or do I see
ethnicity or do I see - well you get the picture.</p>
<p t="1678580" d="4540">So object perception turns out to be extraordinarily
difficult because things aren&#39;t just simple</p>
<p t="1683120" d="4410">objects even if they’re relatively simple.</p>
<p t="1687530" d="3480">So, you throw your hands.</p>
<p t="1691010" d="2289">You think how can there be any harmony.</p>
<p t="1693299" d="2471">How can you draw some sort of sense from that?</p>
<p t="1695770" d="3730">Okay, so that’s the argument against drawing
any sense out of it.</p>
<p t="1699500" d="2200">But then, let’s try the other attack.</p>
<p t="1701700" d="6710">Let’s see if we can make a case for there
being some claims of - that moral claims can</p>
<p t="1708410" d="1000">be validated.</p>
<p t="1709410" d="3249">Okay, so here’s a question for you.</p>
<p t="1712659" d="3411">If you took a bunch of chimpanzees that didn&#39;t
know each other and you threw them in this</p>
<p t="1716070" d="3020">classroom, what you would have is a war.</p>
<p t="1719090" d="1000">Right.</p>
<p t="1720090" d="5620">Now, you&#39;re roughly in that situation, not
exactly because A - you’re not chimpanzees,</p>
<p t="1725710" d="6660">but you know your genetic material is quite
reasonably related.</p>
<p t="1732370" d="4020">You only split off your common ancestors seven
million years ago, and that seems like a long</p>
<p t="1736390" d="2680">time and it is, but it’s not three hundred
million years ago.</p>
<p t="1739070" d="4229">It’s still relatively recently from the
evolutionary perspective.</p>
<p t="1743299" d="2750">Here you all are, you don’t really know
each other.</p>
<p t="1746049" d="3291">You obviously share important elements of
identity.</p>
<p t="1749340" d="3770">So you’re all students, and you can come
in here and all of a sudden you all know what</p>
<p t="1753110" d="2400">to do, and no one fights.</p>
<p t="1755510" d="4149">Or if they do fight, it’s - there are very
constrained rules around the fighting and</p>
<p t="1759659" d="6010">everyone accepts them, and it seems hard to
say that’s not better than the alternative.</p>
<p t="1765669" d="8151">So unless you wanna come in here and have
an absolute chaotic war.</p>
<p t="1773820" d="4340">Somehow we’ve managed to figure out how
we can figure out how to bring relative strangers</p>
<p t="1778160" d="4720">together in a relatively high pressure situation
because we’re learning about complicated</p>
<p t="1782880" d="4600">and challenging things, and everybody gets
along.</p>
<p t="1787480" d="1510">And everybody’s kind of happy about that.</p>
<p t="1788990" d="5240">So it looks like we can figure out patterns
of behavior that, well, then the question</p>
<p t="1794230" d="1300">is, are they correct?</p>
<p t="1795530" d="1470">Are they morally correct?</p>
<p t="1797000" d="2260">Are they right, or did they work?</p>
<p t="1799260" d="4140">And you might also ask yourself what’s the
difference between all of those claims, is</p>
<p t="1803400" d="3200">there similarity or difference between those
claims.</p>
<p t="1806600" d="4260">So, and then you might ask yourself - okay
so here’s something else you might think</p>
<p t="1810860" d="1770">about.</p>
<p t="1812630" d="5200">So, let’s say you’re playing Monopoly.</p>
<p t="1817830" d="2290">How many of you have played Monopoly in your
life?</p>
<p t="1820120" d="2820">Okay, is there anyone here who hasn&#39;t played
Monopoly?</p>
<p t="1822940" d="1000">Excellent.</p>
<p t="1823940" d="3350">A cultural universal.</p>
<p t="1827290" d="9220">So, obviously in some ways it doesn&#39;t matter
if you get all those little hotels right?</p>
<p t="1836510" d="5570">But, on the other hand if you act like it
doesn&#39;t matter while you&#39;re playing Monopoly,</p>
<p t="1842080" d="3650">then people hit you with things and they should
because part of the rule is that you&#39;re gonna</p>
<p t="1845730" d="3610">act like this matters because if you don&#39;t,
then it’s not any fun.</p>
<p t="1849340" d="5290">So you have to act like it matters and then
it turns out when you start playing, it matters.</p>
<p t="1854630" d="3590">People will actually - they’ll get angry,
especially if you cheat.</p>
<p t="1858220" d="1309">But people will play Monopoly.</p>
<p t="1859529" d="2520">They’ll act as if the endpoint matters.</p>
<p t="1862049" d="2860">You might say, well what is the endpoint?</p>
<p t="1864909" d="6561">And one answer is to get all the hotels and
all the money, so you enter the 1%, so you</p>
<p t="1871470" d="4010">have all the wealth and no one has any, and
so you win and you feel happy about that,</p>
<p t="1875480" d="3600">even if you&#39;re a radical left winger.</p>
<p t="1879080" d="2949">So that&#39;s kind of interesting.</p>
<p t="1882029" d="1551">Then you say, well that&#39;s not really the point.</p>
<p t="1883580" d="5640">The point is to enjoy the game, and you say
yeah okay that’s probably the point too.</p>
<p t="1889220" d="2480">And you might say, well that&#39;s not really
the point either.</p>
<p t="1891700" d="4190">You want to hone your negotiating skills.</p>
<p t="1895890" d="2520">You want to spend some time with your friends.</p>
<p t="1898410" d="4290">There&#39;s lots of things going on at once, but
it doesn&#39;t really matter because Monopoly</p>
<p t="1902700" d="1829">is a game that you’ll play.</p>
<p t="1904529" d="8241">Now imagine instead that Monopoly - here&#39;s
the new rule for Monopoly.</p>
<p t="1912770" d="5590">All the people you&#39;re playing with can randomly
steal your hotels and houses and your money</p>
<p t="1918360" d="4140">whenever they want, and you can steal it back.</p>
<p t="1922500" d="9140">So then you think, well no one’s gonna play
that game, and then you think well why not?</p>
<p t="1931640" d="6110">Well, the first surface answer is that’s
a stupid game, and you know that somehow.</p>
<p t="1937750" d="4230">You think that’s a stupid game, but then
you start to think about well why is that</p>
<p t="1941980" d="1000">a stupid game?</p>
<p t="1942980" d="4530">Or you might say it’s an unplayable game
which would be a little bit more sophisticated.</p>
<p t="1947510" d="1810">Why would that not work?</p>
<p t="1949320" d="3680">And you might say, well what’s the point
in getting all the hotels if someone could</p>
<p t="1953000" d="1760">just take them?</p>
<p t="1954760" d="2580">But you might say what’s the point in getting
the hotels anyway?</p>
<p t="1957340" d="1429">Like who cares about the damn hotels.</p>
<p t="1958769" d="1621">So it’s a bit tricky.</p>
<p t="1960390" d="5070">There’s something about the randomness of
what’s now allowed and the unpredictability</p>
<p t="1965460" d="5210">of it and the arbitrary nature of it and its
lack of a relationship with your own actions</p>
<p t="1970670" d="3030">that takes all the motivational impetus out
of the game.</p>
<p t="1973700" d="5579">So one thing we might think about to begin
with, is there’s a difference between a</p>
<p t="1979279" d="6591">good game and a bad game, and there&#39;s also
a difference between a game and no game.</p>
<p t="1985870" d="4990">And we don’t know what the difference is
exactly, but there is a difference.</p>
<p t="1990860" d="4480">We might even say not only are there good
games and bad games, some good games are better</p>
<p t="1995340" d="1319">than other games.</p>
<p t="1996659" d="3201">How many of you have played Settlers of Catan?</p>
<p t="1999860" d="3449">Okay, is that better than Monopoly or worse?</p>
<p t="2003309" d="1340">Student says: It’s better.</p>
<p t="2004649" d="1000">better.</p>
<p t="2005649" d="1941">Does anyone think it’s not better?</p>
<p t="2007590" d="3360">Okay, why is it better?</p>
<p t="2010950" d="3010">What’s better about it?</p>
<p t="2013960" d="11319">It’s more complex and the part where you
said - I mean it’s not necessarily stealing</p>
<p t="2025279" d="2561">but there’s a piece of the game in there,
I think it’s like the robber or something</p>
<p t="2027840" d="1000">like that.</p>
<p t="2028840" d="1000">Yeah, there’s a robber.</p>
<p t="2029840" d="1000">Student says: And you place him on one of
the tiles.</p>
<p t="2030840" d="2079">You can mess with people, so that’s fun.</p>
<p t="2032919" d="2071">It is fun.</p>
<p t="2034990" d="2600">It’s like I’m gonna get you with a robber.</p>
<p t="2037590" d="6030">It’s more akin to real like I think, like
in Monopoly</p>
<p t="2043620" d="1890">No, that’s reasonable.</p>
<p t="2045510" d="2080">It’s also got a strategic element.</p>
<p t="2047590" d="3999">How many of you play Risk?</p>
<p t="2051589" d="5550">Okay, Settlers of Catan or Risk?</p>
<p t="2057139" d="2040">Okay, two Risk diehards.</p>
<p t="2059179" d="1480">What about the rest of you?</p>
<p t="2060659" d="1680">How many are for Risk?</p>
<p t="2062339" d="1181">Two.</p>
<p t="2063520" d="1579">How many for Settlers of Catan.</p>
<p t="2065099" d="1461">Okay, okay.</p>
<p t="2066560" d="4660">Well, Settlers of Catan is a bit like Risk
because it has a strategic element and there&#39;s</p>
<p t="2071220" d="4630">a territorial expansion that goes along with
it, and there’s also trading which is one</p>
<p t="2075850" d="2880">of the things that&#39;s nice about Monopoly and
about Risk.</p>
<p t="2078730" d="5120">Okay but well, you can see - you have intuitions
about what constitutes a better game and part</p>
<p t="2083850" d="4640">of the way you develop those intuitions is
not exactly philosophical because I doubt</p>
<p t="2088490" d="4189">if you really thought through why Settlers
of Catan is a better game than, say, Risk</p>
<p t="2092679" d="5711">or Monopoly for those of that think it does,
but you watch your own reaction and your own</p>
<p t="2098390" d="4300">reaction is okay well I’d rather play Settlers
of Catan.</p>
<p t="2102690" d="2750">You might ask yourself why, but you don’t
have to.</p>
<p t="2105440" d="2950">You’d just rather play it.</p>
<p t="2108390" d="3080">So then you think well what does it mean that
you’d rather play it?</p>
<p t="2111470" d="2990">Well it’s more fun, it’s more enjoyable.</p>
<p t="2114460" d="4050">If asked voluntarily, that&#39;s the one I would
pick, but you really don&#39;t know why, apart</p>
<p t="2118510" d="7460">from those reasons but obviously those are
complex - that’s a complex social engagement,</p>
<p t="2125970" d="1000">those games.</p>
<p t="2126970" d="1000">They’re complex.</p>
<p t="2127970" d="6681">In fact they’re so complex, you can have
preferences and not even know why, and that’s</p>
<p t="2134651" d="1000">interesting.</p>
<p t="2135651" d="5769">I think the idea that there are games, good
games and bad games and games and non-games,</p>
<p t="2141420" d="4740">is a nice way of starting to conceptualize
what the difference might be between moral</p>
<p t="2146160" d="3560">systems because a game is actually a moral
system.</p>
<p t="2149720" d="1430">It has a point.</p>
<p t="2151150" d="1750">It has an end.</p>
<p t="2152900" d="5700">You have to cooperate and compete to run through
the game.</p>
<p t="2158600" d="8580">So awhile back, a psychologist actually started
this and it’s reprehensible, but psychologists</p>
<p t="2167180" d="3950">have done lots of reprehensible things and
this is one of them.</p>
<p t="2171130" d="3470">This psychologist, whose name I don&#39;t remember
at the moment, was reviewing the literature</p>
<p t="2174600" d="5970">on the difference in aggression between boys
and girls and men and women.</p>
<p t="2180570" d="5150">Boys and men are much more aggressive, depending
on how you define as aggressive, than girls</p>
<p t="2185720" d="1230">and women.</p>
<p t="2186950" d="4320">Now that tends to be mostly true with physical
aggression.</p>
<p t="2191270" d="4099">So you might say kicking, hitting, biting,
punching, stealing.</p>
<p t="2195369" d="4961">Two year old boys for example - two year olds,
the ones who do most of that are boys.</p>
<p t="2200330" d="4590">Now, the two year old girls are cutting each
other up behind their backs but no one measures</p>
<p t="2204920" d="1000">that.</p>
<p t="2205920" d="4760">So you find for example, with female aggression
it tends to be relationship savaging, and</p>
<p t="2210680" d="2100">you see that in the playground.</p>
<p t="2212780" d="1000">You see it in junior high.</p>
<p t="2213780" d="1730">You see it in high school, and you see it
on the net.</p>
<p t="2215510" d="1870">It’s always the same thing.</p>
<p t="2217380" d="4400">Whether men are more aggressive than women,
it depends on how you define aggression, but</p>
<p t="2221780" d="2220">men are more physically aggressive anyways.</p>
<p t="2224000" d="8740">Awhile back, there was this idea that maybe
we could dampen down the male aggression by</p>
<p t="2232740" d="5920">socializing little boys more like little girls,
and one of the offshoots of that was that</p>
<p t="2238660" d="3459">we should only let children play cooperative
games.</p>
<p t="2242119" d="4351">Now, the first thing you might notice is that
anything you might have done as a game was</p>
<p t="2246470" d="1780">not cooperative.</p>
<p t="2248250" d="5220">Right, like it’s not a game if it’s just
cooperative, but then the other thing you</p>
<p t="2253470" d="5200">might notice is that the distinction between
a cooperative and a competitive game is far</p>
<p t="2258670" d="4010">more sophisticated than people that come up
with those dimwitted theories of how to improve</p>
<p t="2262680" d="2020">the world would ever appreciate.</p>
<p t="2264700" d="2350">So here’s an example.</p>
<p t="2267050" d="2270">Is hockey a game?</p>
<p t="2269320" d="1000">Yes.</p>
<p t="2270320" d="1000">Is it an aggressive game?</p>
<p t="2271320" d="1000">Yes.</p>
<p t="2272320" d="1000">Is it a competitive game?</p>
<p t="2273320" d="1000">Yes.</p>
<p t="2274320" d="1000">Is it a cooperative game?</p>
<p t="2275320" d="1000">Yes.</p>
<p t="2276320" d="1000">Aha.</p>
<p t="2277320" d="1000">Why?</p>
<p t="2278320" d="1000">Why is it a cooperative game?</p>
<p t="2279320" d="1900">Because you have to work together.</p>
<p t="2281220" d="2010">Right, so there&#39;s the team right.</p>
<p t="2283230" d="4030">You’re also obviously cooperating with your
team members, but you&#39;re also maybe trying</p>
<p t="2287260" d="4140">to be the best player, but you&#39;re also trying
to be the best player in a way that doesn&#39;t</p>
<p t="2291400" d="4920">irritate the hell out of your team players
right, because there&#39;s something about that</p>
<p t="2296320" d="1180">that’s counter productive.</p>
<p t="2297500" d="5711">Like, even if you&#39;re a good player and you’re
a prima donna and you hog the puck, say, and</p>
<p t="2303211" d="4819">maybe you&#39;re not interested in the development
of your other team members, like you’re</p>
<p t="2308030" d="2270">not a good player even if you are the most
talented.</p>
<p t="2310300" d="2110">So, there’s obviously a cooperative element.</p>
<p t="2312410" d="1760">Is there a cooperative element beyond that?</p>
<p t="2314170" d="5800">Well yeah, you have to all agree to sort of
cooperate in so much as agreeing to the rules</p>
<p t="2319970" d="2330">of the game and playing it.</p>
<p t="2322300" d="1000">Right.</p>
<p t="2323300" d="2320">You don&#39;t bring a chessboard or a basketball.</p>
<p t="2325620" d="1000">Right.</p>
<p t="2326620" d="4710">No matter if you&#39;re on different teams because
you&#39;re all there to play hockey.</p>
<p t="2331330" d="4580">So just to play hockey is a cooperative endeavor
because think of all the other things you</p>
<p t="2335910" d="2270">could be doing instead of playing hockey at
that time.</p>
<p t="2338180" d="3540">You could be doing an infinite number of other
things so really if you look at the relationship</p>
<p t="2341720" d="6859">between cooperation and competition in any
collaborative human affair, things are usually</p>
<p t="2348579" d="3901">competitive at one level, cooperative at another,
competitive at another, like there’s this</p>
<p t="2352480" d="5160">continual interplay between competition and
cooperation and you can&#39;t disentangle them.</p>
<p t="2357640" d="4400">Now one of the things that Piaget said - Piaget
is a, for those of you who don’t know and</p>
<p t="2362040" d="4270">you probably all do know, is perhaps the foremost
developmental psychologist of the 20th century</p>
<p t="2366310" d="3320">even though he didn&#39;t think he was a psychologist.</p>
<p t="2369630" d="5320">Piaget actually made the claim, the radical
claim, that two year olds for example - this</p>
<p t="2374950" d="3540">isn’t Piaget’s claim but it’s associated.</p>
<p t="2378490" d="2950">If you put people together, and their age
matched.</p>
<p t="2381440" d="5350">So you got a group of nine months olds, say,
one year olds, two year olds, three year olds,</p>
<p t="2386790" d="3890">all the way up to eighteen, and you just throw
them in a room, maybe with some things of</p>
<p t="2390680" d="6110">them to do and you count the number of violent
acts, which is kicking, hitting, biting, or</p>
<p t="2396790" d="1000">stealing.</p>
<p t="2397790" d="6010">Okay, two year olds, they’re the most violent
human beings and most of them aren&#39;t actually</p>
<p t="2403800" d="1420">violent.</p>
<p t="2405220" d="1450">There&#39;s a subset of them that are violent.</p>
<p t="2406670" d="3930">It’s about five to ten percent of them,
and almost all of them are boys, and then</p>
<p t="2410600" d="5830">if you track those boys across time, over
the next two years most of them become civilized</p>
<p t="2416430" d="3770">and the ones that don&#39;t never become civilized.</p>
<p t="2420200" d="3930">So they&#39;re kind of antisocial throughout their
childhood, and then when testosterone kicks</p>
<p t="2424130" d="5449">in at about fourteen and all the boys get
antisocial again, they catch up to the always</p>
<p t="2429579" d="5131">antisocial boys and the normal boys taper
off quite dramatically at around nineteen</p>
<p t="2434710" d="3840">and flatten right out at about twenty seven
but the antisocial boys, they just keep being</p>
<p t="2438550" d="1290">antisocial.</p>
<p t="2439840" d="11659">So now, Piaget noted that there was a dramatic
transformation in behavior - individual behavior</p>
<p t="2451499" d="4661">- in relationship to the social world between
the ages of two and four.</p>
<p t="2456160" d="5560">And, if you watch two year olds play together,
what they did fundamentally is like a parallel</p>
<p t="2461720" d="1070">play.</p>
<p t="2462790" d="4430">So maybe, there&#39;s one two year old there and
another two year old there and that two year</p>
<p t="2467220" d="3859">old is playing truck and this two year old
is playing ambulance or something or maybe</p>
<p t="2471079" d="4331">playing doll, and they&#39;re sitting with each
other, and maybe they interact a little bit</p>
<p t="2475410" d="3159">but they&#39;re not playing the same game.</p>
<p t="2478569" d="6861">Okay so, what they&#39;re doing in some sense
is they&#39;re engaged in a goal directed activity,</p>
<p t="2485430" d="3020">and it has a point.</p>
<p t="2488450" d="6190">They&#39;re sort of integrating all their interior
sub personalities in a sense that allows them</p>
<p t="2494640" d="3390">to play a single game with themselves.</p>
<p t="2498030" d="6201">That&#39;s pretty complex from a cognitive perspective
because they&#39;re not fractionated, and they&#39;re</p>
<p t="2504231" d="6319">not being pulled out by hunger or anger or
sadness or fear or any of those things, and</p>
<p t="2510550" d="4970">they&#39;re doing something that&#39;s highly complex
cognitively and they can organize themselves</p>
<p t="2515520" d="2770">well enough to do it for a substantial period
of time.</p>
<p t="2518290" d="1670">So it’s like it’s a major developmental
advance.</p>
<p t="2519960" d="2900">But they can&#39;t do it with another person.</p>
<p t="2522860" d="6440">Now one of Piaget’s hypotheses was that
they couldn&#39;t do it - they couldn&#39;t play the</p>
<p t="2529300" d="7319">same game with another person without actually
setting up a competitive structure so actually</p>
<p t="2536619" d="3220">competition was a prerequisite to competition.</p>
<p t="2539839" d="5471">The idea was okay so, if you watch how kids
do this, you can get a sense of it.</p>
<p t="2545310" d="5410">I mean, on the one hand they all get together
and they decide how to play tag.</p>
<p t="2550720" d="5040">Everyone knows the rules for tag, and you
can win at tag, but without the point - the</p>
<p t="2555760" d="4450">point in some sense is the construction of
a dominance hierarchy of competence.</p>
<p t="2560210" d="2909">Someone wins and then there are sort of the
people who are second best and third best,</p>
<p t="2563119" d="2171">and everybody&#39;s really into doing that.</p>
<p t="2565290" d="2363">You all have to get together if you&#39;re kids
and you say well what should we do.</p>
<p t="2567653" d="3837">You decide, well, we’re gonna play tag and
then you set up the rules because there’s</p>
<p t="2571490" d="3720">infinite variations of tag, and everyone goes
off and play.</p>
<p t="2575210" d="4380">So it’s a competitive game because only
one person can win, or maybe one at a time</p>
<p t="2579590" d="1370">can win.</p>
<p t="2580960" d="3860">But once you’ve all agreed on that, then
you’re cooperating.</p>
<p t="2584820" d="4770">So that’s quite interesting, and Piaget
regarded that as a necessary stage of the</p>
<p t="2589590" d="2700">ability to act like a social creature.</p>
<p t="2592290" d="4289">Here’s something that happens if you’re
not a very popular kid.</p>
<p t="2596579" d="4201">Let’s say four kids are playing Jacks.</p>
<p t="2600780" d="1100">Good enough.</p>
<p t="2601880" d="2270">I don&#39;t think kids play Jacks anymore but
whatever.</p>
<p t="2604150" d="3949">If they were playing Jacks, they’re sittings
there playing Jacks, and when you play Jacks,</p>
<p t="2608099" d="3911">you bounce a ball and you pick up a jack,
and if you manage that and a ball - if you</p>
<p t="2612010" d="3190">manage that, you drop the ball and pick up
two jacks and drop the ball, and you keep</p>
<p t="2615200" d="3399">going up till like eight jacks or whatever.</p>
<p t="2618599" d="4891">So now another kid wants to play Jacks, and
we’ll say this is a relatively popular kid</p>
<p t="2623490" d="4070">and so the kid sidles up to the group that’s
playing and sits down because they&#39;re all</p>
<p t="2627560" d="5490">sitting down and then watches, and then maybe
watches jack-playing motions or a couple of</p>
<p t="2633050" d="5600">comments about how the Jacks game is going,
and maybe the other kids don&#39;t have to disrupt</p>
<p t="2638650" d="3500">what they&#39;re doing very much and they can
kind of open the circle, and let that kid</p>
<p t="2642150" d="3449">scoot in and he gets to, or she gets to play
Jacks too.</p>
<p t="2645599" d="3921">Whereas a kid that doesn&#39;t - and that often
doesn&#39;t happen, even if it’s a popular kid.</p>
<p t="2649520" d="3030">Sometimes the little group that&#39;s already
formed won’t open and let them in.</p>
<p t="2652550" d="1770">You&#39;ve been to cocktail parties.</p>
<p t="2654320" d="1330">It’s exactly the same thing.</p>
<p t="2655650" d="1650">It’s exactly the same thing.</p>
<p t="2657300" d="3809">So you’re supposed to hang around the edge
of the conversation and maybe if you&#39;ve got</p>
<p t="2661109" d="5121">something that isn&#39;t too stupid to say, you
can offer it and maybe they’d let you in.</p>
<p t="2666230" d="5160">Okay, now if you&#39;re maybe not very social,
what you do is stand out there and you don&#39;t</p>
<p t="2671390" d="4410">notice what the hell is going on and you don&#39;t
start to match your body to what’s happening,</p>
<p t="2675800" d="3630">and maybe you say, I don&#39;t want to play Jacks,
that&#39;s a stupid game.</p>
<p t="2679430" d="3921">Let&#39;s go do something else, in which case
the kids are not happy with you, and you&#39;re</p>
<p t="2683351" d="1279">unpopular.</p>
<p t="2684630" d="1000">And that’s that.</p>
<p t="2685630" d="4150">You&#39;re stuck with it because if you&#39;ve got
that by the time you’re four, the other</p>
<p t="2689780" d="3460">kids are gonna leave you so far in the dust
you’re never going to catch up.</p>
<p t="2693240" d="3089">Okay, so what have we concluded from that?</p>
<p t="2696329" d="3931">We might conclude that people play games.</p>
<p t="2700260" d="1550">There&#39;s lots of different games.</p>
<p t="2701810" d="2570">There’s lots of different playable games.</p>
<p t="2704380" d="3430">There might even be an infinite number of
playable games.</p>
<p t="2707810" d="3590">There&#39;s a lot of non playable games, those
are the ones that aren’t any fun, and there&#39;s</p>
<p t="2711400" d="2380">a lot of interactions that aren’t games.</p>
<p t="2713780" d="5559">Okay so we can all accept that, and then we’ve
added to that the observation, or the presupposition,</p>
<p t="2719339" d="7260">the ability to play games is a prerequisite
for being socialized, so being able to operate</p>
<p t="2726599" d="4191">together with people and that that operation
has elements of competition and elements of</p>
<p t="2730790" d="1500">cooperation.</p>
<p t="2732290" d="1510">Reasonable?</p>
<p t="2733800" d="5520">And then you might say, well everything people
do communally has a game like aspect, and</p>
<p t="2739320" d="4210">you might say well that&#39;s actually why kids
like to play games because kids play games</p>
<p t="2743530" d="5510">because games are a simplified analog of life,
and if you get good at playing games - well</p>
<p t="2749040" d="4210">what happens is that the games you play are
increasingly complex and more and more real</p>
<p t="2753250" d="4460">world like until they&#39;re actually indistinguishable
from acting in the world.</p>
<p t="2757710" d="8210">But they&#39;re even then they&#39;re still games
in a sense because they could - the rules</p>
<p t="2765920" d="1000">could be different.</p>
<p t="2766920" d="2670">But then, you might think well are there things
that couldn’t be different?</p>
<p t="2769590" d="1300">Well, yeah there are some things.</p>
<p t="2770890" d="1280">It’s gonna be cooperative.</p>
<p t="2772170" d="1409">It’s gonna be competitive.</p>
<p t="2773579" d="1961">There&#39;s gonna be rules.</p>
<p t="2775540" d="2000">Everybody needs to agree on the rules.</p>
<p t="2777540" d="1190">People have to want to play.</p>
<p t="2778730" d="1790">This is something else Piaget observed.</p>
<p t="2780520" d="1450">It’s bloody brilliant.</p>
<p t="2781970" d="6780">He thought well, how can you decide if one
game is better than another.</p>
<p t="2788750" d="4890">Let’s say that&#39;s a moral claim in a sense,
but he wanted to narrow it down so that it</p>
<p t="2793640" d="2160">was possible it could be answered.</p>
<p t="2795800" d="5150">What he said was imagine you have group A
that was attempting to obtain a goal, and</p>
<p t="2800950" d="2169">group B that are attempting to attain a goal.</p>
<p t="2803119" d="4531">Both groups have agreed that attaining the
goal is valuable.</p>
<p t="2807650" d="2439">We don’t have to argue about the value of
the goal.</p>
<p t="2810089" d="1301">We’ve settled that.</p>
<p t="2811390" d="4570">Okay now, we’re going to make a further
assumption which is all things considered,</p>
<p t="2815960" d="4010">getting towards the goal with less effort,
more enjoyment, and less trouble would be</p>
<p t="2819970" d="1000">better.</p>
<p t="2820970" d="3250">Okay, you have to take that as a given because
it might not be.</p>
<p t="2824220" d="2129">Sometimes something difficult is better.</p>
<p t="2826349" d="7281">Well then you might say okay, would people
working voluntarily or involuntarily be more</p>
<p t="2833630" d="5600">likely be able to reach that goal with less
misery faster and more effectively.</p>
<p t="2839230" d="4700">Piaget’s answer was if you could get people
to play the game voluntarily, you don&#39;t have</p>
<p t="2843930" d="5899">to waste effort on enforcement, no one kicks
back so the system is going to be more efficient</p>
<p t="2849829" d="1221">across time.</p>
<p t="2851050" d="7559">Now that’s smart because he’s got a way
of conceptualizing what might constitute a</p>
<p t="2858609" d="1521">better system.</p>
<p t="2860130" d="3510">Now it’s grounded in subjective experience
in some degree.</p>
<p t="2863640" d="5180">Less misery, more enjoyment, but there&#39;s also
a way of measuring it.</p>
<p t="2868820" d="5990">It’s also more efficient, or it does what
it’s supposed to do with less noise and</p>
<p t="2874810" d="1000">grief.</p>
<p t="2875810" d="1150">Less cost, let’s say.</p>
<p t="2876960" d="2560">So that’s pretty smart.</p>
<p t="2879520" d="8020">Okay, so then let’s make another - well
how old do you think kids games are?</p>
<p t="2887540" d="4570">And I don’t know what’s happened to kids
in recent years because their culture has</p>
<p t="2892110" d="5870">somewhat been seriously disrupted by television
and computer, but you guys are a lot younger</p>
<p t="2897980" d="1000">than me.</p>
<p t="2898980" d="2040">Did you play hide and go seek?</p>
<p t="2901020" d="2150">You know ring around the rosie?</p>
<p t="2903170" d="1000">You know that.</p>
<p t="2904170" d="1000">Do you know what that is?</p>
<p t="2905170" d="1000">You don’t know Ring Around the Rosie.</p>
<p t="2906170" d="1659">How many people don’t know that.</p>
<p t="2907829" d="3731">Ring around the rosie, pockets full of posies,
hush ah hush ah, we all fall down?</p>
<p t="2911560" d="1800">Okay, how many know that.</p>
<p t="2913360" d="1690">It’s an English nursery rhyme.</p>
<p t="2915050" d="1350">It’s about the plague.</p>
<p t="2916400" d="2850">It’s about the black plague by the way.</p>
<p t="2919250" d="4950">And so, that piece of doggerel, that piece
of rhyme has been around, transmitted by the</p>
<p t="2924200" d="2990">oral culture of children since the time of
the black plague.</p>
<p t="2927190" d="5510">And so a lot of children’s tradition is
in the oral tradition, and a lot of the games</p>
<p t="2932700" d="3639">children play are passed along by children.</p>
<p t="2936339" d="2121">Kids learn how to play hide and go seek.</p>
<p t="2938460" d="4020">And how many of you played tag?</p>
<p t="2942480" d="1400">Anyone never play tag?</p>
<p t="2943880" d="2840">Right, so everyone plays tag.</p>
<p t="2946720" d="3330">How would you conceptualize tag if you were
a biologist?</p>
<p t="2950050" d="3410">What do you think children are doing?</p>
<p t="2953460" d="2630">They’re hunting.</p>
<p t="2956090" d="1930">They&#39;re chasing things down, obviously.</p>
<p t="2958020" d="1370">They&#39;re chasing things down.</p>
<p t="2959390" d="3770">Now hide and go seek, that’s a tougher one,
but it’s certainly exploration.</p>
<p t="2963160" d="4370">They’re exploring the landscape, and they&#39;re
matching wits with one another, but - and</p>
<p t="2967530" d="3430">they&#39;re also trying to see if - you know,
do people like you enough to actually find</p>
<p t="2970960" d="4480">you, which is a helpful thing to know if you&#39;re
four years old.</p>
<p t="2975440" d="6500">So anyways, children pass these games down
across the centuries.</p>
<p t="2981940" d="3370">Maybe tag is one of those games you don&#39;t
even have to pass down.</p>
<p t="2985310" d="4230">Children might just invent it spontaneously
with every generation because you can more</p>
<p t="2989540" d="2590">or less play tag with a dog.</p>
<p t="2992130" d="5900">I mean, the dog doesn&#39;t quite get it, but
it’s close.</p>
<p t="2998030" d="6789">Okay, so there are some games that are enjoyable
enough that they&#39;re either transmitted and</p>
<p t="3004819" d="5161">everyone knows them very rapidly, or they&#39;re
so close to our nature we can just reinvent</p>
<p t="3009980" d="3700">them and I think tag is the classic example
of that.</p>
<p t="3013680" d="4399">So that’s interesting too because what it
means is that there’s certain types of competitive</p>
<p t="3018079" d="1951">and cooperative behavior.</p>
<p t="3020030" d="5790">Those are elementary moral systems that are
- they look like they&#39;re integral to our nature.</p>
<p t="3025820" d="4499">You can even say they&#39;re built right in, or
you might say they&#39;re so close to built in</p>
<p t="3030319" d="5191">that it doesn&#39;t take much of an introduction
for the roles of the game before everybody’s</p>
<p t="3035510" d="1270">pretty happy with it.</p>
<p t="3036780" d="1930">You see this with a lot of things.</p>
<p t="3038710" d="2510">You play peek-a-boo with a baby.</p>
<p t="3041220" d="1260">Okay so what are the rules?</p>
<p t="3042480" d="1700">What are the rules of peek-a-boo.</p>
<p t="3044180" d="5179">You cover your eyes.</p>
<p t="3049359" d="1101">You cover your eyes.</p>
<p t="3050460" d="1099">Okay so that’s right.</p>
<p t="3051559" d="1731">You go like this.</p>
<p t="3053290" d="1990">Okay then what’s the next rule?</p>
<p t="3055280" d="2190">That’s right.</p>
<p t="3057470" d="1000">You reveal your eyes.</p>
<p t="3058470" d="1820">You don&#39;t just sit there like this.</p>
<p t="3060290" d="5180">Now you can play a trick on a baby if you
want, and babies will laugh about this sort</p>
<p t="3065470" d="2350">of thing which is really, I think, quite amazing.</p>
<p t="3067820" d="2880">A baby’s laugh is something remarkable to
me.</p>
<p t="3070700" d="4880">So you can go like this, and then like this
and then like this and then like this and</p>
<p t="3075580" d="5130">then you can do this, and the baby will laugh
because that&#39;s a little variation eh.</p>
<p t="3080710" d="3430">Or you can go like this.</p>
<p t="3084140" d="1729">Right.</p>
<p t="3085869" d="2701">And then the baby - well that’ll even make
you guys laugh.</p>
<p t="3088570" d="3630">That’s good, you can see how deeply rooted
this is.</p>
<p t="3092200" d="2440">So you know but, eventually what’ll the
baby do?</p>
<p t="3094640" d="3870">It’ll grab your hands, pull them down because
you&#39;re breaking the damn rules.</p>
<p t="3098510" d="4620">And the baby knows the rules even though you’ve
never established any rules, and you can get</p>
<p t="3103130" d="1969">the rules going with about five reps.</p>
<p t="3105099" d="1270">You say okay, this.</p>
<p t="3106369" d="3000">Maybe no one’s ever played peek-a-boo with
a baby.</p>
<p t="3109369" d="1440">The baby figures it out right away.</p>
<p t="3110809" d="2861">This, this, and then you vary that.</p>
<p t="3113670" d="1000">Maybe do that.</p>
<p t="3114670" d="3910">That baby thinks that’s a hell of a good
joke, you know, cause you went up instead</p>
<p t="3118580" d="3630">of down, and so it’s variations within this
rule bound theme.</p>
<p t="3122210" d="3690">It’s kind of musical in a sense, there’s
variations in the theme.</p>
<p t="3125900" d="1840">Now what you don’t do is go.</p>
<p t="3127740" d="1000">Waahh!</p>
<p t="3128740" d="4400">Cause that’ll just short it right out.</p>
<p t="3133140" d="7260">So you don&#39;t do that unless you’re, you
know, unless you have an evil streak in you.</p>
<p t="3140400" d="4050">So there&#39;s certainly ways of violating the
baby’s expectations and what the baby will</p>
<p t="3144450" d="4169">do if you do that is startle and they startle
with their whole bodies, and then look at</p>
<p t="3148619" d="3240">you and probably they’ll burst into tears.</p>
<p t="3151859" d="3821">But some babies will just laugh like mad if
something like that happens, and you can find</p>
<p t="3155680" d="4741">those babies all over YouTube, right, because
you get the baby that the mother sneezes and</p>
<p t="3160421" d="2889">the baby has a fit laughing for like ten minutes.</p>
<p t="3163310" d="2200">But it’s quite interesting.</p>
<p t="3165510" d="3030">One of the things about babies that I’ve
never been able to understand is the staggering</p>
<p t="3168540" d="3280">sophistication of their senses of humor.</p>
<p t="3171820" d="1350">Like it’s deep eh?</p>
<p t="3173170" d="2581">Cause even a nine month old baby can play
tricks on you.</p>
<p t="3175751" d="5209">So, you know they&#39;re baby tricks, but still,
they’re tricks and they laugh and they&#39;re</p>
<p t="3180960" d="2020">quite comical and they like variation.</p>
<p t="3182980" d="6140">Anyways, the point is - one of the points
of all this is this understanding of game</p>
<p t="3189120" d="6160">like structure is really really really really
really really deep inside of us, and it’s</p>
<p t="3195280" d="2529">way before articulation.</p>
<p t="3197809" d="3770">It’s way before we can say the rules.</p>
<p t="3201579" d="5260">Babies can pick up the damn rules right away
and it’s kind of a dance in some sense,</p>
<p t="3206839" d="2891">and a dance is also a rule bound structure.</p>
<p t="3209730" d="4471">If you’re dancing with someone well, there’s
rules, but don&#39;t step on their feet but you</p>
<p t="3214201" d="5119">also set up a set of expectations in the dance
and you violate them in tandem.</p>
<p t="3219320" d="2820">And if you can do it gracefully, it’s fun.</p>
<p t="3222140" d="4680">Maybe the person you’re dancing with is
an absolute klutz and so autistic you can’t</p>
<p t="3226820" d="4269">even get outside of yourself, and might make
a half reasonable partner or if it’s just</p>
<p t="3231089" d="1681">hopeless.</p>
<p t="3232770" d="1380">But the dance is the same thing.</p>
<p t="3234150" d="1760">It’s not negotiated verbally.</p>
<p t="3235910" d="5929">It’s negotiated bodily, and unless we’re
able to imitate, and imitate insanely well</p>
<p t="3241839" d="4131">because human beings can imitate like mad,
because we won’t be able to do that.</p>
<p t="3245970" d="1580">So babies are the same way.</p>
<p t="3247550" d="2880">You basically start - you don’t actually.</p>
<p t="3250430" d="6640">Peek-a-boo doesn’t have rules because a
rule is a stated description of a set of expectations.</p>
<p t="3257070" d="6749">What peek-a-boo has is expectations and repetition,
and you can violate the expectation but that</p>
<p t="3263819" d="5581">doesn’t mean you’re violating a rule because
an expectation is not a rule until you observe</p>
<p t="3269400" d="5090">the expectation, you describe what it is and
maybe even write it down.</p>
<p t="3274490" d="5920">You can play games long before you can follow
rules, and one of the things Piaget observed</p>
<p t="3280410" d="5940">is if you watched kids play a complicated
game like marbles and they&#39;re like six, and</p>
<p t="3286350" d="3380">you take them out of the game and ask them
what the rules are, they can&#39;t tell you or</p>
<p t="3289730" d="2950">they might get some of them right and a bunch
of them wrong.</p>
<p t="3292680" d="4350">Maybe if you interviewed every child that
was playing, and you looked at the commonality</p>
<p t="3297030" d="4289">of the descriptions, you could extract out
the underlying rule structure of the game.</p>
<p t="3301319" d="1841">But the kids don&#39;t know the rules.</p>
<p t="3303160" d="5260">What they know is how to play with other kids
when they&#39;re playing marbles, and a lot of</p>
<p t="3308420" d="5149">that’s nonverbal hints and eyebrow raises
and no you can’t do that and so forth.</p>
<p t="3313569" d="3250">It isn&#39;t much later until they can tell you
the rules, if ever.</p>
<p t="3316819" d="5961">So like, you know, you guys can&#39;t tell me
the rules for dancing successfully with someone.</p>
<p t="3322780" d="4789">You can tell me some stupid things you shouldn’t
do, but imagine how complex it is.</p>
<p t="3327569" d="4081">It’s very difficult to articulate out the
whole structure, but you can sure tell when</p>
<p t="3331650" d="4390">it’s happening, and you can sure tell when
you’re not doing it or when your partner</p>
<p t="3336040" d="1000">isn’t.</p>
<p t="3337040" d="4500">So partly what that also means is you know
how to do things you don&#39;t know how to do,</p>
<p t="3341540" d="4360">and you know how to all sorts of things you
don&#39;t know how you know how to do.</p>
<p t="3345900" d="2719">In fact, most of what you know is like that.</p>
<p t="3348619" d="7291">That also means we can be playing games that
are extraordinarily sophisticated that we</p>
<p t="3355910" d="4050">don’t understand, but that doesn&#39;t mean
- well we can&#39;t describe at least.</p>
<p t="3359960" d="5000">We don&#39;t have an articulated knowledge of
the structure, but we can still play them.</p>
<p t="3364960" d="2950">Now, I don&#39;t know if you know this or not.</p>
<p t="3367910" d="3780">You might know it.</p>
<p t="3371690" d="4600">A while back, twenty years ago - about that.</p>
<p t="3376290" d="7569">Those massive online multiplayer games started
to become popular, and some of them - I think,</p>
<p t="3383859" d="3421">although I don&#39;t know this for sure - some
of them lasted a long time, and maybe some</p>
<p t="3387280" d="2280">of them still being played, like the early
ones.</p>
<p t="3389560" d="6220">So they developed entire worlds in there and
you know, there was an economist who became</p>
<p t="3395780" d="2299">quite famous because of those games.</p>
<p t="3398079" d="2331">Castronova, I think his name was.</p>
<p t="3400410" d="1180">Edward Castronova.</p>
<p t="3401590" d="4040">I think that’s right, but it’s close.</p>
<p t="3405630" d="4530">Anyways, he thought hey look man those aren’t
games, those are countries.</p>
<p t="3410160" d="6139">So one of the things he tried to do was calculate
their gross national product, and you know,</p>
<p t="3416299" d="4441">you can trade items in those little worlds
and you could sell them on eBay.</p>
<p t="3420740" d="4829">For awhile in this one game, and maybe this
still happens, there were young people in</p>
<p t="3425569" d="4151">the Philippines who were working inside these
games making artifacts that they were selling</p>
<p t="3429720" d="4950">on eBay to other game players because they
could make more money doing that than actually</p>
<p t="3434670" d="3330">working in the actual world.</p>
<p t="3438000" d="4340">So Castronova - I think was his name - said
well you don&#39;t get it.</p>
<p t="3442340" d="1320">That is the real world.</p>
<p t="3443660" d="4550">It’s not a game, or if it’s a game it’s
so much like the world that it’s part of</p>
<p t="3448210" d="1000">the world.</p>
<p t="3449210" d="3770">So he calculated the gross national product
of some of these massive games, and they were</p>
<p t="3452980" d="2829">like the 30th richest country in the world.</p>
<p t="3455809" d="2131">It was insane.</p>
<p t="3457940" d="5780">So that’s interesting because that also
shows you that the line between a game and</p>
<p t="3463720" d="2420">reality is not clear.</p>
<p t="3466140" d="2510">Here’s another example of that.</p>
<p t="3468650" d="3199">Something worth thinking about.</p>
<p t="3471849" d="5322">Some of you have no doubt played very complex
multiplayer online games, and I suppose those</p>
<p t="3477171" d="3719">are often adventure games or quest games and
you have to communicate with other people</p>
<p t="3480890" d="5280">and you have to solve problems and maybe you
have to defend yourselves, like you&#39;re in</p>
<p t="3486170" d="2000">an exploratory party in a new world.</p>
<p t="3488170" d="1000">Something like that.</p>
<p t="3489170" d="5669">So it’s pretty sophisticated, and okay some
of you have worked at McDonald’s or another</p>
<p t="3494839" d="1000">fast food restaurant.</p>
<p t="3495839" d="2561">How many of you have worked at a restaurant.</p>
<p t="3498400" d="2230">How many at a fast food restaurant.</p>
<p t="3500630" d="6179">Would you say that an online game is more
like the world, or less like the world than</p>
<p t="3506809" d="2351">your job at a fast food restaurant.</p>
<p t="3509160" d="1000">More.</p>
<p t="3510160" d="1830">It’s more.</p>
<p t="3511990" d="1879">Anybody disagree?</p>
<p t="3513869" d="3031">Okay, why is it more like the real world?</p>
<p t="3516900" d="4210">Because you’re doing more complex stuff.</p>
<p t="3521110" d="1400">What are you doing?</p>
<p t="3522510" d="1000">You’re exploring.</p>
<p t="3523510" d="1000">You’re thinking.</p>
<p t="3524510" d="4610">You’re getting out of situations because
new ones are always coming up and you&#39;re dealing</p>
<p t="3529120" d="1749">with them and you’re learning.</p>
<p t="3530869" d="4961">Fast food is like you&#39;re doing - Right, you’re
a real cog in a fast food machine.</p>
<p t="3535830" d="1890">Yeah, but it’s in the real world.</p>
<p t="3537720" d="1000">Is it a game?</p>
<p t="3538720" d="2599">You’re more like a machine in the fast food
part.</p>
<p t="3541319" d="8421">So does that mean McDonald’s is less real
than a multiplayer online game?</p>
<p t="3549740" d="4190">Well it’s a tough one, eh, because when
you’re trying to think about what real means,</p>
<p t="3553930" d="2850">is you might think maybe I phrased that wrongly.</p>
<p t="3556780" d="6809">Maybe I could say is McDonald’s a worse
model of the real world than a multiplayer</p>
<p t="3563589" d="1611">online game?</p>
<p t="3565200" d="3940">And it’s hard because it’s hard to say
McDonald’s isn’t part of the real world</p>
<p t="3569140" d="2719">so a priori, the claim is kind of absurd.</p>
<p t="3571859" d="3010">It’s like well, you’re in a building.</p>
<p t="3574869" d="1061">People actually come there.</p>
<p t="3575930" d="1119">They give you money.</p>
<p t="3577049" d="1411">It’s real.</p>
<p t="3578460" d="5330">But then, well you think about these complex
games and you’re practicing an extraordinarily</p>
<p t="3583790" d="4250">sophisticated form of social and intellectual
behavior and we actually don’t know what</p>
<p t="3588040" d="1030">that does to people.</p>
<p t="3589070" d="2910">Maybe it makes them extraordinarily sophisticated
and social.</p>
<p t="3591980" d="5700">I do think it helps with introverts quite
a lot because it’s harder for introverts</p>
<p t="3597680" d="3169">to become extremely socially fluid because
people wear them out.</p>
<p t="3600849" d="5091">A lot of introverts do a lot of heavy duty
socializing on the net, and in my experience</p>
<p t="3605940" d="7560">it’s been, all things considered, probably
a plus rather than a minus.</p>
<p t="3613500" d="6210">With regards to your use of computational
devices, one of the things I used to see my</p>
<p t="3619710" d="2770">kids doing is they would sit together in a
group.</p>
<p t="3622480" d="5100">They were teenagers, and there’d be a bunch
of friends that weren&#39;t there and while they</p>
<p t="3627580" d="3070">were interacting with all their friends who
were there, they were also interacting with</p>
<p t="3630650" d="1459">all their friends who weren’t there.</p>
<p t="3632109" d="3191">Is that a common thing for teenagers to do?</p>
<p t="3635300" d="2450">You’re texting your friends and so forth.</p>
<p t="3637750" d="2500">Is that reasonably standard behavior?</p>
<p t="3640250" d="2010">How many of you have done that?</p>
<p t="3642260" d="2510">Okay how many of you have done that regularly?</p>
<p t="3644770" d="2190">Okay, how many of you haven’t done that?</p>
<p t="3646960" d="3409">Okay, so most people have done it but not
everyone.</p>
<p t="3650369" d="5191">For those of you have done it, is that more
advanced or less advanced social behavior?</p>
<p t="3655560" d="1090">More.</p>
<p t="3656650" d="1030">Okay you think more.</p>
<p t="3657680" d="1000">Why?</p>
<p t="3658680" d="3010">Cause you’re keeping your friends in the
room while they’re not there.</p>
<p t="3661690" d="2580">So it’s like they have a conceptual idea
of what you’re doing and it’s like - they</p>
<p t="3664270" d="11710">understand where the group dynamics are moving
towards without them actually having be there.</p>
<p t="3675980" d="6550">Okay, do you think that you paid a price for
it in the decrease of the interactions you</p>
<p t="3682530" d="2589">were having with the people that were actually
there?</p>
<p t="3685119" d="1000">Not really.Yes.</p>
<p t="3686119" d="1000">You think so.</p>
<p t="3687119" d="3701">Okay, how many people think they do pay a
price for it?</p>
<p t="3690820" d="2600">How many people think they didn’t?</p>
<p t="3693420" d="5590">Okay, so - well let’s start with you guys
then.</p>
<p t="3699010" d="1970">Why did you think you didn&#39;t pay a price for
it?</p>
<p t="3700980" d="1000">Well because I feel like it really doesn&#39;t
take that much time to just text and go back</p>
<p t="3701980" d="1000">to talk to your friends.</p>
<p t="3702980" d="1000">Okay.</p>
<p t="3703980" d="3750">Well I think that you can pay a price, but
if you’re doing it correctly and you’re</p>
<p t="3707730" d="11660">monitoring the conversation you&#39;re taking
a part of, you can see when it would be appropriate</p>
<p t="3719390" d="8679">to text someone else which probably means
you&#39;re paying more attention to the people</p>
<p t="3728069" d="3730">you&#39;re talking with because you&#39;re also texting.</p>
<p t="3731799" d="6401">Okay so you’re kind of taking a multitasking
rationale for it in some sense, although assuming</p>
<p t="3738200" d="2419">you have to also heighten your attention to
manage that.</p>
<p t="3740619" d="3621">There’s people who didn&#39;t think - that you
did pay a price for it.</p>
<p t="3744240" d="1280">Who thought that?</p>
<p t="3745520" d="1410">Okay, what sort of price?</p>
<p t="3746930" d="4830">I think that especially when you&#39;re texting
people, there&#39;s so much complexity that gets</p>
<p t="3751760" d="4820">lost in translation, like you don&#39;t really
convey your feelings, like there&#39;s so much</p>
<p t="3756580" d="1730">more to use than language.</p>
<p t="3758310" d="1490">Okay then they certainly lose something.</p>
<p t="3759800" d="7249">What about you, while you&#39;re interacting with
your actual present friends?</p>
<p t="3767049" d="15841">I would say you have to commit some certain
amount of effort to writing a text, you ignore</p>
<p t="3782890" d="1100">aspects of - for example, they’re asking
about something and then you go and text the</p>
<p t="3783990" d="3280">person and you come back and miss some part
of the conversation.</p>
<p t="3787270" d="1000">Yeah, so it’s like kind of -
Yeah so it’s kind of like start, stop, start,</p>
<p t="3788270" d="1000">stop.</p>
<p t="3789270" d="1000">I don&#39;t think you can one hundred percent
commit yourself to -</p>
<p t="3790270" d="1100">Well one of the things you suggested was that
some of that can be mitigated by doing it</p>
<p t="3791370" d="6570">properly, which implies there&#39;s an emergent
norm for doing this sort of thing and that</p>
<p t="3797940" d="4800">if you&#39;re good at complying with the norm,
then you’re not irritating people and maybe</p>
<p t="3802740" d="1470">you can handle both things at once.</p>
<p t="3804210" d="1000">Something like that.</p>
<p t="3805210" d="5260">But if it’s properly to the people who are
there, is it proper for the friend who is</p>
<p t="3810470" d="1620">waiting for you to answer?</p>
<p t="3812090" d="4180">Well I guess one answer to that is that’s
up to them to determine, like if they don&#39;t</p>
<p t="3816270" d="2920">want to be part of it, they can do something
else.</p>
<p t="3819190" d="3700">The reason I’m saying that specifically
is that you can imagine that’s how the norm</p>
<p t="3822890" d="1000">develops.</p>
<p t="3823890" d="6280">It’s like obviously if a successful norm
is going to develop that allows text conversation</p>
<p t="3830170" d="6119">and real world conversation to occur at the
same time, everybody has to want it to happen.</p>
<p t="3836289" d="5041">That means if you can’t do it in the manner
that everyone wants, it’s going to die out.</p>
<p t="3841330" d="8039">Now see, that&#39;s another example of how you
can see how moral structures - I think - might</p>
<p t="3849369" d="4191">evolve, is the right way of thinking about
it because I think moral structures evolve.</p>
<p t="3853560" d="3680">And I think they’re just as real as anything
else that evolves.</p>
<p t="3857240" d="3450">Now, evolved things can be staggeringly complex.</p>
<p t="3860690" d="4659">Just think about how many lifeforms there
are, and how many niches there are for their</p>
<p t="3865349" d="4871">lifeforms and so you have in some sense an
infinite variety, but it’s not infinite,</p>
<p t="3870220" d="2069">and it follows patterns.</p>
<p t="3872289" d="4211">Not just any old thing can be alive, and not
just any old thing can be social.</p>
<p t="3876500" d="6130">Here’s an example, and I found this out
awhile back.</p>
<p t="3882630" d="6290">I did a lot of neurobiological research.</p>
<p t="3888920" d="6110">Some of it hands on, a lot of it conceptual
especially in the early days of my graduate</p>
<p t="3895030" d="1000">work.</p>
<p t="3896030" d="2960">I got really interested in the function of
serotonin.</p>
<p t="3898990" d="4520">You all know, undoubtedly, that one of the
things antidepressants do is decrease the</p>
<p t="3903510" d="3441">rate at which serotonin is pulled back up
into the neurons that deliver it and that</p>
<p t="3906951" d="2839">seems to help stabilize people’s negative
emotions.</p>
<p t="3909790" d="4630">Makes them less volatile, less anxious, less
likely to withdraw, and so - or you could</p>
<p t="3914420" d="2590">say it makes them more confident.</p>
<p t="3917010" d="7099">Now we also know if you say we look at a chimp
hierarchy, you take bottom chimp and you give</p>
<p t="3924109" d="4211">him anti-depressants, he looks a lot more
like top chimp.</p>
<p t="3928320" d="3840">So, because the bottom chimp world is a very
dangerous place.</p>
<p t="3932160" d="1000">It’s very uncertain.</p>
<p t="3933160" d="1800">He doesn&#39;t have a place to sleep.</p>
<p t="3934960" d="1760">He doesn&#39;t have high quality mates.</p>
<p t="3936720" d="1350">He doesn&#39;t have good things to eat.</p>
<p t="3938070" d="2330">He’s stressed man, it’s bad down there.</p>
<p t="3940400" d="3800">So maybe that&#39;s part of the reason his nervous
system is tuned so that he’s more anxious</p>
<p t="3944200" d="3780">and upset by everything because everything
is more dangerous.</p>
<p t="3947980" d="1730">Part of that’s modulated by serotonin.</p>
<p t="3949710" d="2270">Okay, so here’s a rough rule.</p>
<p t="3951980" d="7450">If there’s a hierarchy in an animal kingdom,
as you move up the hierarchy, your serotonin</p>
<p t="3959430" d="4649">levels increase and as you move down the hierarchy,
your serotonin levels decrease and that’s</p>
<p t="3964079" d="4260">somewhat independent of your absolute wealth.</p>
<p t="3968339" d="1041">So here’s a famous experiment.</p>
<p t="3969380" d="4209">It’s called the White Hall experiment and
it was done on English bureaucrats, and the</p>
<p t="3973589" d="3451">thing that’s so cool about the White Hall
experiments is they were done fifty years</p>
<p t="3977040" d="1000">apart.</p>
<p t="3978040" d="5240">So what they showed basically was - imagine
you take an English bureaucracy and you stratify</p>
<p t="3983280" d="1490">it by position.</p>
<p t="3984770" d="4540">Englishmen are hierarchical, and so you stratify
it by position.</p>
<p t="3989310" d="5800">You have the top people and the bottom people
and what you find is the bottom people die</p>
<p t="3995110" d="2330">faster and more often.</p>
<p t="3997440" d="3960">You might say if you&#39;re not that healthy,
you end up at the bottom.</p>
<p t="4001400" d="5090">Fair enough, but there seems to be an effect
above the effect of just general health.</p>
<p t="4006490" d="3030">It’s worse to be at the bottom than at the
top.</p>
<p t="4009520" d="6370">Okay, that was true 70 years ago, and another
study was done 50 years after that.</p>
<p t="4015890" d="5590">Now the thing that’s so cool is by that
time, from a material perspective, the people</p>
<p t="4021480" d="5500">at the bottom of the modern hierarchy were
at least as wealthy as the people who were</p>
<p t="4026980" d="9250">like two thirds of the way up 50 years before
because everybody had running water, everyone</p>
<p t="4036230" d="2430">had enough heat for the winter, you know.</p>
<p t="4038660" d="1540">Everyone had shelter, and so on.</p>
<p t="4040200" d="7330">So you figure, with regards to wealth, once
you’ve got running water, reliable shelter,</p>
<p t="4047530" d="5990">heat, and maybe air conditioning if you live
in the desert, and you’re not hungry, you’ve</p>
<p t="4053520" d="2559">got ninety percent of what wealth can deliver.</p>
<p t="4056079" d="1831">Really, all things considered.</p>
<p t="4057910" d="8419">The rest of it is just status and luxury items,
but the relationship between position of status</p>
<p t="4066329" d="4171">and death rates remain constant.</p>
<p t="4070500" d="4210">So that’s very interesting, and we know
that that’s true from a lot of other studies</p>
<p t="4074710" d="1000">as well.</p>
<p t="4075710" d="4740">It’s like control for absolute wealth, there’s
still problems with hierarchy, and that seems</p>
<p t="4080450" d="4570">mediated at least in part by serotonin, and
serotonin regulates negative emotion, and</p>
<p t="4085020" d="3799">the more negative emotion that you experience,
the more cortisol you produce, and cortisol</p>
<p t="4088819" d="4821">in high levels is toxic and suppresses your
immune system so your brain gets damaged,</p>
<p t="4093640" d="3669">and you gain weight and you get diabetes,
and maybe develop Alzheimer’s disease and</p>
<p t="4097309" d="4821">are maybe more prone to cancer and heart disease,
and that’s just not good.</p>
<p t="4102130" d="10649">Now that serotonergic mechanism is really
old, and so you can give serotonin injections</p>
<p t="4112779" d="4210">to unhappy lobsters and it cheers them right
up, at least behaviorally speaking.</p>
<p t="4116989" d="3922">If they&#39;re defeated in a fight, and you give
them a serotonin injection, they’ll stand</p>
<p t="4120911" d="2799">up tall, confident and they’ll fight again.</p>
<p t="4123710" d="4629">I’m telling you that for a very specific
reason.</p>
<p t="4128339" d="4770">One of the things we’ve been asking about
is well how might you conceptualize moral</p>
<p t="4133109" d="2771">systems and how might you conceptualize evolution?</p>
<p t="4135880" d="7770">One of the propositions was there are playable
games and non-playable games.</p>
<p t="4143650" d="1620">Well here’s a playable game.</p>
<p t="4145270" d="1250">Dominance hierarchy.</p>
<p t="4146520" d="4060">We’ve been playing it for four hundred million
years.</p>
<p t="4150580" d="1710">It’s stable.</p>
<p t="4152290" d="6840">Now, it’s so stable that even lobsters have
them, but even worse is that the biochemical</p>
<p t="4159130" d="9200">systems the lobsters use act within the dominance
hierarchy and react to, it’s the same in</p>
<p t="4168330" d="1060">us.</p>
<p t="4169390" d="6969">And so, not only is that stable, it’s well
ridiculously stable.</p>
<p t="4176359" d="7261">So one of the things we could say is that
one of the games that seems emergent and real</p>
<p t="4183620" d="1230">is a dominance hierarchy.</p>
<p t="4184850" d="5130">And then we might ask what exactly constitutes
a dominance hierarchy, and we might ask well</p>
<p t="4189980" d="5429">what constitutes a highly functional hierarchy
versus a dysfunctional hierarchy, and even</p>
<p t="4195409" d="3471">what does highly functional and dysfunctional
mean.</p>
<p t="4198880" d="2190">Well we have to define all those terms.</p>
<p t="4201070" d="1770">We will, as we move forward.</p>
<p t="4202840" d="5720">But the point I’m making is - and this is
a bit of a contradiction with the initial</p>
<p t="4208560" d="6080">system I made with the tight distinction between
the scientific world and the objective world</p>
<p t="4214640" d="6870">because I’m also talking about the evolution
of games, and you know, the study of evolution</p>
<p t="4221510" d="6520">is a scientific study and the dominance hierarchy
is a biological phenomena and so in some sense</p>
<p t="4228030" d="4010">it’s also a game, and it’s also a moral
structure and so there are levels of analysis</p>
<p t="4232040" d="3500">where these things start to get tangled together,
and that’s partly what we’ll try to sort</p>
<p t="4235540" d="1500">out.</p>
<p t="4237040" d="5949">So, we’ll do that in the future because
it’s very very complicated.</p>
<p t="4242989" d="10601">Alright now we’re gonna step back a little
bit.</p>
