<p t="34160" d="4080">There’s this piece from search for the Holy
Grail. And the Holy Grail is a myth that was</p>
<p t="38390" d="2910">constructed in England. And-And the myth goes
something like this:</p>
<p t="41300" d="5789">There is a-- There is a cup, the Grail, used
to hold Christ’s blood. And that cup has</p>
<p t="47089" d="3921">a-- has redemptive significance and it’s
been lost.</p>
<p t="51010" d="3189">And the knights – King Arthur’s knights
– who go off to look for the Holy Grail</p>
<p t="54199" d="2660">are after this cup. So, it’s a redemption
story, right?</p>
<p t="56859" d="6991">It means, the world’s damned, unredeemed.
There’s some object that can serve as, as</p>
<p t="63850" d="4480">the source of redemption – the source of
nourishment, say, thinking about it from a</p>
<p t="68330" d="4220">symbolic perspective – and it’s worthwhile
to go on a quest of that sort.</p>
<p t="72550" d="3600">And the King Arthur story is set up in an
interesting way, ‘cause there’s a king,</p>
<p t="76150" d="4710">Arthur, but he has all these knights, these
nobles, and they all sit at a round table.</p>
<p t="80860" d="4210">And they’re at a round table because they’re
equals. So, although it’s a hierarchical</p>
<p t="85070" d="3830">story, there’s-there’s a motif in it that
transcends the hierarchy.</p>
<p t="88900" d="6580">It says: Well… yeah, under normal circumstances
everyone’s arranged in a hierarchy. But</p>
<p t="95480" d="4150">when you’re out to seek whatever you need,
then everyone’s an equal. And so, fine,</p>
<p t="99630" d="3610">so they sit at the round table, and then they
go off to search for the Holy Grail</p>
<p t="103240" d="4630">And the story opens with a very interesting
motif, which is the knights look at the forest</p>
<p t="107870" d="5230">and then they try to find the part that looks
the darkest, to them. And then, they go that</p>
<p t="113100" d="4900">way. That’s the marker for their mission,
right, to go to the darkest place. And of</p>
<p t="118000" d="3610">course, each knight goes off in a different
direction because the world looks slightly</p>
<p t="121610" d="4880">different to each knight.
So… objectively speaking, they’re going</p>
<p t="126490" d="3610">to a different place. But psychologically
speaking, they are going to the same place,</p>
<p t="130100" d="3930">right? And that place, I suppose, is being
represented in mythology and literature as</p>
<p t="134030" d="3690">“The Heart of Darkness”.
And if you were ever curious about why people</p>
<p t="137720" d="5570">aren’t enlightened – since it seems to
be a possibility – you can always think</p>
<p t="143290" d="4460">about the story of King Arthur and the knights
of the Holy Grail, and think: Well, do you</p>
<p t="147750" d="4280">really want to enter the forest at the darkest
place? And the answer to that is of course:</p>
<p t="152030" d="5250">No, because the darkest place means precisely
that place you least want to go. And it’s</p>
<p t="157280" d="7000">the same for everyone
So then, I have this little nephew, although</p>
<p t="165230" d="5150">he’s almost 15 now. He had this dream when
he was four years old. And the background</p>
<p t="170380" d="4950">to the dream is this: He was waking up in
the middle of the night for months, screaming.</p>
<p t="175330" d="5970">He had night terrors. And this went on for
like six months. And what was happening in</p>
<p t="181300" d="4210">his life was twofold: There was some instability
in his family, ‘cause his parents got divorced</p>
<p t="185510" d="4620">about a year after that. And also, he was
at the transition point from staying at home</p>
<p t="190130" d="3300">to going to kindergarten.
So, you know, not only was he making the big</p>
<p t="193430" d="4889">move out there into the terrible world, but
the stable point from which he might like</p>
<p t="198319" d="4611">to have moved was shaky. So, you know, he
wasn’t having that great a time.</p>
<p t="202930" d="4310">so anyways he’s screaming away at night,
and this is pretty unsettling, right, ‘cause</p>
<p t="207240" d="3530">night terrors are no joke, and so he’s upset
about it, and his mom’s upset about it,</p>
<p t="210770" d="3140">and so I’m watching him and he’s running
around the house; he’s only about this high,</p>
<p t="213910" d="4900">a very verbal kid, and he’s got this knight
hat on, and this sword and this shield, and</p>
<p t="218810" d="4320">he’s running around the house being a knight,
and at night he takes his night hat and his</p>
<p t="223130" d="2750">shield and his sword to bed,
and I think, we’ll that’s pretty cool,</p>
<p t="225880" d="4829">and you can see how that makes sense, right,
and you can see how it’s an enacted reality</p>
<p t="230709" d="5311">‘cause children enact or act out their reality
before they can explicitly understand it,</p>
<p t="236020" d="6740">just like we do, and so I’m staying there,
he wakes up, and he has, you know, one of</p>
<p t="242760" d="3890">these fits, and then the next morning he comes
to breakfast, and I said, hey, did you have</p>
<p t="246650" d="5260">any dreams last night, and he goes, yeah,
I had a dream; I said, well, tell us the dream,</p>
<p t="251910" d="2370">and there’s six adults sitting around the
table and, you know, we’re ready for this</p>
<p t="254280" d="5509">dream, or so we think, and then he says, okay,
I was out in this field and I was surrounded</p>
<p t="259789" d="5801">by beaked dwarfs, and they came up to my knees,
and so these dwarfs they had no arms, they</p>
<p t="265590" d="3750">just had shoulders, and powerful legs, and
they had, they were all covered with hair,</p>
<p t="269340" d="2859">and they had a cross shaved on the top of
their head, and they were all covered with</p>
<p t="272199" d="5000">grease, and everywhere I went these dwarfs
would jump up with their beaks and bite me,</p>
<p t="277199" d="5580">and you’re looking at him like, that accounts
for the night terrors, right,</p>
<p t="282779" d="4491">and so then he says, yeah, and there’s more
to it too; if, if you look in the background</p>
<p t="287270" d="4970">behind all the dwarfs there was a dragon way
in the background and it was puffing out fire</p>
<p t="292240" d="4130">and smoke, and every time it puffed out fire
and smoke, a whole bunch more of these dwarfs</p>
<p t="296370" d="5269">would get made, and you think, that’s pretty
cool, that’s a hydra story, right, remember</p>
<p t="301639" d="5030">the story of the hydra, cut off one head,
two more grows, it’s one of Hercules’</p>
<p t="306669" d="5110">trials, and that’s an observation about
the world, which is, you solve one problem,</p>
<p t="311779" d="2920">and like two more problems pop up, and then
you solve those and…</p>
<p t="314699" d="3930">Anyways, he says, okay, well I’ve got this
dragon back there, and so this is his problem,</p>
<p t="318629" d="3970">right, he’s been eaten by beaked dwarfs,
and that’s not good, and there’s not much</p>
<p t="322599" d="3500">sense fighting them off because there’s
just more of them made every time this thing</p>
<p t="326099" d="4040">lurking in the background breathes, so I said,
what could you do about that</p>
<p t="330139" d="4750">it’s like his brain was working all these
ideas around and he’d heard lots of Disney</p>
<p t="334889" d="4571">stories and had lots of books read to him,
and had abstracted out a lot of information,</p>
<p t="339460" d="3349">but he hadn’t quite got it right, and it
was all seething around in his head, and I</p>
<p t="342809" d="4440">just said, well, what could you do, tap, and
he went, oh I know what I could do.</p>
<p t="347249" d="4831">I could take my sword and I’d get my dad,
which is a good notion, right, ‘cause he’s</p>
<p t="352080" d="3910">small, and then I’d jump up on the dragon
and I’d pop out both of its eyes with the</p>
<p t="355990" d="4899">sword so it couldn’t see me, and then I’d
go down its throat to the box where the fire</p>
<p t="360889" d="4530">came out, and then I’d carve a piece out
of the box and I’d use that as a shield,</p>
<p t="365419" d="4890">and I thought, great, you really got the story,
and the story’s something like this,</p>
<p t="370309" d="5140">right: If you’re being plagued by midget
dwarfs and you wipe them out and they keep</p>
<p t="375449" d="3201">multiplying, well you’re obviously aiming
at the wrong target, right, you should be</p>
<p t="378650" d="4579">going to their source, so he went after the
dragon, but not only after the dragon, he</p>
<p t="383229" d="3640">went right down the throat of the dragon,
which is, you know, a fairly brave thing to</p>
<p t="386869" d="4330">do, and then right to the place where the
fire, the transforming element, was being</p>
<p t="391199" d="4800">produced, and he took a piece of the device
that made the transforming element, and he</p>
<p t="395999" d="4401">used it as a shield.
Okay. Well that’s really cool, and the story’s</p>
<p t="400400" d="5259">better than that, I think, and it’s true
even, so it’s not one of those fake, he-was-dreaming-and-then-woke-up</p>
<p t="405659" d="3650">sort of stories; this actually happened; he
didn’t have any more nightmares,</p>
<p t="409309" d="3290">so when I checked with his mother, repeatedly
after that because I thought, well this is</p>
<p t="412599" d="4141">too good to be true, right, he’s got this
terrible night terror thing, he does one little</p>
<p t="416740" d="3220">mythological dream thing, and, bang, he’s,
he’s better,</p>
<p t="419960" d="2750">but that’s the case, it is the case, he
didn’t have any more nightmares after that,</p>
<p t="422710" d="4090">and I think that’s because he’d almost
already got it, right; he was running around</p>
<p t="426800" d="6089">like a knight; he knew, almost, it just had
to be made a little more explicit, and not</p>
<p t="432889" d="5150">even that explicit ‘cause it was still a
story. he didn’t know you should go to the</p>
<p t="438039" d="3990">source of your anxieties, right, to the thing
that plagues you the most, and you should</p>
<p t="442029" d="4510">explore that in detail until you find the
information that it contains that will protect</p>
<p t="446539" d="2850">you against it.
He couldn’t say that, but he could tell</p>
<p t="449389" d="5631">the story, and he could act it out, and that
looked like it was good enough, so that’s</p>
<p t="455020" d="7000">pretty cool, so he basically, you know, he
managed this, essentially, he fought the dragon</p>
<p t="462020" d="7000">of chaos, popped back up, as what, as he who
can obtain victory over the dragon of chaos,</p>
<p t="469379" d="6111">and that’s a pretty good story because it
says, well, if your frame of reference gets</p>
<p t="475490" d="6399">blown away by something you don’t understand,
some new challenge, and you face the challenge,</p>
<p t="481889" d="4370">at least courageously and, and humbly, which
means, you know, you’re not gonna run away,</p>
<p t="486259" d="4050">and you still have something to learn, then
you can extract something out of the battle</p>
<p t="490309" d="7000">that will enable you to withstand it.
and you think, well why should I believe that,</p>
<p t="499439" d="4021">right, and the answer to that would be, well,
don’t knock it till you try it, and the</p>
<p t="503460" d="4299">second answer would be, that’s exactly what
we do in clinical psychotherapy all the time,</p>
<p t="507759" d="3870">and there’s endless amounts, I think, of
empirical evidence saying that, you bring</p>
<p t="511629" d="3890">someone in, they’ve got an anxiety disorder,
maybe they’re even depressed, whatever,</p>
<p t="515519" d="3800">they’re running away. You say, you actually
don’t have to run away;</p>
<p t="519319" d="3611">here’s what you have to do: you have to
break the problem down into little pieces,</p>
<p t="522930" d="4579">digestible pieces, and then you have to hit
it one by one, and what you’ll discover</p>
<p t="527509" d="5200">is, not that you habituate to the anxiety
because that’s a silly theory; instead what</p>
<p t="532709" d="3930">you discover is that you thought you were
the person who had to run away, but it turns</p>
<p t="536639" d="3250">out you’re not the person who has to run
away, you’re the person that can stand there</p>
<p t="539889" d="4841">while you’re anxious and learn something,
and what you most particularly learn is that</p>
<p t="544730" d="5010">you’re the person who can stand there when
they’re anxious and learn, and if you’ve</p>
<p t="549740" d="4980">learned that, you don’t have to be anxious
anymore, or even more importantly, if you’re</p>
<p t="554720" d="3239">anxious, it doesn’t matter, it doesn’t
mean your life’s over, it just means that</p>
<p t="557959" d="4201">there you are on the threshold, right, between
what you know and what you don’t know, and</p>
<p t="562160" d="2590">you have something to learn, and you can learn
it,</p>
<p t="564750" d="3790">and I think that’s what the empirical evidence
suggests too because you got Edna Foa’s</p>
<p t="568540" d="4669">work with post-traumatic stress disorder victims,
primarily women who were violently raped,</p>
<p t="573209" d="5320">and Foa says, well I know you don’t like
to think about the event, and it’s no bloody</p>
<p t="578529" d="3661">wonder, look what it did to you, and how terrible
it was, but if you re-live it over and over</p>
<p t="582190" d="4639">and over again in your imagination, in as
much detail as possible, including all the</p>
<p t="586829" d="4341">motivational and emotional details, which
she measures psycho-physiologically, you will</p>
<p t="591170" d="3969">get better faster and you will stay better
longer, and her work’s well documented,</p>
<p t="595139" d="5320">and then there’s endless cases of exposure
in psychotherapy, you can certainly eliminate</p>
<p t="600459" d="5541">simple phobias within an hour, and even complex
phobias like agoraphobia, which is more like</p>
<p t="606000" d="4050">fear of everything. It’s not an intractable
disorder</p>
<p t="610050" d="6420">Imagine that throughout your whole life you
never turned away from a mistake, not even</p>
<p t="616470" d="5820">once, never. So that whenever you made a mistake
that you could rectify, you did rectify it.</p>
<p t="622290" d="4690">Then the question would be well, what, what
exactly would you be like? Would you be suffering</p>
<p t="626980" d="4349">from all your existential trouble? Would you
be vulnerable to anxiety? What would you be</p>
<p t="631329" d="2310">like?
And then I think well I only know a couple</p>
<p t="633639" d="3950">of stories like that. And the one that I told
you is the story of Solzhenitsyn. Because</p>
<p t="637589" d="5740">Solzhenitsyn, a Russian novelist sitting in
the concentration camps in the Gulag archipelago</p>
<p t="643329" d="7000">thinking, starving, this isn&#39;t so good. How
in the world did I get here? And the simple</p>
<p t="651079" d="4671">story is well Stalin put you there and he
was bad, right? End of story. It&#39;s not your</p>
<p t="655750" d="6160">problem. Stalin&#39;s problem. But Solzhenitsyn
said well, that doesn&#39;t really leave me anything</p>
<p t="661910" d="5479">to do right, to construe myself as a simple
victim of fate? And I do have a lot of time</p>
<p t="667389" d="4700">on my hands since I&#39;m not really doing anything
that requires a tremendous amount of intellectual</p>
<p t="672089" d="5670">effort. Let&#39;s try a game. Let&#39;s do this. Let&#39;s
pretend that the reason that things happen</p>
<p t="677759" d="5500">to me that I don&#39;t like even terrible things
say, or that I can&#39;t tolerate, is not because</p>
<p t="683259" d="6320">I&#39;m a victim of fate, evil cruel fate, but
because there’s something I didn&#39;t do.</p>
<p t="689579" d="6231">And so Solzhenitsyn said well, I&#39;m gonna go
back over my whole life, right? Step by step,</p>
<p t="695810" d="5670">detail by detail. And I’m gonna try to remember
every time I let something go or I didn&#39;t</p>
<p t="701480" d="4870">do something I was supposed to. Not because
of some adherence to some you know, arbitrary</p>
<p t="706350" d="5130">moral code, cause we don&#39;t believe in those
anyways, right? But just because I noted that</p>
<p t="711480" d="4060">I can tell when I owe a debt to existence,
right?</p>
<p t="715540" d="3710">So then you look at Solzhenitsyn and he says
okay, well so I spent fifteen years trying</p>
<p t="719250" d="5699">to untie all the knots that I tied up in my
brain. And the consequence was, of that was</p>
<p t="724949" d="3541">first I started to notice there are some people
out there I really admired, man. They were</p>
<p t="728490" d="3370">so tough it was unbelievable. You put them
in the worst circumstances and they didn&#39;t</p>
<p t="731860" d="5219">bend an inch. They were tough. And even the
nastiest prison guards in the... well, they</p>
<p t="737079" d="3070">could kill them, that&#39;s for sure. But they
couldn&#39;t bend them. And they couldn&#39;t break</p>
<p t="740149" d="3781">them. And I really learned something from
that, right? And it&#39;s a good story. Because</p>
<p t="743930" d="4079">he&#39;s in the worst possible circumstance. So
there&#39;s kind of no bottom past that. You don&#39;t</p>
<p t="748009" d="4031">get much worse than the Gulag prison camp,
right? That’s, it’s cold. You don&#39;t get</p>
<p t="752040" d="4210">anything to eat and you’re being worked
to death, right? For something pointless.</p>
<p t="756250" d="4860">And to serve Stalin. That&#39;s, that&#39;s the bottom.
And he said even under those circumstances</p>
<p t="761110" d="4899">there were still people who could, who could
thrive, who could manifest admirable qualities.</p>
<p t="766009" d="5080">He said once I figured out I was wrong, I
could actually find them and learn from them.</p>
<p t="771089" d="3440">Then he wrote this book, which you know about,
the Gulag Archipelago, which was released</p>
<p t="774529" d="6430">in the west and then circulated all through
the Soviet Union. And was undoubtedly one</p>
<p t="780959" d="5041">of the factors that contributed to the demise
of the Soviet Union. And so then you think</p>
<p t="786000" d="7000">well that&#39;s pretty interesting, isn&#39;t it?
You got this one wacko, right? Russian prisoner,</p>
<p t="793370" d="4199">starving to death. Tattooed. He says maybe
I had something to do with this. But he didn&#39;t</p>
<p t="797569" d="4351">mean it in some casual sort of, maybe I had
something to do with this way. He meant geez,</p>
<p t="801920" d="4479">this is really awful. Doesn&#39;t get much worse.
Maybe it&#39;s my fault. You know, I don&#39;t know</p>
<p t="806399" d="4961">how it could be. But it, after all I&#39;m the
one that&#39;s suffering. So, maybe it was me.</p>
<p t="811360" d="2510">Maybe I could fix it. What would happen if
I did?</p>
<p t="813870" d="4699">And so his conclusion was at the end. And
it&#39;s not a conclusion that he reached alone,</p>
<p t="818569" d="5580">was one person who stops lying can bring down
a tyranny. And you think that’s a metaphorical</p>
<p t="824149" d="3911">statement, right? Because you&#39;re the victim
of your own tyrannies, just as you are the</p>
<p t="828060" d="6060">victim of someone else&#39;s tyrannies. And maybe
if you stop lying, construed in this manner</p>
<p t="834120" d="5639">of sin of omission, right? Don&#39;t avoid anomalies
anymore. But confront them head on. Maybe</p>
<p t="839759" d="5151">if you quit lying, well then you wouldn&#39;t
be victim of tyranny. Maybe no one else would</p>
<p t="844910" d="7000">be either.
The G.R.E. say, the bad exam, that’s a bad</p>
<p t="854730" d="3959">thing, but it’s not the worst thing;
the worst thing is the sort of thing that</p>
<p t="858689" d="6310">knocks existentialists for a loop, right,
the worst thing is more like Ivan Karamazov’s</p>
<p t="864999" d="3590">suffering of innocent children, right, the
fact that children are tortured, or the worst</p>
<p t="868589" d="5410">thing is the fact that perfectly good people
get sick and die, and sometimes painfully,</p>
<p t="873999" d="4041">or the worst thing is there are tyrants all
over the world and they torture people for</p>
<p t="878040" d="4510">no cause or maybe even just because they like
torturing people, and that’s an anomaly</p>
<p t="882550" d="2889">of a different order, right,
it’s not just that you’re going from Point</p>
<p t="885439" d="4041">A to B and something you don’t like happens,
it’s more like thee are some aspects of</p>
<p t="889480" d="5269">existence that look so terrible in and of
themselves associated with our vulnerability</p>
<p t="894749" d="5530">that just apprehending them might be enough
to knock the bottom out of your faith in any</p>
<p t="900279" d="3170">frame of reference,
and that’s a kind of Nietzschean theme,</p>
<p t="903449" d="5031">Nietzsche says: look, when you’re going
from Point A to B and something bad happens,</p>
<p t="908480" d="3450">something you don’t expect, you don’t
get to where you wanted to go, that’s bad,</p>
<p t="911930" d="4230">but what’s even worse is, you can’t have
any faith in the frame of reference that you</p>
<p t="916160" d="4570">were using, ‘cause it’s been invalidated,
but what’s even worst is, you plow your</p>
<p t="920730" d="4599">way through two or three frames of reference,
and then you start to develop some skepticism</p>
<p t="925329" d="5740">about frames of reference in general, right.
so I was a socialist, say, and then I was</p>
<p t="931069" d="4430">a Catholic, and, you know then I developed
some new age philosophy, and none of those</p>
<p t="935499" d="5190">really worked, and what that made me think
was, well you can’t trust socialism, you</p>
<p t="940689" d="4471">can’t trust Christianity, and those new
age people are certainly out to lunch, maybe</p>
<p t="945160" d="5070">you can’t trust any frames of reference,
and that’s a really devastating discovery,</p>
<p t="950230" d="4959">and Nietzsche associated that with the death
of God, right, it’s like, no frames of reference</p>
<p t="955189" d="3781">work, and then you have the problem that,
well, without a frame of reference life is</p>
<p t="958970" d="5859">chaos, and chaos is intolerable, and therefore
logically life is intolerable,</p>
<p t="964829" d="5281">and I tried to make a case for you then that’s
kind of a side case, which was, people protect</p>
<p t="970110" d="3750">their ideologies ‘cause they don’t want
to lose their frames of reference, they don’t</p>
<p t="973860" d="6519">want to fall into chaos, but then there’s
this additional problem, which is that you</p>
<p t="980379" d="6231">can develop a kind of deep cynicism about
life in a secondary manner, which is like</p>
<p t="986610" d="5510">constant loss of faith.
maybe what you conclude under those conditions,</p>
<p t="992120" d="7000">like the aggressive child concludes, is that,
fundamentally, I’m not to be trusted, you’re</p>
<p t="999230" d="4700">not to be trusted, society is not to be trusted,
and maybe the structure of the world as a</p>
<p t="1003930" d="7000">whole isn’t to be trusted, and, therefore,
logically, you’re more or less obligated</p>
<p t="1011740" d="5339">to work against it,
and so then you have a nice sub-story for</p>
<p t="1017079" d="6450">the propagation of evil, which is, well, we
like to have our ideological frames of reference</p>
<p t="1023529" d="4251">retained, and that gives us ample reason to
squash anyone that’s different, but then</p>
<p t="1027780" d="4040">there’s this additional reason, which is,
when you get right down to it, things are</p>
<p t="1031820" d="5050">pretty, bloody awful, and maybe the sensible
thing to do is to just work for the in annihilation</p>
<p t="1036870" d="4170">of things, and I think we’ve had endless
examples of people who did precisely that</p>
<p t="1041040" d="2360">in the 20th Century and almost got away with
it,</p>
<p t="1043400" d="7000">in case you’re tempted not to take this
sufficiently seriously, right, we know that</p>
<p t="1050420" d="6000">Stalin, in all likelihood,, who I think you
could make a case for being if not the most</p>
<p t="1056420" d="4080">evil man that ever lived, certainly the most
evil man that lived this century, and that’s</p>
<p t="1060500" d="3740">really a high honor, right, ‘cause he was
up against some really top contenders.</p>
<p t="1064240" d="5520">We know, as a consequence of recently-released
KGB documents, that he was probably gearing</p>
<p t="1069760" d="4540">up to start the Third World War, and not one
of these little half-rate, you know, little</p>
<p t="1074300" d="5270">local Third World Wars, we are talking about
the whole H bomb exchange thing designed to</p>
<p t="1079570" d="4020">eradicate, you know, the U.S. for sure, but
also the Soviet Union,</p>
<p t="1083590" d="4750">and, well, mere territoriality isn’t enough
to account for that, but then maybe you can</p>
<p t="1088340" d="4330">see Stalin’s point, right, like Tolstoy
can see it, you know, if life is really so</p>
<p t="1092670" d="5460">awful at bottom, which there are perspectives
from which that certainly seems to be the</p>
<p t="1098130" d="6200">case, then why bother having it around at
all.</p>
<p t="1104330" d="7000">Well, you know, that’s a pretty dismal perspective,
so that’s a real anomaly, right, that’s</p>
<p t="1114280" d="3420">not one of these little second-rate you’ll-get-over-it-in-a-month-or-two
anomalies,</p>
<p t="1117700" d="3950">this is the sort of anomaly that’s laid
out in Genesis, where Adam and Eve discover</p>
<p t="1121650" d="4680">that they’re mortal, vulnerable, they’re
gonna die, that really takes the shine off</p>
<p t="1126330" d="5160">existence out of paradise they go, they wander
around the planet for the rest of history,</p>
<p t="1131490" d="3590">you know, working themselves to death and
being miserable and killing each other, and</p>
<p t="1135080" d="3460">that’s basically the story that’s laid
out in the Old Testament, and viewed from</p>
<p t="1138540" d="5470">that perspective, well, it’s not precisely
an empirical description of the big bang say,</p>
<p t="1144010" d="4920">but it’s not a bad description of the nature
of human existence, and it’s pretty dismal</p>
<p t="1148930" d="7000">There’s an essential symbolic relationship
between the ingestion of food and its transformative</p>
<p t="1159110" d="5980">capacities and the, and the ingestion of ideas,
and their transformative capacity.</p>
<p t="1165090" d="4060">and what happens when Adam and Eve eat this
fruit, which they’re not supposed to eat,</p>
<p t="1169150" d="5870">is that they learn that they’re going to
die, and that screws up Paradise,</p>
<p t="1175020" d="4490">and in case you just think I’m making this
up, which would be, you know, kind of annoying,</p>
<p t="1179510" d="4570">then you want to look at this picture, which
is from the 14th Century, and it’s a really</p>
<p t="1184080" d="5550">remarkable picture, so what you’ve got in
the middle here is the, the tree of the fruit</p>
<p t="1189630" d="5380">of the knowledge of good and evil, and you’ve
got Eve over here, and you’ve got the Church</p>
<p t="1195010" d="4540">here, and what you see happening, you got
to look really carefully at this tree ‘cause</p>
<p t="1199550" d="3720">the first thing you see is it’s got this
snake wrapped around it, this agent of transformation,</p>
<p t="1203270" d="7000">right, who’s associated with Satan, and
then up in the branches you have apples and</p>
<p t="1210760" d="7000">you have skulls, and then if you look at Eve
here, she’s got grapes here, and a skull</p>
<p t="1217910" d="5310">in her hand, and what this artist is trying
to indicate is that there’s this tight relationship</p>
<p t="1223220" d="7000">between Eve tempting Adam towards higher knowledge
and delivering him death.</p>
<p t="1231640" d="3380">so that’s a pretty dismal story, and all
the people over here on the left side, all</p>
<p t="1235020" d="5070">these unhappy people, are the people who are
living in chaos and misery as a consequence</p>
<p t="1240090" d="5450">of being, of having their vulnerability revealed
to them, and that’s the negative side of</p>
<p t="1245540" d="2210">the story,
but then there’s the positive side of the</p>
<p t="1247750" d="4070">story over here, and it’s, it’s just as
complicated, and that’s partly why it’s</p>
<p t="1251820" d="4640">expressed in imagistic form,
so you’ve got the Church here, symbolized</p>
<p t="1256460" d="5150">at least in part as Mary, and she’s handing
out something too, and if you look at those</p>
<p t="1261610" d="5500">they’re little round circles with crosses
on them, and what those are, are hosts, hosts,</p>
<p t="1267110" d="7000">they’re the symbols of transformation, particularly
in Catholicism; now that’s a very complicated</p>
<p t="1274450" d="3480">idea, and this is the idea, it’s something
like this:</p>
<p t="1277930" d="4960">At Christ’s last supper before he was crucified,
he told his disciples that they were going</p>
<p t="1282890" d="5870">to have to ingest him, right, so they gave
them wine and bread, and the wine was blood</p>
<p t="1288760" d="5940">and the bread was flesh, and what’s the
idea, what does it mean to incorporate someone?</p>
<p t="1294700" d="5390">It means to embody them, that’s what it
means, and this, this imagistic ritualistic</p>
<p t="1300090" d="6390">process, is the notion that in order to attain
redemption, it’s necessary to embody the</p>
<p t="1306480" d="3370">hero, and that’s kind of what this picture
is trying to portray,</p>
<p t="1309850" d="4830">it says, okay, well you got this death apple
over on the left-hand side, and that’s not</p>
<p t="1314680" d="5070">so good, and you need an antidote to it, and
the antidote is whatever this represents,</p>
<p t="1319750" d="4510">whatever this represents, and you see up in
the tree here there’s all these hosts hanging.</p>
<p t="1324260" d="3840">Now the hosts are representative of Christ,
and for complicated reasons they’re made</p>
<p t="1328100" d="4310">out of wheat, say, and partly the reason they’re
made out of wheat is because if you look at</p>
<p t="1332410" d="7000">hero Gods prior to Christianity, you see that
wheat was often conceptualized as a dying</p>
<p t="1339510" d="4460">and redeemed God, right, because it would
die in the Winter and then be re-born in the</p>
<p t="1343970" d="5800">Spring, just like all plants are, and the
notion of the dying and redeeming, the dying</p>
<p t="1349770" d="6700">and resurrecting hero, was kind of, what would
you say, layered on top of that older agrarian</p>
<p t="1356470" d="3330">idea, and all mixed together, and it sort
of popped out in this idea of the, of the</p>
<p t="1359800" d="3330">host,
and so the idea here is that whatever ails</p>
<p t="1363130" d="6710">human beings, which is their knowledge of
vulnerability and death, can be rectified</p>
<p t="1369840" d="4460">by their incorporation of whatever this symbol
represents,</p>
<p t="1374300" d="4570">and so then you might ask, well what exactly
does that symbol represent, and, of course,</p>
<p t="1378870" d="5330">the standard Christian answers to that, and
the extended Christian answers are, well it</p>
<p t="1384200" d="5150">represents your faith in Christ, say, but
that’s not a very useful answer, all things</p>
<p t="1389350" d="4560">considered, so let’s look at it in a little
bit more complicated way.</p>
<p t="1393910" d="6400">It’s not a useful answer I think because
it’s too sectarian, right, it excludes many,</p>
<p t="1400310" d="4080">many people, this notion, and there’s a
whole formalism that you have to buy into</p>
<p t="1404390" d="5170">to even get access to what that story means,
and it’s an unfortunate formalism because</p>
<p t="1409560" d="4190">first of all I think it’s more appropriate
to an earlier time and place, and second of</p>
<p t="1413750" d="6840">all because I think we’re actually sophisticated
enough now intellectually, psychologically,</p>
<p t="1420590" d="2740">to actually start to understand what some
of these stories mean,</p>
<p t="1423330" d="3990">and since we have reasonably well-developed
brains, and we might as well use them, it</p>
<p t="1427320" d="4530">would be better if they were on our side,
so to speak, than constantly conspiring to</p>
<p t="1431850" d="7000">undermine our faith,
let&#39;s look at what a person is like. And a</p>
<p t="1441670" d="4860">person is sort of just as complicated as a,
an object, which is not that surprising cause</p>
<p t="1446530" d="5330">there&#39;s an aspect of us that is object like,
right? Our objective being.</p>
<p t="1451860" d="6650">And we know people are unbelievably complicated.
They have they have nervous systems that have</p>
<p t="1458510" d="4950">more connections in them than there are subatomic
particles in the universe, just for starters.</p>
<p t="1463460" d="3820">And so that means that when you&#39;re looking
at another person, you&#39;re looking at something</p>
<p t="1467280" d="5250">that&#39;s more complicated than anything else
that exists anywhere, including the sum total</p>
<p t="1472530" d="5670">of everything that exists everywhere, except
other people. More complex than everything.</p>
<p t="1478200" d="3810">And then you have to understand too that just
because you don&#39;t think of yourself that way</p>
<p t="1482010" d="4890">doesn’t mean you&#39;re not that way.
It just means that you&#39;re conscious mind,</p>
<p t="1486900" d="6370">your rational mind say isn&#39;t sophisticated
enough to actually completely model who or</p>
<p t="1493270" d="5130">what you are. And that&#39;s obvious because that&#39;s
why we study ourselves. We don&#39;t know who</p>
<p t="1498400" d="2440">we are. We&#39;re trying to figure it out. We&#39;ve
been trying to figure it out ever since we</p>
<p t="1500840" d="5480">woke some thousands of years ago. We don&#39;t
know when</p>
<p t="1506320" d="3670">And you think well if you look at people,
well you know, there&#39;s the kind of obvious</p>
<p t="1509990" d="4830">level that you see people at, the self level,
which is the privileged level of analysis</p>
<p t="1514820" d="5170">for the west. But you’re a member of a family.
And if I said well are you more yourself or</p>
<p t="1519990" d="4660">your family, you might say well, most of the
time I think I&#39;m more myself, but I might</p>
<p t="1524650" d="5350">be willing to sacrifice my life for my child&#39;s.
In which case I would say well, then you’re</p>
<p t="1530000" d="4070">just as much your child as you are you. Or
maybe you’re even more your child. And what</p>
<p t="1534070" d="5120">about your family? Well that&#39;s a tough question
too. And then what about your cultural group?</p>
<p t="1539190" d="4180">Well you say no, it&#39;s me, not my cultural
group. But then I&#39;d say well what if there&#39;s</p>
<p t="1543370" d="5520">a war? Is it you or your cultural group? And
then you’ll say oh it&#39;s my cultural group.</p>
<p t="1548890" d="7000">And then you see as well, well at this level
of analysis are you your biological group?</p>
<p t="1556120" d="5110">Is that what you identify with, the biosphere
say? Say well no, not generally. But there&#39;s</p>
<p t="1561230" d="5270">a lot of environmentalists out there. And
they say well what we should primarily be</p>
<p t="1566500" d="4780">concerned with is the global health of the
planet because our survival depends on that.</p>
<p t="1571280" d="4230">We&#39;re as much that as we are the self. And
you might not agree with that. And I suspect</p>
<p t="1575510" d="4760">that most of the time there&#39;s screwy reasons
for proposing such a thing. But on the other</p>
<p t="1580270" d="4840">hand, a case can be made.
I mean we know that you can undermine your</p>
<p t="1585110" d="4160">ecosystems. It happened in Spain. They let,
four hundred years ago they let the sheep</p>
<p t="1589270" d="4590">eat everything. And so Spain turned into a
desert. Doesn&#39;t seem like a particularly wise</p>
<p t="1593860" d="3700">move.
And then you think well below the phenomenological</p>
<p t="1597560" d="4600">level there&#39;s all these sub elements of you,
your physiological structure, your cellular</p>
<p t="1602160" d="7000">structure, your atomic structure. To infinite
investigation. Absolutely complex. You&#39;ll</p>
<p t="1609670" d="4340">never exhaust it if you investigate it. And
it&#39;s perfectly reasonable to presuppose that</p>
<p t="1614010" d="1000">you&#39;re all these things</p>
<p t="1615010" d="6940">How does it change the world if you stop thinking
about it as made of objects? But, but instead</p>
<p t="1621950" d="3460">made of your own experience. And how does
it change the world if you think you have</p>
<p t="1625410" d="5410">an ethical relationship with that experience
that, that&#39;s a primary fact, not some secondary</p>
<p t="1630820" d="5140">derivative. So primary a fact that you can&#39;t
even look at the world except through an ethical</p>
<p t="1635960" d="5210">lens, primary fact. What is, how does that
change the way you conceptualize yourself</p>
<p t="1641170" d="4930">in relationship to the world? I don&#39;t know.</p>
