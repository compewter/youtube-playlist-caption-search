<p t="500" d="3170">JORDAN PETERSON: Well, I took my first degree in political science.</p>
<p t="3670" d="4040">And I was interested in motivation for social conflict, primarily.</p>
<p t="7710" d="4530">And at the time I took my degree-- and I suppose it&#39;s probably similar now--</p>
<p t="12240" d="3780">all the explanations for social conflict were economic.</p>
<p t="16020" d="4330">People are basically fighting over resources of one form or another.</p>
<p t="20350" d="4130">And that just struck me as wrong.</p>
<p t="24480" d="1530">It&#39;s too simple.</p>
<p t="26010" d="5040">And it also doesn&#39;t explain why people value certain resources.</p>
<p t="31050" d="4240">It&#39;s not self-evident that a resource has value.</p>
<p t="35290" d="2840">It depends very much on the cultural context.</p>
<p t="38130" d="4590">And it is-- also didn&#39;t seem to me to take into account the relationship</p>
<p t="42720" d="2310">between belief and the individual.</p>
<p t="45030" d="2080">It was a purely economic explanation-- plus,</p>
<p t="47110" d="3740">then it&#39;s also predicated on an essentially economic view of men.</p>
<p t="50850" d="3080">It wasn&#39;t deep enough to really explain the issue.</p>
<p t="53930" d="3160">And at that time, too, it was in the early 80s</p>
<p t="57090" d="2240">when I really started to think about this,</p>
<p t="59330" d="2360">it was sort of the second peak of the Cold War.</p>
<p t="61690" d="4640">And people were very, very worried about nuclear destruction.</p>
<p t="66330" d="3660">You know, it was a constant background concern.</p>
<p t="69990" d="4380">And so part of what I was curious about was</p>
<p t="74370" d="2490">how belief could be important enough so that people</p>
<p t="76860" d="7020">would be willing to put life itself at risk to have produced this insane</p>
<p t="83880" d="3120">standoff with these tens of thousands of nuclear weapons.</p>
<p t="87000" d="1860">And then there was something beyond that too</p>
<p t="88860" d="4350">because you can explain some of that with just just with territoriality,</p>
<p t="93210" d="3540">but there was more-- there was an element of gratuitous violence</p>
<p t="96750" d="5100">that characterize situations like those in Nazi Germany,</p>
<p t="101850" d="4110">and also in the Stalinist camps, and in lots of other places as well.</p>
<p t="105960" d="2220">But those were the two that really stood out for me</p>
<p t="108180" d="2550">that I felt couldn&#39;t be explained by--</p>
<p t="110730" d="4437">well, certainly not by a resource theory, or even really by a theory</p>
<p t="115167" d="1833">that had anything to do with territoriality.</p>
<p t="117000" d="5460">There was some other element that was more metaphysical that</p>
<p t="122460" d="1440">wasn&#39;t being attended to.</p>
<p t="123900" d="2340">You just couldn&#39;t account for those sorts of things.</p>
<p t="126240" d="2429">You know, it&#39;s one thing to kill people.</p>
<p t="128669" d="3931">You can even make a rational account for that under many circumstances.</p>
<p t="132600" d="4830">But to make them as miserable as possible while you&#39;re killing them,</p>
<p t="137430" d="3210">and then also to do it in a manner that&#39;s counterproductive with regards</p>
<p t="140640" d="4290">to your own ends-- because that clearly happened in Nazi Germany--</p>
<p t="144930" d="4730">that&#39;s not-- there&#39;s no straightforward rational explanation for that.</p>
<p t="149660" d="2850">So I started reading more and more about that.</p>
<p t="152510" d="2820">There was something about, especially, the archetypes</p>
<p t="155330" d="2490">of the collective unconscious, reading that in relationship</p>
<p t="157820" d="3150">to the Gulag Archipelago, that I felt that there was something there</p>
<p t="160970" d="3480">that really bore further investigation.</p>
<p t="164450" d="2640">You know, when Solzhenitsyn, for example, he</p>
<p t="167090" d="7370">concentrated a lot on the relationship between individual deceit,</p>
<p t="174460" d="4890">particularly, lying, to put it simply, and the path elegies of the state.</p>
<p t="179350" d="1920">Makes a very clear case for that.</p>
<p t="181270" d="4880">And I always sort of interpreted Freud&#39;s idea of a repression as a form of lie.</p>
<p t="186150" d="5714">Now, I don&#39;t think his account of repression is correct.</p>
<p t="191864" d="916">But it doesn&#39;t matter.</p>
<p t="192780" d="3220">It&#39;s interestingly wrong, at least, or it&#39;s approximately right,</p>
<p t="196000" d="1260">something like that.</p>
<p t="197260" d="5030">And then there was a weird connection between this idea</p>
<p t="202290" d="6180">of the lie as the root of pathology in totalitarian states</p>
<p t="208470" d="4660">and archetypal religious ideas that were associated</p>
<p t="213130" d="1740">with the idea of good and evil.</p>
<p t="214870" d="3630">And so that started to attract my attention.</p>
<p t="218500" d="3630">I was probably about 20.</p>
<p t="222130" d="920">It was 1982.</p>
<p t="223050" d="1570">Yeah, I was 20.</p>
<p t="224620" d="1950">And I was also reading Nietzsche at that time.</p>
<p t="226570" d="2560">And I read everything that he wrote that--</p>
<p t="229130" d="1150">of his major works.</p>
<p t="230280" d="2500">I mean, the whole collected works hadn&#39;t been published yet,</p>
<p t="232780" d="3490">but I read him in chronological order.</p>
<p t="236270" d="2240">And that was extremely interesting for me, as well.</p>
<p t="238510" d="2520">And there&#39;s a very interesting intellectual relationship</p>
<p t="241030" d="3570">between Nietzsche and Jung and Solzhenitsyn.</p>
<p t="244600" d="3570">The Solzhenitsyn connection is more through Dostoevsky.</p>
<p t="248170" d="2130">You know, when Dostoevsky and Jung, or Nietzsche,</p>
<p t="250300" d="5110">were investigating very, very similar ideas at exactly the same time.</p>
<p t="255410" d="2750">So there&#39;s these weird parallelisms of thought.</p>
<p t="258160" d="3929">And although people don&#39;t know it well, Jung</p>
<p t="262089" d="4051">was extremely influenced by Nietzsche, just as much as by Freud.</p>
<p t="266140" d="3360">I mean, there is a publication, for example,</p>
<p t="269500" d="5050">that&#39;s notes on his seminar on Thus Spoke Zarathustra,</p>
<p t="274550" d="1940">and it&#39;s like 2,600 pages long.</p>
<p t="276490" d="3480">And it only covers the first third of Thus Spoke Zarathustra.</p>
<p t="279970" d="2740">So Jung was very interested in Nietzsche.</p>
<p t="282710" d="3230">So this-- I found this source of ideas, which I suppose</p>
<p t="285940" d="4020">was grounded in some sense in 19th century romanticism, that</p>
<p t="289960" d="6910">seemed to really get at the root of the question as far as I was concerned.</p>
<p t="296870" d="4070">So because there&#39;s something-- there&#39;s something that isn&#39;t just--</p>
<p t="300940" d="3780">it&#39;s not just rational behavior that drives people towards war.</p>
<p t="304720" d="4080">There&#39;s an irrational element of it that you can&#39;t explain without--</p>
<p t="308800" d="3970">I don&#39;t think you can explain it at all without recourse to religious language.</p>
<p t="312770" d="3330">It&#39;s the only language that&#39;s deep enough to get at it properly.</p>
<p t="316100" d="5520">So I started reading all this--</p>
<p t="321620" d="4060">like, I didn&#39;t understand the archetypes of the collective unconscious at all.</p>
<p t="325680" d="910">So I read it again.</p>
<p t="326590" d="1041">And then I read it again.</p>
<p t="327631" d="3989">And then I then I started to understand what he was talking about a little bit,</p>
<p t="331620" d="2580">you know, the idea that these--</p>
<p t="334200" d="4840">that there were patterns of action and perception in a sense,</p>
<p t="339040" d="4070">or cognitive categories-- that&#39;s another way of looking at it--</p>
<p t="343110" d="2990">that lie at the bottom of our thoughts.</p>
<p t="346100" d="2320">They structure the way that we look at the world.</p>
<p t="348420" d="3870">And they a deep evolutionary basis.</p>
<p t="352290" d="6070">And they have the quality, in a sense, of God.</p>
<p t="358360" d="2610">And that really frightened me, that idea.</p>
<p t="360970" d="2430">You know, one thing Jung said-- which I really love--</p>
<p t="363400" d="3520">he said, people don&#39;t have ideas.</p>
<p t="366920" d="1540">Ideas have people.</p>
<p t="368460" d="1490">I thought oh, yeah.</p>
<p t="369950" d="2130">That&#39;s a really interesting way of looking.</p>
<p t="372080" d="2820">It&#39;s like Richard Dawkins&#39; idea of meme.</p>
<p t="374900" d="1830">It&#39;s funny to read Dawkins because Dawkins</p>
<p t="376730" d="2790">is someone who is almost to the point where</p>
<p t="379520" d="3570">he could read Jung because his idea of memes and the archetypes</p>
<p t="383090" d="3300">are very, very close, except the meme is a trivial concept compared</p>
<p t="386390" d="1410">to the archetype.</p>
<p t="387800" d="3820">So an archetype is like meta meme, in a sense.</p>
<p t="391620" d="500">It&#39;s deep.</p>
<p t="392120" d="6810">It&#39;s so ancient that it&#39;s tangled up in our biology.</p>
<p t="398930" d="6270">So Dawkins, even though he&#39;s an evolutionary thinker,</p>
<p t="405200" d="2761">is still like post-enlightenment rationalist.</p>
<p t="407961" d="2249">You actually can&#39;t be a post-enlightenment rationalist</p>
<p t="410210" d="1550">and an evolutionary thinker.</p>
<p t="411760" d="2160">That doesn&#39;t work.</p>
<p t="413920" d="3020">Well, you&#39;re too concerned with rationality.</p>
<p t="416940" d="1415">Rationality is new.</p>
<p t="418355" d="2115">It hardly even matters in some sense.</p>
<p t="423110" d="9450">Anyway, so I was obsessed with the idea of destruction and the will to destroy,</p>
<p t="432560" d="2940">fundamentally, and its expression and totalitarianism,</p>
<p t="435500" d="3920">and then, its relationship with the history of ideas, in general.</p>
<p t="439420" d="3160">That&#39;s partly why I found Nietzsche so useful because Nietzsche</p>
<p t="442580" d="4640">predicted that the 20th century would be a war, in some sense, between--</p>
<p t="447220" d="6420">well, certainly a war that would involve communist ideas.</p>
<p t="453640" d="4700">He predicted that in about 1860, something like that, in Will to Power.</p>
<p t="458340" d="2950">He said, you know, we&#39;ll pay for that conflict</p>
<p t="461290" d="4140">with a couple of tens of millions of lives,</p>
<p t="465430" d="4650">which is quite the prognostication like, 30 years before the fact.</p>
<p t="470080" d="5720">And then he also talked about nihilism and both of those as a reaction</p>
<p t="475800" d="3140">to the collapse of Christianity.</p>
<p t="478940" d="1930">And that struck me as highly plausible.</p>
<p t="484030" d="2250">So Nietzsche was also extremely useful.</p>
<p t="486280" d="4110">One of the things about Jung is that Jung spent his whole career trying</p>
<p t="490390" d="3060">to answer Nietzsche&#39;s question.</p>
<p t="493450" d="6560">So Nietzsche said, basically, that the conflict between enlightenment thinking</p>
<p t="500010" d="1320">and religious thinking--</p>
<p t="501330" d="1920">Christian thinking, in particular-- was going</p>
<p t="503250" d="2820">to wipe Christian thinking out, or at least people&#39;s ability</p>
<p t="506070" d="3480">to believe in the metaphysical assumptions that underlie Christianity,</p>
<p t="509550" d="3150">and that the only proper response to that</p>
<p t="512700" d="3209">would be nihilism, which he was very much concerned with,</p>
<p t="515909" d="2341">or authoritarianism.</p>
<p t="518250" d="6160">And so Nietzsche was trying to develop a philosophy</p>
<p t="524410" d="4879">of what might constitute a third path.</p>
<p t="529289" d="1791">And that&#39;s expressed to some degree in Thus</p>
<p t="531080" d="3780">Spoke Zarathustra with the idea of the Superman or the Overman.</p>
<p t="534860" d="3240">But that idea really never got developed.</p>
<p t="538100" d="3420">In fact, Jung believed that the development of that idea</p>
<p t="541520" d="3070">was part of what drove Nietzsche insane.</p>
<p t="544590" d="5850">He thought that he developed a kind of schizophrenic inflation.</p>
<p t="550440" d="5320">Jung believed that inflation was the invasion of the conscious ego</p>
<p t="555760" d="1740">with archetypal content.</p>
<p t="557500" d="6060">And so it&#39;s almost like, when the old hero dies, a new hero was born.</p>
<p t="563560" d="4740">And that new hero, in some sense, was born within Nietzsche consciousness.</p>
<p t="568300" d="5190">But those are experiences that are powerful enough, in some sense,</p>
<p t="573490" d="2280">to have a psychotic element to them.</p>
<p t="575770" d="3100">And anyways, Nietzsche died before he developed those ideas very far.</p>
<p t="578870" d="3350">But then Jung spent his entire career, in some sense,</p>
<p t="582220" d="3480">trying to understand hero mythology fundamentally.</p>
<p t="585700" d="2250">SPEAKER: And today, as well, there are a lot of people</p>
<p t="587950" d="3480">who insist that religion or otherwise supernatural belief systems</p>
<p t="591430" d="4150">or mythologies are relics from the past, that they&#39;re, you</p>
<p t="595580" d="3200">know, from another era, and they&#39;re either naive, faulty descriptions</p>
<p t="598780" d="4860">of actual material reality, the same way that we think of science today.</p>
<p t="603640" d="5549">Or there were kind of crowd control tools of elites--</p>
<p t="609189" d="2791">JORDAN PETERSON: Yeah, they are straw man arguments, fundamentally.</p>
<p t="611980" d="2190">I mean, one of them is just Marxist.</p>
<p t="614170" d="2440">You know, it&#39;s like, what are power structures there for?</p>
<p t="616610" d="2291">Well, they&#39;re there to serve the purposes of the elite.</p>
<p t="618901" d="2919">It&#39;s like, no, that&#39;s one of their purposes.</p>
<p t="621820" d="6090">You know, that mono mania, that insane desire for singular causes,</p>
<p t="627910" d="2480">to me, that&#39;s also the expression of an archetype.</p>
<p t="630390" d="1840">That&#39;s monotheism in action.</p>
<p t="632230" d="5430">It&#39;s like, you know, so you see these people who claim to be atheistic.</p>
<p t="637660" d="1440">They just invent a new god.</p>
<p t="639100" d="1650">Foucalt did that with power.</p>
<p t="640750" d="1680">Freud did that with sex.</p>
<p t="642430" d="4300">You know, if you&#39;re smart, too, you can take a major motivational drive</p>
<p t="646730" d="3620">or system-- they&#39;re not really drives; they&#39;re really personalities--</p>
<p t="650350" d="3420">you can take a major motivational personality like power or sex,</p>
<p t="653770" d="5900">and you can explain everything on its basis because everything is--</p>
<p t="659670" d="3830">every human action is motivated by the major motivational system,</p>
<p t="663500" d="1322">some admixture of them.</p>
<p t="664822" d="2708">And then, if you&#39;re smart enough, you can always figure out a way</p>
<p t="667530" d="4470">that some complex phenomena is related causally to some simpler motivation.</p>
<p t="672000" d="2950">But it&#39;s intellectual masturbation, as far as I&#39;m concerned.</p>
<p t="674950" d="2460">It&#39;s not the attempt to explain something.</p>
<p t="677410" d="4760">It&#39;s the attempt to reduce everything to one simple principle</p>
<p t="682170" d="2250">that you can be master of.</p>
<p t="684420" d="4240">Now, so, you know, was religion for crowd control?</p>
<p t="688660" d="2630">Well, it&#39;s just a--</p>
<p t="691290" d="1920">that&#39;s an empty theory.</p>
<p t="693210" d="4620">Well, what-- so this is what, a multi-generational conspiracy?</p>
<p t="697830" d="750">That&#39;s what it is.</p>
<p t="698580" d="3690">It&#39;s a conspiracy that stretches as far back into the past</p>
<p t="702270" d="3720">as we can imagine, right back to where people were tribal, and maybe farther</p>
<p t="705990" d="1680">back than that.</p>
<p t="707670" d="2250">I mean, that&#39;s not an explanation.</p>
<p t="709920" d="7240">And the other one, the supernatural explanation-- well, you know,</p>
<p t="717160" d="1770">there are--</p>
<p t="718930" d="3366">there are people who think they think scientifically,</p>
<p t="722296" d="2124">but they don&#39;t because they&#39;re not very good at it.</p>
<p t="724420" d="3299">And then there are people who think scientifically at a genius level.</p>
<p t="727719" d="2791">It&#39;s like, well, there are people who think they think religiously,</p>
<p t="730510" d="650">but don&#39;t.</p>
<p t="731160" d="3070">And then there are people who think religiously at a genius level.</p>
<p t="734230" d="4890">And you can&#39;t assume that you can use the same motivational explanation</p>
<p t="739120" d="2860">at every single level of analysis.</p>
<p t="741980" d="2990">So yes, there are elements of religious belief</p>
<p t="744970" d="4410">that are superstitious, although, you know, that&#39;s kind of a sleight of hand</p>
<p t="749380" d="4710">too because if you want to argue that religion is only superstition,</p>
<p t="754090" d="3690">you collect up all the superstitions, you define them as religious,</p>
<p t="757780" d="3270">and then you define religion as a collection of superstitions.</p>
<p t="761050" d="4950">So you know, it&#39;s not very careful articulation</p>
<p t="766000" d="3510">of the whole class of phenomena that are attempting to be--</p>
<p t="769510" d="3300">that people are attempting to explain.</p>
<p t="772810" d="4850">And there&#39;s also a big difference between explaining and explaining away.</p>
<p t="777660" d="5430">So well, Dennett likes to explain away things, like consciousness.</p>
<p t="783090" d="2520">And you can&#39;t explain away consciousness.</p>
<p t="785610" d="1140">Well, you can.</p>
<p t="786750" d="4960">It depends on how you structure your initial presumptions about the world.</p>
<p t="791710" d="4220">So the logos that we were talking about earlier that&#39;s associated with, let&#39;s</p>
<p t="795930" d="2880">say, articulated truth, and the communication</p>
<p t="798810" d="5330">of articulated truth, that&#39;s basically the prime function of consciousness.</p>
<p t="804140" d="5110">And the Judeo Christian story is predicated on the idea</p>
<p t="809250" d="4960">that that is a fundamental element of being.</p>
<p t="814210" d="3700">Now, you can structure your world with different presuppositions.</p>
<p t="817910" d="4420">So you could say, well, consciousness is epi-phenomena of the material world.</p>
<p t="822330" d="4260">Well, you can make a perfectly coherent and useful set</p>
<p t="826590" d="2130">of tools out of those pre-suppositions.</p>
<p t="828720" d="4920">But that set of tools does not cover everything that you need.</p>
<p t="833640" d="3960">And it&#39;s no more viable as an explanation than the explanation</p>
<p t="837600" d="4170">that no consciousness is somehow fundamental to being.</p>
<p t="841770" d="4230">And of course, being is different than material reality.</p>
<p t="846000" d="3420">So-- and these things aren&#39;t grappled with properly</p>
<p t="849420" d="7670">by positivistic scientists who have no real training in philosophy</p>
<p t="857090" d="2550">and who knew nothing at all about religion.</p>
<p t="859640" d="2160">You know, their religion, the Christianity</p>
<p t="861800" d="2580">that Dawkins criticizes is the Christianity</p>
<p t="864380" d="3210">that a smart 13-year-old boy objects to.</p>
<p t="867590" d="2340">So it&#39;s like, well, you know, how can you reconcile</p>
<p t="869930" d="1920">Genesis with evolutionary history?</p>
<p t="871850" d="2920">It&#39;s like well, no, that&#39;s really not the problem.</p>
<p t="874770" d="2810">So it&#39;s a straw man argument.</p>
<p t="877580" d="960">Hello, ugly.</p>
<p t="878540" d="1830">You better sit.</p>
<p t="880370" d="1250">Sit.</p>
<p t="881620" d="1150">Lay down.</p>
<p t="882770" d="1910">Lay down.</p>
<p t="884680" d="2310">One of the things that I&#39;ve learned about argumentation</p>
<p t="886990" d="5150">is that if you&#39;re trying to distinguish between the validity of two</p>
<p t="892140" d="5010">different worldviews, you want to make the strongest</p>
<p t="897150" d="3420">possible case for both worldviews.</p>
<p t="900570" d="2310">You&#39;re not trying to be right.</p>
<p t="902880" d="1990">You&#39;re trying to figure something out.</p>
<p t="904870" d="3800">And the easiest way to be right is to make your opponent into an idiot.</p>
<p t="908670" d="5920">So there&#39;s no doubt that empirical science</p>
<p t="914590" d="4120">has kicked the slats out of the way people</p>
<p t="918710" d="5900">think about religion because it wasn&#39;t easy for people to understand</p>
<p t="924610" d="1444">that there could be different--</p>
<p t="928780" d="3780">that different systems of thought might have different purposes.</p>
<p t="932560" d="4550">You have to be a philosopher of thought to think about that, even.</p>
<p t="937110" d="3170">And I don&#39;t think it was--</p>
<p t="940280" d="6700">I don&#39;t think that became obvious at all until after Nietzsche.</p>
<p t="946980" d="5720">Not all belief systems serve the same masters, so to speak.</p>
<p t="952700" d="3730">And so you can&#39;t assume that every system of thought</p>
<p t="956430" d="1290">is doing the same thing.</p>
<p t="960240" d="3490">And then, you can&#39;t assume also, that there&#39;s</p>
<p t="963730" d="4700">only one way to formulate your basic assumptions</p>
<p t="968430" d="2550">about the nature of reality.</p>
<p t="970980" d="930">I mean, Heidegger.</p>
<p t="971910" d="4110">I didn&#39;t discover the relationship between the system of thought</p>
<p t="976020" d="5280">that I derived say, from Nietzsche and Jung and some other people that I read,</p>
<p t="981300" d="4440">and Heidegger, until much after I had written Maps of Meaning.</p>
<p t="985740" d="4020">But Heidegger&#39;s study of being is predicated</p>
<p t="989760" d="2460">on the idea that being is the fundamental reality,</p>
<p t="992220" d="1920">and that is not objective reality.</p>
<p t="994140" d="1140">It&#39;s not material reality.</p>
<p t="995280" d="2220">It&#39;s lived experience, something like that.</p>
<p t="997500" d="2620">Lived experience is real.</p>
<p t="1000120" d="500">OK.</p>
<p t="1000620" d="1677">That&#39;s a pre-supposition.</p>
<p t="1002297" d="1833">So you start with that pre-supposition, then</p>
<p t="1004130" d="3600">you ask yourself, well, what are the basic elements of lived reality?</p>
<p t="1007730" d="1322">And then, what happens there--</p>
<p t="1009052" d="1708">or at least what seems to have happened--</p>
<p t="1010760" d="5250">is that Heidegger identified the same basic elements of lived reality</p>
<p t="1016010" d="1830">that I identified in Maps of Meaning.</p>
<p t="1017840" d="4010">And one was the social world--</p>
<p t="1021850" d="2249">the world that&#39;s constructed by humans--</p>
<p t="1024099" d="4470">which I think is basically an elaborated dominance hierarchy.</p>
<p t="1028569" d="1831">And it&#39;s permanent.</p>
<p t="1030400" d="2820">So this is where the issue about what constitutes reality</p>
<p t="1033220" d="1349">becomes very critical.</p>
<p t="1034569" d="3481">Dominance hierarchies are 300 million years old.</p>
<p t="1038050" d="2220">They&#39;re older than trees.</p>
<p t="1040270" d="1980">So if you think that&#39;s-- what--</p>
<p t="1042250" d="5020">one definition of what&#39;s real is what&#39;s persistent across time,</p>
<p t="1047270" d="5150">then it&#39;s almost impossible to find anything more real about life</p>
<p t="1052420" d="1160">than a dominance hierarchy.</p>
<p t="1053580" d="500">So--</p>
<p t="1054080" d="1790">SPEAKER: This goes to your point about lobster, I think.</p>
<p t="1055870" d="720">JORDAN PETERSON: Absolutely.</p>
<p t="1056590" d="690">Absolutely.</p>
<p t="1057280" d="2820">It&#39;s the same bloody circuitry, serotonergic circuitry.</p>
<p t="1060100" d="2070">I mean, there&#39;s another circuit that lobsters</p>
<p t="1062170" d="3180">use that we don&#39;t have that&#39;s based on octomine,</p>
<p t="1065350" d="1590">I think that&#39;s the right word.</p>
<p t="1066940" d="4170">But a lot of the way that lobsters maneuver within dominance hierarchies</p>
<p t="1071110" d="2520">is the way we maneuver within dominance hierarchies.</p>
<p t="1073630" d="3810">If you&#39;re an evolutionary thinker, you can&#39;t just push that away.</p>
<p t="1077440" d="2670">And dominance hierarchies are--</p>
<p t="1080110" d="3570">although we can think about them as a social construct--</p>
<p t="1083680" d="3600">they&#39;re also a natural phenomena, right?</p>
<p t="1087280" d="3030">So the dominant hierarchy is actually a major part</p>
<p t="1090310" d="2831">of the environment to which we have adapted.</p>
<p t="1093141" d="499">OK.</p>
<p t="1093640" d="2400">So there&#39;s the dominance hierarchy, that&#39;s--</p>
<p t="1096040" d="2430">we&#39;ll say the social world, for the sake of argument.</p>
<p t="1098470" d="1710">There&#39;s the natural world.</p>
<p t="1100180" d="2280">And there is the experiencing subject.</p>
<p t="1102460" d="2940">Well, those are Heidegger&#39;s categories of being as well.</p>
<p t="1105400" d="6030">And in some sense, what religious thinking seems to do</p>
<p t="1111430" d="4860">is to continually posit those three things as interacting causally</p>
<p t="1116290" d="2330">at the base of being.</p>
<p t="1118620" d="4420">So-- and that&#39;s not material reality.</p>
<p t="1123040" d="3990">There&#39;s a lot of things about being that we can&#39;t attribute simply</p>
<p t="1127030" d="1620">to material reality.</p>
<p t="1128650" d="1690">We may eventually be able to do that.</p>
<p t="1130340" d="3080">But by that time, our notion of what constitutes material</p>
<p t="1133420" d="1720">will be much different.</p>
<p t="1135140" d="500">OK.</p>
<p t="1135640" d="3570">So we can&#39;t deal with subjectivity within the confines</p>
<p t="1139210" d="1690">of our materialist theories.</p>
<p t="1140900" d="2180">And that&#39;s partly because those theories are</p>
<p t="1143080" d="5610">predicated on the elimination of subjectivity as an a priori move,</p>
<p t="1148690" d="540">right?</p>
<p t="1149230" d="3701">The whole point of objective science is to remove subjectivity.</p>
<p t="1152931" d="499">OK.</p>
<p t="1153430" d="2952">So then it gets removed and while you&#39;re surprised about it.</p>
<p t="1156382" d="2208">It&#39;s like, well, no, you can&#39;t be surprised about it.</p>
<p t="1158590" d="2070">You removed it right at the beginning.</p>
<p t="1160660" d="2470">Now, that works for certain purposes.</p>
<p t="1163130" d="1670">It works very well.</p>
<p t="1164800" d="1840">But it has consequences.</p>
<p t="1166640" d="2600">And some of those consequences, as far as I&#39;m concerned,</p>
<p t="1169240" d="7230">are serious enough to produce two forms of social and mental illness</p>
<p t="1176470" d="6480">and one of those would be succumbing to the temptations of authoritarianism.</p>
<p t="1182950" d="3330">And the other would be succumbing to the temptations of nihilism</p>
<p t="1186280" d="9750">because there are logical consequences of the definition of subjective</p>
<p t="1196030" d="1950">is non-real.</p>
<p t="1197980" d="3600">So now then you ask yourself, well, how do you determine whether or not</p>
<p t="1201580" d="1950">a theory is true?</p>
<p t="1203530" d="3450">Then you ask yourself, well, what do you mean by true?</p>
<p t="1206980" d="1720">Well, then you&#39;re in trouble.</p>
<p t="1208700" d="500">OK.</p>
<p t="1209200" d="2430">Because I think you can take a Newtonian perspective</p>
<p t="1211630" d="6520">on that or a Darwinian perspective, but you can&#39;t do both at the same time.</p>
<p t="1218150" d="1770">Yeah.</p>
<p t="1219920" d="2320">So Nietzsche said truth serves life.</p>
<p t="1222240" d="2960">OK, in some sense, that&#39;s a Darwinian idea.</p>
<p t="1225200" d="780">OK.</p>
<p t="1225980" d="4740">If it&#39;s true enough so that if you act it out or hold it</p>
<p t="1230720" d="3000">that increases your chances of survival and reproduction</p>
<p t="1233720" d="4340">over long spans of time, that&#39;s true.</p>
<p t="1238060" d="1370">OK.</p>
<p t="1239430" d="3540">We have no idea if our detailed knowledge about the material world</p>
<p t="1242970" d="3690">is going to be the type of knowledge that allows us to survive and reproduce</p>
<p t="1246660" d="1420">over a long period of time.</p>
<p t="1248080" d="3090">It&#39;s not been tested from a Darwinian perspective at all.</p>
<p t="1251170" d="4790">And you might say, well, of course the materialist perspective is right.</p>
<p t="1255960" d="1740">Look what we&#39;ve built with it.</p>
<p t="1257700" d="2980">We&#39;ve built hydrogen bombs, for example.</p>
<p t="1260680" d="4150">But then you might object to that by saying, well, yeah.</p>
<p t="1264830" d="1980">We&#39;ve built hydrogen bonds.</p>
<p t="1266810" d="3090">But the only reason we could build them or were willing to</p>
<p t="1269900" d="3180">was because we left things out of the equation.</p>
<p t="1273080" d="1350">Well, what things?</p>
<p t="1274430" d="2880">Well, things like, is it really a good idea</p>
<p t="1277310" d="3060">to build hydrogen bombs, for example?</p>
<p t="1280370" d="2799">I can give you another example of that.</p>
<p t="1283169" d="1791">I read a book a while back that was written</p>
<p t="1284960" d="4320">by a KGB officer who claimed to be exposing</p>
<p t="1289280" d="4170">the inner workings of the Soviet scientific community with regards</p>
<p t="1293450" d="3990">to biological warfare.</p>
<p t="1297440" d="2880">And the people in the Institute that he described</p>
<p t="1300320" d="5460">were trying to cross Ebola with smallpox because smallpox</p>
<p t="1305780" d="3930">is extremely infectious and Ebola is extremely deadly.</p>
<p t="1309710" d="5380">So like, that&#39;s a valid scientific enterprise.</p>
<p t="1315090" d="500">OK.</p>
<p t="1315590" d="2070">Then you think, oh, isn&#39;t that interesting</p>
<p t="1317660" d="2700">that that&#39;s a valid scientific enterprise?</p>
<p t="1320360" d="2460">Because obviously, that&#39;s insane.</p>
<p t="1322820" d="2850">So then you think, well, if it&#39;s so obvious that that&#39;s insane</p>
<p t="1325670" d="4710">and it&#39;s a valid scientific enterprise, well, there&#39;s</p>
<p t="1330380" d="3770">some disconnect there between two different views of what constitute</p>
<p t="1334150" d="1990">at least appropriate behavior.</p>
<p t="1336140" d="3470">Now, you know that this is why the definitions of truth</p>
<p t="1339610" d="1380">start to become so important.</p>
<p t="1340990" d="2310">Like, is it truth as expressed in action?</p>
<p t="1343300" d="3720">Is it truth as it serves Darwinian purposes?</p>
<p t="1347020" d="5070">Is it truth as defined by the axioms of the materialist philosophy-- which</p>
<p t="1352090" d="3540">by the way, aren&#39;t even true anymore, because if you go down far</p>
<p t="1355630" d="2700">enough into material reality, now we know</p>
<p t="1358330" d="4800">you hit a realm that&#39;s so bizarre that we can&#39;t even comprehend it.</p>
<p t="1363130" d="4020">And there&#39;s implications of that bizarreness that we can&#39;t comprehend.</p>
<p t="1367150" d="3671">So I would say we will develop a materialist philosophy of consciousness</p>
<p t="1370821" d="499">eventually.</p>
<p t="1371320" d="4900">But it won&#39;t be using the same material that we use now.</p>
<p t="1376220" d="2366">So--</p>
<p t="1378586" d="2374">SPEAKER: If I just interject-- if I understand correctly,</p>
<p t="1380960" d="2540">you&#39;re talking about--</p>
<p t="1383500" d="4530">there-- in, let&#39;s say, the industrialized north,</p>
<p t="1388030" d="7156">in a society that relies on site analysis to make its--</p>
<p t="1395186" d="3518">to establish the fundamental basis on which the rest of</p>
<p t="1398704" d="1476">the society is predicated--</p>
<p t="1400180" d="1050">JORDAN PETERSON: Yeah.</p>
<p t="1401230" d="1450">SPEAKER: There are certain assumptions about what</p>
<p t="1402680" d="1790">is real versus what is not real.</p>
<p t="1404470" d="2105">What is actually out there, if there&#39; a--</p>
<p t="1406575" d="1375">JORDAN PETERSON: Well, but well--</p>
<p t="1407950" d="1666">SPEAKER: A distinction between subject--</p>
<p t="1409616" d="3174">Well, but, but even there there&#39;s an implicit assumption</p>
<p t="1412790" d="2130">that&#39;s what&#39;s out there--</p>
<p t="1414920" d="2990">in objective space-- is what&#39;s real.</p>
<p t="1417910" d="2950">OK, well, but the problem with that is that that&#39;s</p>
<p t="1420860" d="2340">an assumption about reality.</p>
<p t="1423200" d="3060">Now, it&#39;s obviously a powerful assumption.</p>
<p t="1426260" d="3810">But here&#39;s another way of looking at the Darwinian problem,</p>
<p t="1430070" d="900">as far as I can tell.</p>
<p t="1430970" d="3570">So part of the reason that the Darwinians</p>
<p t="1434540" d="9010">insist that random mutation is the source of continual--</p>
<p t="1443550" d="5470">it&#39;s not progress-- continual survival is that the underlying environment</p>
<p t="1449020" d="4650">changes, and it changes unpredictably.</p>
<p t="1453670" d="2820">By its essential nature, it&#39;s unpredictable.</p>
<p t="1456490" d="4050">Thus, if it&#39;s unpredictable, only random transformation</p>
<p t="1460540" d="3540">can keep up with it, a lot of random transformation.</p>
<p t="1464080" d="3420">Hopefully, the randomness of the environmental change</p>
<p t="1467500" d="4010">will be matched by the randomness of the genetic change.</p>
<p t="1471510" d="1450">OK.</p>
<p t="1472960" d="5230">So what that means in part is that the environment, so to speak,</p>
<p t="1478190" d="4490">is finally incomprehensible because you can&#39;t predict it.</p>
<p t="1482680" d="1410">OK.</p>
<p t="1484090" d="3450">So that means that a limited creature that&#39;s</p>
<p t="1487540" d="5160">established itself by Darwinian means can&#39;t have access to the truth.</p>
<p t="1492700" d="2910">They can only have access to sufficient truth.</p>
<p t="1495610" d="3450">And sufficient truth is the truth that allows you to survive and reproduce.</p>
<p t="1499060" d="4770">And from a Darwinian perspective, there isn&#39;t any truth past that.</p>
<p t="1503830" d="3450">So I don&#39;t think Dawkins is a Darwinian.</p>
<p t="1507280" d="3640">I think he&#39;s a Newtonian because he believes that there is truth.</p>
<p t="1510920" d="1610">The Darwinians don&#39;t believe that.</p>
<p t="1512530" d="2860">The Darwinians say, no.</p>
<p t="1515390" d="4740">There&#39;s enough truth to keep you alive and have you survive.</p>
<p t="1520130" d="1580">And that&#39;s all.</p>
<p t="1521710" d="4620">And eventually all that&#39;s going to go to because, you know, 99.5% of all species</p>
<p t="1526330" d="1125">are extinct.</p>
<p t="1527455" d="2625">SPEAKER: That&#39;s an amazing point, if I understand it correctly.</p>
<p t="1530080" d="1958">JORDAN PETERSON: Look, the American pragmatists</p>
<p t="1532038" d="1532">figured this out in the late 1800s.</p>
<p t="1533570" d="710">SPEAKER: Exactly.</p>
<p t="1534280" d="1740">This reminds me of pragmatist philosophy,</p>
<p t="1536020" d="2346">specifically, which I have a soft spot for.</p>
<p t="1538366" d="1374">I mean, it speaks to me directly.</p>
<p t="1539740" d="2176">But I&#39;m thinking about other people who I know</p>
<p t="1541916" d="1994">at the university, the rest of my life.</p>
<p t="1543910" d="2110">If they hear this, they would just say, what?</p>
<p t="1546020" d="3640">Like, so it&#39;s as if we&#39;re living in two different worlds at the same time.</p>
<p t="1549660" d="1000">JORDAN PETERSON: We are.</p>
<p t="1550660" d="4920">SPEAKER: In the sense that we&#39;ve internalized the evolutionary mindset</p>
<p t="1555580" d="4160">for a large part and parcel of how we understand reality.</p>
<p t="1559740" d="3970">But at the same time we hold onto this notion of truth</p>
<p t="1563710" d="2737">as beyond our subjective experience of there.</p>
<p t="1566447" d="833">And we&#39;re actively--</p>
<p t="1567280" d="290">JORDAN PETERSON: Right.</p>
<p t="1567570" d="1990">SPEAKER: Directly, when we conduct these experiments.</p>
<p t="1569560" d="960">This is just true--</p>
<p t="1570520" d="958">JORDAN PETERSON: Right.</p>
<p t="1571478" d="1862">Well, a simple part of the problem too is</p>
<p t="1573340" d="6990">that because science is reductionistic, whenever you measure something</p>
<p t="1580330" d="2760">extremely accurately, there&#39;s a whole bunch of other things</p>
<p t="1583090" d="2100">you&#39;re not measuring.</p>
<p t="1585190" d="1740">And your assumption is that the knowledge</p>
<p t="1586930" d="8580">gained by that precision isn&#39;t undone by the dismissal of everything else.</p>
<p t="1595510" d="5920">Well, is that a valid claim?</p>
<p t="1601430" d="7610">It depends on what your preconditions are for determining validity.</p>
<p t="1609040" d="3750">Like, automobiles get you from point A to point</p>
<p t="1612790" d="3030">B. You might say, well, that&#39;s their fundamental purpose.</p>
<p t="1615820" d="1950">That&#39;s what they were designed to do.</p>
<p t="1617770" d="4710">But I could say, well, no, it turns out that there are fundamental consequence,</p>
<p t="1622480" d="3510">if not purpose, is the complete transformation of cities,</p>
<p t="1625990" d="4950">the demolition of the rural communities, and the destruction of the atmosphere.</p>
<p t="1630940" d="2850">It&#39;s like, oh, we left something out.</p>
<p t="1633790" d="3670">Yeah, you left something out.</p>
<p t="1637460" d="7570">So you gain-- you gain precision.</p>
<p t="1645030" d="2869">But you pay for it with the loss of something else.</p>
<p t="1647899" d="3041">And then there&#39;s the other problem, which is the pragmatic problem, which</p>
<p t="1650940" d="3320">is truth for what?</p>
<p t="1656910" d="6050">You know, it&#39;s difficult for me to say--</p>
<p t="1662960" d="3550">see that it&#39;s dangerous, as far as I&#39;m concerned,</p>
<p t="1666510" d="8880">to consider truth independent of its effect on us.</p>
<p t="1675390" d="4620">So I think if the truth drives you insane, it&#39;s not a truth.</p>
<p t="1680010" d="1470">There&#39;s something wrong with it.</p>
<p t="1681480" d="1110">That&#39;s like a definition.</p>
<p t="1685710" d="3580">But I think it&#39;s a definition that&#39;s grounded in Darwinian thinking.</p>
<p t="1689290" d="5850">And I think what I think about religion is very Darwinian.</p>
<p t="1695140" d="3220">I think religion is an evolved--</p>
<p t="1698360" d="2300">it&#39;s evolved knowledge.</p>
<p t="1700660" d="2710">And it&#39;s knowledge about action.</p>
<p t="1703370" d="3420">And the world is made out of action--</p>
<p t="1706790" d="1610">especially the human world--</p>
<p t="1708400" d="2560">and so you can&#39;t say well, that&#39;s not real.</p>
<p t="1710960" d="1740">It&#39;s like, that&#39;s wrong.</p>
<p t="1712700" d="1080">It&#39;s real.</p>
<p t="1713780" d="3930">It&#39;s not something you can easily reduce to causal relationships</p>
<p t="1717710" d="3210">between the fundamental building blocks of matter.</p>
<p t="1720920" d="4156">But not only is it real, everyone acts like it&#39;s real.</p>
<p t="1725076" d="1874">And then I would say, well, I don&#39;t care what</p>
<p t="1726950" d="2640">people say about what they think about what&#39;s real.</p>
<p t="1729590" d="2850">I care about how they act because that actually</p>
<p t="1732440" d="2490">shows what they really believe.</p>
<p t="1734930" d="3300">And whatever their rational mind is computing and, you know,</p>
<p t="1738230" d="3870">chattering about on the surface, it&#39;s like, who cares about that?</p>
<p t="1742100" d="2880">They&#39;re just possessed by ideas.</p>
<p t="1744980" d="2940">They may they may be defenders of the ideas too.</p>
<p t="1747920" d="4480">But that doesn&#39;t mean they believe them.</p>
<p t="1752400" d="2680">You know, depending on how you define belief.</p>
<p t="1755080" d="500">SPEAKER: OK.</p>
<p t="1755580" d="2226">So this is the crux of it, I think.</p>
<p t="1757806" d="2624">It&#39;ll be a good launching point for the rest of the discussion.</p>
<p t="1760430" d="2560">So we&#39;re talking here a truth--</p>
<p t="1762990" d="4945">not a reinterpretation of truth from an objectivist, positivist, scientific</p>
<p t="1767935" d="2375">perspective, which we&#39;ve been hearing from the rationals.</p>
<p t="1770310" d="850">You&#39;re saying--</p>
<p t="1771160" d="2540">JORDAN PETERSON: It&#39;s a return to the original conceptions of truth.</p>
<p t="1773700" d="2960">SPEAKER: Right, along with the American pragmatist, and in light</p>
<p t="1776660" d="2880">of Darwinian insight into what life is.</p>
<p t="1779540" d="1750">JORDAN PETERSON: Well, you know, the thing</p>
<p t="1781290" d="3330">about the pragmatists, like I said, as soon as Darwin published</p>
<p t="1784620" d="3690">The Origin of Species, they recognized that the theory of evolution</p>
<p t="1788310" d="990">was pragmatic.</p>
<p t="1789300" d="1390">They got it like right now.</p>
<p t="1790690" d="2010">They were very excited about it.</p>
<p t="1792700" d="5510">So and they got excited about it because the Darwinian claim is things</p>
<p t="1798210" d="2370">are always true enough, and that&#39;s it.</p>
<p t="1800580" d="3980">And it isn&#39;t in some sense even because you lack knowledge.</p>
<p t="1804560" d="5200">It&#39;s because you couldn&#39;t have the knowledge, even hypothetically,</p>
<p t="1809760" d="4650">without running a simulation as complicated as the world itself.</p>
<p t="1814410" d="3010">And even then it wouldn&#39;t turn out the same way.</p>
<p t="1817420" d="2950">SPEAKER: So is this like a Godelian view of reality,</p>
<p t="1820370" d="4780">in the sense that any explanation of the complexity of the system</p>
<p t="1825150" d="3085">is doomed to be simpler than the system is trying to explain.</p>
<p t="1828235" d="875">JORDAN PETERSON: Yes.</p>
<p t="1829110" d="1310">That&#39;s one way of thinking about it.</p>
<p t="1830420" d="490">Sure.</p>
<p t="1830910" d="360">Sure.</p>
<p t="1831270" d="2291">Well, yeah, you could think about it as-- that&#39;s right,</p>
<p t="1833561" d="4609">you can think about it as a limitation of the perceiver.</p>
<p t="1838170" d="2440">The problem too is that whatever knowledge you accrue</p>
<p t="1840610" d="3080">about the system changes the system.</p>
<p t="1843690" d="3640">It&#39;s like trying to predict the stock market, which isn&#39;t possible.</p>
<p t="1847330" d="530">Right?</p>
<p t="1847860" d="3190">So I think that&#39;s a really good example, actually.</p>
<p t="1851050" d="3350">And you know, try to predict the stock market rationally.</p>
<p t="1854400" d="692">See how you do.</p>
<p t="1855092" d="1708">Well, you might say, well, it&#39;s not real.</p>
<p t="1856800" d="1220">It&#39;s like, OK.</p>
<p t="1858020" d="3160">Well, we don&#39;t agree about what constitutes real.</p>
<p t="1861180" d="2030">So we can have that discussion.</p>
<p t="1863210" d="1750">SPEAKER: It sounds like what you&#39;re saying</p>
<p t="1864960" d="6890">is the truth is as much about action as it</p>
<p t="1871850" d="4890">is about some sort of material, measurable objective reality.</p>
<p t="1876740" d="2327">JORDAN PETERSON: No, I&#39;m saying it&#39;s more about action.</p>
<p t="1879067" d="583">SPEAKER: More.</p>
<p t="1879650" d="1250">JORDAN PETERSON: Oh, yes, yes.</p>
<p t="1880900" d="3760">The fundamentals of truth are those that guide action.</p>
<p t="1884660" d="3390">And then the object of science is nested inside that.</p>
<p t="1888050" d="990">It has to be.</p>
<p t="1889040" d="1150">There&#39;s no way around that.</p>
<p t="1890190" d="500">SPEAKER: OK.</p>
<p t="1890690" d="2820">So that is really central because everything--</p>
<p t="1893510" d="3060">in my mind-- everything in Maps of Meaning and a lot of your other work</p>
<p t="1896570" d="810">flows from there.</p>
<p t="1897380" d="2070">It&#39;s a different way.</p>
<p t="1899450" d="1084">It&#39;s a different priority.</p>
<p t="1900534" d="1249">JORDAN PETERSON: That&#39;s right.</p>
<p t="1901783" d="567">That&#39;s right.</p>
<p t="1902350" d="1120">SPEAKER: Maybe we can elaborate that a little bit.</p>
<p t="1903470" d="2250">JORDAN PETERSON: OK, well, we could do that Darwinian.</p>
<p t="1905720" d="2000">And let&#39;s do it from a Darwinian perspective.</p>
<p t="1907720" d="910">OK.</p>
<p t="1908630" d="5250">So first of all, there&#39;s the single celled animals.</p>
<p t="1913880" d="2380">We&#39;ll say, well, we don&#39;t have to talk about them.</p>
<p t="1916260" d="2420">What we&#39;re going to start to talk about is</p>
<p t="1918680" d="4320">animals that have a complex, a sufficiently complex nervous system</p>
<p t="1923000" d="4620">to have to respond to the social environment, which would be made out</p>
<p t="1927620" d="1860">of conspecifics often.</p>
<p t="1929480" d="3970">So lobsters are a perfectly good place to start.</p>
<p t="1933450" d="3290">It&#39;s like, once lobster--</p>
<p t="1936740" d="2400">there&#39;s a lobster and then there&#39;s another lobster.</p>
<p t="1939140" d="1260">And maybe they&#39;re alone.</p>
<p t="1940400" d="4140">Well, then they only have to solve the problem of being one lobster.</p>
<p t="1944540" d="1800">But then as soon as you put them together,</p>
<p t="1946340" d="3760">they have to solve the problem of being two lobsters in the same space.</p>
<p t="1950100" d="2400">And then maybe there&#39;s 100 lobsters in the same space.</p>
<p t="1952500" d="4280">So then the question becomes how do you organize lobster behavior</p>
<p t="1956780" d="4350">when most of the environment consists of other lobsters behaving?</p>
<p t="1961130" d="3870">And the answer to that has been you put it-- you make a dominance hierarchy.</p>
<p t="1965000" d="4590">And then the dominance hierarchy--</p>
<p t="1969590" d="2700">the way you adapt to the dominance hierarchy</p>
<p t="1972290" d="4470">is by noting the patterns of behavior that compose it,</p>
<p t="1976760" d="4500">and by first internalizing those.</p>
<p t="1981260" d="3570">Let&#39;s say, modeling them-- to the degree that that&#39;s possible.</p>
<p t="1984830" d="5700">But even more remarkably, over huge expanses of time,</p>
<p t="1990530" d="2760">because the dominance hierarchy and its patterns</p>
<p t="1993290" d="2190">are a fundamental element of reality, you</p>
<p t="1995480" d="3950">start to adapt biologically to the dominance hierarchy.</p>
<p t="1999430" d="820">So OK.</p>
<p t="2000250" d="5590">So now what we&#39;ve got is we&#39;ve got an emergent set of social behaviors.</p>
<p t="2005840" d="500">OK.</p>
<p t="2006340" d="3360">They&#39;re not rules because they&#39;re not rules till you observe them,</p>
<p t="2009700" d="2850">or till you codify them, or til you articulate them.</p>
<p t="2012550" d="6000">What they are is the patterns from which rules emerge.</p>
<p t="2018550" d="2070">And they are deep patterns.</p>
<p t="2020620" d="2520">So then you might say, OK, what are the rules</p>
<p t="2023140" d="2490">for staying alive in a dominance hierarchy,</p>
<p t="2025630" d="2430">not being torn apart by your conspecifics.</p>
<p t="2028060" d="3810">And that&#39;s learning quickly who can tear you into pieces</p>
<p t="2031870" d="2850">and who can&#39;t, and learning how to get away</p>
<p t="2034720" d="2430">from the thing that can tear you into pieces quickly,</p>
<p t="2037150" d="2820">and learning how to push the thing that can&#39;t aside.</p>
<p t="2039970" d="1710">And you&#39;d better learn that fast.</p>
<p t="2041680" d="3840">And you want to learn it with the minimum possible amount of damage</p>
<p t="2045520" d="2707">because that&#39;s another problem that social creatures have,</p>
<p t="2048227" d="2333">or at least creatures that are in a dominance hierarchy.</p>
<p t="2050560" d="3041">It gets even more complicated when the members of the dominance hierarchy</p>
<p t="2053601" d="1549">start to cooperate.</p>
<p t="2055150" d="1970">But lobsters, as far as we know--</p>
<p t="2057120" d="2380">as far as I know-- don&#39;t cooperate.</p>
<p t="2059500" d="4110">But still, like, their behavior is very, very determined</p>
<p t="2063610" d="2501">by the nature of the dominance hierarchy.</p>
<p t="2066111" d="499">OK.</p>
<p t="2066610" d="4620">So what that is the patterns that govern a dominance hierarchy are</p>
<p t="2071230" d="4009">the place from which ethics derive.</p>
<p t="2075239" d="511">Right?</p>
<p t="2075750" d="2320">And they evolved.</p>
<p t="2078070" d="1550">And they&#39;re not arbitrary.</p>
<p t="2079620" d="1050">That&#39;s the other thing.</p>
<p t="2080670" d="3239">What works in one dominance hierarchy works in another.</p>
<p t="2083909" d="2431">And so you might say, well, what&#39;s your proof for that?</p>
<p t="2086340" d="2640">And why would say, well, one of my proofs for that</p>
<p t="2088980" d="7350">is that we use the same brain chemical and the same neurological system,</p>
<p t="2096330" d="4050">roughly speaking, to keep track of our position in the dominant hierarchy</p>
<p t="2100380" d="1350">as lobsters do.</p>
<p t="2101730" d="4230">And that&#39;s 300 million years of continuity.</p>
<p t="2105960" d="5950">So that&#39;s real enough as far as I&#39;m concerned.</p>
<p t="2111910" d="500">OK.</p>
<p t="2112410" d="3210">So now you&#39;ve got your lobsters, and find they organize themselves</p>
<p t="2115620" d="1060">according to these rules.</p>
<p t="2116680" d="4490">And the top lobster is confident and makes himself big.</p>
<p t="2121170" d="2730">And he&#39;s the one that gets all the chicks.</p>
<p t="2123900" d="4650">So your success in the dominance hierarchy, especially if you&#39;re male,</p>
<p t="2128550" d="3390">also determines the probability of your reproduction.</p>
<p t="2131940" d="2740">And it may determine that more than anything else.</p>
<p t="2134680" d="2450">So how to maneuver in the dominance hierarchy</p>
<p t="2137130" d="4770">might be the prime question that faces creatures</p>
<p t="2141900" d="2310">that have to live with conspecifics.</p>
<p t="2144210" d="3540">And the females, in some sense, use the dominant hierarchy</p>
<p t="2147750" d="6120">as a distributed computational device to determine the worth of the males.</p>
<p t="2153870" d="3060">So because what the females do is they sort of hang off to the side,</p>
<p t="2156930" d="1630">and they watch the males battle it out.</p>
<p t="2158560" d="1550">And then they just pick from the top.</p>
<p t="2160110" d="1980">Now, they have their own hierarchy.</p>
<p t="2162090" d="2450">And you know, it runs by somewhat different rules.</p>
<p t="2164540" d="1300">But it&#39;s very smart.</p>
<p t="2165840" d="3145">It&#39;s-- they&#39;re externalizing the cognitive problem to the structure</p>
<p t="2168985" d="500">itself.</p>
<p t="2173505" d="2125">So then there&#39;s the rules that govern the dominance</p>
<p t="2175630" d="3610">hierarchy, the simple one, which is just where they are the same animals,</p>
<p t="2179240" d="1100">but they&#39;re competing.</p>
<p t="2180340" d="3510">But then, when you get a little farther along, you know, maybe</p>
<p t="2183850" d="4500">to the point where animals are hunting together, that might be it,</p>
<p t="2188350" d="2640">or caretaking, something like that, anyways,</p>
<p t="2190990" d="2040">where cooperative behavior emerges.</p>
<p t="2193030" d="4530">OK, now a different rule start to apply because--</p>
<p t="2197560" d="2580">like in a wolf pack, let&#39;s say.</p>
<p t="2200140" d="3090">The wolf still wants to get to the top, but he</p>
<p t="2203230" d="2910">doesn&#39;t want to tear every one to pieces as he climbs to the top</p>
<p t="2206140" d="2820">because if he did that, then he won&#39;t be in a pack.</p>
<p t="2208960" d="1800">And then that&#39;s not going to work.</p>
<p t="2210760" d="1250">He&#39;s going to starve to death.</p>
<p t="2212010" d="1990">So that really gets complicated.</p>
<p t="2214000" d="7130">It&#39;s like, you can defeat someone, but you can&#39;t destroy them.</p>
<p t="2221130" d="500">OK.</p>
<p t="2221630" d="1890">There&#39;s another more rule.</p>
<p t="2223520" d="2670">You can defeat someone, but you can&#39;t destroy them.</p>
<p t="2226190" d="4230">So you might say, well, that&#39;s a rule that emerges spontaneously</p>
<p t="2230420" d="3810">as a consequence of social interactions under biological control.</p>
<p t="2234230" d="5430">And once the rule emerges, the dominance hierarchy</p>
<p t="2239660" d="2460">lasts long enough so evolutionary pressure</p>
<p t="2242120" d="5480">can start to operate to ensure that creatures within that system</p>
<p t="2247600" d="4170">build their ability to follow that rule into their nervous systems.</p>
<p t="2251770" d="5430">Because it&#39;s the main selection force, whether they&#39;re successful at it.</p>
<p t="2257200" d="4510">So what seems to be arbitrary and social can become built in</p>
<p t="2261710" d="2900">and biological I think faster than we understand</p>
<p t="2264610" d="4020">because the consequences of being victorious in the dominance hierarchy</p>
<p t="2268630" d="1440">are so high.</p>
<p t="2270070" d="5330">So in the wolf hierarchy it&#39;s sort of like--</p>
<p t="2275400" d="1650">we got to hunt together.</p>
<p t="2277050" d="2720">We&#39;re going to have disputes about who&#39;s boss.</p>
<p t="2279770" d="2970">We&#39;ll settle the dispute symbolically, fundamentally, right?</p>
<p t="2282740" d="750">I&#39;ll threaten you.</p>
<p t="2283490" d="1055">You threaten me.</p>
<p t="2284545" d="875">One of us will blink.</p>
<p t="2285420" d="3360">The guy that blinks rolls over, shows his throat.</p>
<p t="2288780" d="1260">You pretend to rip it out.</p>
<p t="2290040" d="960">But you don&#39;t.</p>
<p t="2291000" d="4340">And we accept that as a proxy for battle.</p>
<p t="2295340" d="2709">SPEAKER: You&#39;re making the case that wolves operate symbolically?</p>
<p t="2298049" d="832">JORDAN PETERSON: No.</p>
<p t="2298881" d="579">Not at all.</p>
<p t="2299460" d="2970">It&#39;s just-- it&#39;s coded in their behavior.</p>
<p t="2302430" d="500">Yeah.</p>
<p t="2302930" d="500">Yeah.</p>
<p t="2303430" d="5630">You have to make a real distinction between patterns of action and rules.</p>
<p t="2309060" d="1340">They&#39;re not the same thing.</p>
<p t="2310400" d="4000">Because we like to think that well, if you see regularities in an animal&#39;s</p>
<p t="2314400" d="1710">behavior, it&#39;s following rules.</p>
<p t="2316110" d="510">No.</p>
<p t="2316620" d="2320">It&#39;s as if it&#39;s following rules.</p>
<p t="2318940" d="3744">SPEAKER: Doesn&#39;t in an anthropomorhpizing assumption.</p>
<p t="2322684" d="916">JORDAN PETERSON: Well.</p>
<p t="2323600" d="3670">So, it&#39;s also a different-- it&#39;s also a different-- it&#39;s a level of abstraction</p>
<p t="2327270" d="780">above.</p>
<p t="2328050" d="2400">First, it&#39;s the pattern of behavior.</p>
<p t="2330450" d="2470">Then, if you observe the pattern of behavior,</p>
<p t="2332920" d="3410">and you have the capacity to make symbolic representations,</p>
<p t="2336330" d="2340">then you can make the symbolic representation.</p>
<p t="2338670" d="2910">And those would emerge first in image, not in words.</p>
<p t="2341580" d="1230">Image.</p>
<p t="2342810" d="1800">Image and stories.</p>
<p t="2344610" d="600">Right?</p>
<p t="2345210" d="3000">So that&#39;s like the dramatic substrates behavior.</p>
<p t="2348210" d="1890">And then it&#39;s behavior imitating behavior.</p>
<p t="2350100" d="1170">That&#39;s drama.</p>
<p t="2351270" d="3060">That&#39;s like a Piagetian idea, you know, that you can use your body</p>
<p t="2354330" d="1620">as a representational structure.</p>
<p t="2355950" d="1530">That&#39;s what human beings can do.</p>
<p t="2357480" d="1710">That&#39;s what imitation is.</p>
<p t="2359190" d="2110">It&#39;s a big deal.</p>
<p t="2361300" d="930">So OK.</p>
<p t="2362230" d="1080">So you&#39;ve got the wolves.</p>
<p t="2363310" d="1230">And it&#39;s sort of like--</p>
<p t="2364540" d="1400">SPEAKER: And so, this is great.</p>
<p t="2365940" d="5620">So it sounds like the argument is building from lobsters to--</p>
<p t="2371560" d="1980">and this is this is how I&#39;m interpreting it--</p>
<p t="2373540" d="7150">from lobsters to a strong argument for essentially why union archetypes</p>
<p t="2380690" d="570">actually--</p>
<p t="2381260" d="395">JORDAN PETERSON: Absolutely.</p>
<p t="2381655" d="1175">SPEAKER: As things.</p>
<p t="2382830" d="500">Which is--</p>
<p t="2383330" d="810">JORDAN PETERSON: Yes, well this is--</p>
<p t="2384140" d="1120">SPEAKER: Very important.</p>
<p t="2385260" d="2060">However, what I think is also important is</p>
<p t="2387320" d="5010">to help viewers understand how we get from lobsters and dominance hierarchies</p>
<p t="2392330" d="1117">to truth.</p>
<p t="2393447" d="833">JORDAN PETERSON: OK.</p>
<p t="2394280" d="2390">So they&#39;re not things.</p>
<p t="2396670" d="2930">They&#39;re constituent elements of reality.</p>
<p t="2399600" d="1190">That&#39;s not the same thing.</p>
<p t="2400790" d="660">OK.</p>
<p t="2401450" d="4710">And a constituent element of reality is in some sense--</p>
<p t="2406160" d="1500">depends on the thing--</p>
<p t="2407660" d="4750">but it&#39;s longevity is sufficient to make it more than merely a thing.</p>
<p t="2412410" d="1790">Thing is a kind of temporary.</p>
<p t="2414200" d="1500">I mean, protons aren&#39;t.</p>
<p t="2415700" d="2190">But, you know, things are temporary.</p>
<p t="2417890" d="2580">Dominance hierarchies, those are not temporary.</p>
<p t="2420470" d="1760">Those are eternal.</p>
<p t="2422230" d="2890">They&#39;re eternal as far as we&#39;re concerned.</p>
<p t="2425120" d="700">OK.</p>
<p t="2425820" d="2000">So you got the wolf.</p>
<p t="2427820" d="3120">And then you think, well, what kind of wolf gets to the top?</p>
<p t="2430940" d="3260">And you might think, the toughest wolf.</p>
<p t="2434200" d="2610">That&#39;s sort of like the cave man theory, you know.</p>
<p t="2436810" d="3420">But it&#39;s unlikely that it&#39;s the toughest wolf.</p>
<p t="2440230" d="4950">It&#39;s a wolf that&#39;s well-adapted across multiple dimensions.</p>
<p t="2445180" d="3630">But the wolf that&#39;s successful in the dominance hierarchy,</p>
<p t="2448810" d="4170">you could think of as the archetypal wolf.</p>
<p t="2452980" d="2150">Now, what kind of wolf is that?</p>
<p t="2455130" d="2190">Well, I don&#39;t know enough about wolves to know.</p>
<p t="2457320" d="2370">But I do know some things about dogs.</p>
<p t="2459690" d="4480">I mean, a dog is co-operative as well as competitive.</p>
<p t="2464170" d="3030">And it&#39;s pretty sophisticated at picking up</p>
<p t="2467200" d="2696">the cues that indicate the nature of social relationships.</p>
<p t="2469896" d="1624">Like it can do that in a human society.</p>
<p t="2471520" d="2160">The dog doesn&#39;t know the rules.</p>
<p t="2473680" d="4710">But the dog has the morality of the dominant system already built into it.</p>
<p t="2478390" d="3640">So it&#39;s a predicate of it&#39;s biological existence.</p>
<p t="2482030" d="500">OK.</p>
<p t="2482530" d="6290">So we&#39;ll switch to chimps because you can actually talk a little bit more--</p>
<p t="2488820" d="3060">with a little bit more concrete knowledge about which chimps win--</p>
<p t="2491880" d="1950">this is a lot from Frans de Waal--</p>
<p t="2496380" d="1710">which chimps stays on top.</p>
<p t="2498090" d="2460">Because male chimps make a pretty vicious hierarchy, right?</p>
<p t="2500550" d="2530">And it&#39;s almost always a male on top.</p>
<p t="2503080" d="1880">It&#39;s not so clear with bonobos, but--</p>
<p t="2504960" d="3650">or bonobos, I never know how to say that--</p>
<p t="2508610" d="5050">but the chimp that stays on top-- brutal chimps can rule for a while.</p>
<p t="2513660" d="3540">But because they&#39;re brutal, they&#39;re not very good at making coalitions.</p>
<p t="2517200" d="2460">And even if you&#39;re brutal and strong, two guys</p>
<p t="2519660" d="3900">that are half as brutal as you, and 3/4 as strong will take you down.</p>
<p t="2523560" d="1650">And that&#39;s what the chimps do.</p>
<p t="2525210" d="5160">So then you might say, well, in order to be optimally situated</p>
<p t="2530370" d="2982">for maximum reproductive potential, not only do</p>
<p t="2533352" d="2208">you want to climb the hierarchy, you want to climb it</p>
<p t="2535560" d="1840">without being hurt too much.</p>
<p t="2537400" d="3290">You don&#39;t want to blow the straps out of your group.</p>
<p t="2540690" d="1980">And you want to stay there as long as possible.</p>
<p t="2542670" d="500">OK.</p>
<p t="2543170" d="1102">So that&#39;s a niche.</p>
<p t="2544272" d="708">Think about that.</p>
<p t="2544980" d="960">That&#39;s a niche.</p>
<p t="2545940" d="4020">It&#39;s complicated because the niche involves success in climbing,</p>
<p t="2549960" d="4800">and then it involves success in maintaining an uppermost position.</p>
<p t="2554760" d="1640">OK.</p>
<p t="2556400" d="3730">And that, for chimps, that requires not only the capacity to be aggressive,</p>
<p t="2560130" d="4260">but also the capacity to be co-operative and empathic.</p>
<p t="2564390" d="2280">So one of the things de Waall discovered, for example,</p>
<p t="2566670" d="5450">is that the chimp who stays on top, first of all, can make coalitions.</p>
<p t="2572120" d="2140">So there&#39;s a lot of reciprocal grooming and so on.</p>
<p t="2574260" d="4080">So he can make friends, even though he&#39;s kind of-- you know, he&#39;s tough.</p>
<p t="2578340" d="2130">But he also pays a lot of attention to the females</p>
<p t="2580470" d="2760">and the infants in the troop.</p>
<p t="2583230" d="4110">So whatever constitutes sovereignty, let&#39;s say, from a chimp perspective,</p>
<p t="2587340" d="2680">is a lot more complex than mere power.</p>
<p t="2590020" d="500">OK.</p>
<p t="2590520" d="480">So fine.</p>
<p t="2591000" d="720">So that&#39;s chimps.</p>
<p t="2591720" d="810">Now, we&#39;re chimps.</p>
<p t="2592530" d="4170">So you already got the origin of human ethics to some degree in that.</p>
<p t="2596700" d="3420">It&#39;s like, get to the top, but don&#39;t be too much of a prick</p>
<p t="2600120" d="3870">when you&#39;re there, so to speak, right?</p>
<p t="2603990" d="4335">You have to rule while making allowances for those--</p>
<p t="2610830" d="4800">and make allowances for the fact that those you rule over have value.</p>
<p t="2615630" d="3120">Now, that&#39;s an interesting thing because now what you&#39;ve done</p>
<p t="2618750" d="3870">is if you&#39;ve introduced the-- not the idea, but the fact</p>
<p t="2622620" d="5200">that even a defeated other is a valuable part of the group.</p>
<p t="2627820" d="500">OK.</p>
<p t="2628320" d="3320">Now, that&#39;s starting to get morality there, started to get fairly deep</p>
<p t="2631640" d="3820">because that&#39;s kind of like, well, the outcast still has value.</p>
<p t="2635460" d="1500">OK.</p>
<p t="2636960" d="3030">Now, you come to human beings and you think, OK, well, what&#39;s--</p>
<p t="2639990" d="3240">what makes a human being successful in the dominance hierarchy?</p>
<p t="2643230" d="2870">You can say, well, it&#39;s the same thing the chimps have.</p>
<p t="2646100" d="6900">And that&#39;s right, except that human beings have one other thing, at least.</p>
<p t="2653000" d="2340">They can make new dominance hierarchy.</p>
<p t="2655340" d="1650">That&#39;s what creativity is, right?</p>
<p t="2656990" d="3611">So you invent a new something, and you can erect a dominance hierarchy</p>
<p t="2660601" d="499">around it.</p>
<p t="2661100" d="2970">So if you can&#39;t climb the dominant hierarchy that&#39;s already here,</p>
<p t="2664070" d="1860">you can just say well, here&#39;s a new thing,</p>
<p t="2665930" d="2410">and we&#39;ll make it a little dominant hierarchy over there.</p>
<p t="2668340" d="2930">So now you&#39;ve got the addition of the capacity</p>
<p t="2671270" d="4080">to transform the dominance hierarchy as another thing that&#39;s contributing</p>
<p t="2675350" d="2110">to dominance hierarchy success.</p>
<p t="2677460" d="500">OK.</p>
<p t="2677960" d="5910">So I believe that what&#39;s come out of that is the idea that--</p>
<p t="2683870" d="4570">this is such a great idea-- is that the top of the dominance hierarchy</p>
<p t="2688440" d="2120">is the right place to be.</p>
<p t="2690560" d="4490">But the top of all potential sets of dominance hierarchies</p>
<p t="2695050" d="2100">is a better place to be.</p>
<p t="2697150" d="5950">And I think we&#39;re selected to be the top of the set of potential dominance</p>
<p t="2703100" d="914">hierarchies.</p>
<p t="2704014" d="2166">And that means, in some sense, if you&#39;re at the top,</p>
<p t="2706180" d="3600">you&#39;re not at the top of a dominance hierarchy.</p>
<p t="2709780" d="1091">You&#39;re at the top of--</p>
<p t="2710871" d="499">OK.</p>
<p t="2711370" d="990">So now imagine this.</p>
<p t="2712360" d="2471">So now imagine a landscape.</p>
<p t="2714831" d="499">OK.</p>
<p t="2715330" d="2460">As far as you can see it&#39;s a plane.</p>
<p t="2717790" d="3090">And there&#39;s pyramids all over it of different sizes, right?</p>
<p t="2720880" d="2110">And you&#39;re flying above it.</p>
<p t="2722990" d="1790">You zoom in to a pyramid.</p>
<p t="2724780" d="3120">And you see all people packed inside, trying to climb to the top.</p>
<p t="2727900" d="2700">But there&#39;s pyramids everywhere where people are doing this.</p>
<p t="2730600" d="3170">But you&#39;re flying along the top.</p>
<p t="2733770" d="6310">OK, well, that&#39;s-- as far as I can tell-- that&#39;s the Egyptian god Horus.</p>
<p t="2740080" d="1890">Horus isn&#39;t in the pyramid.</p>
<p t="2741970" d="2530">He&#39;s above the pyramid.</p>
<p t="2744500" d="3050">And he&#39;s the Eye, because Horus is the Eye.</p>
<p t="2747550" d="1980">And so Horus stands for attention.</p>
<p t="2749530" d="2310">And so there&#39;s this idea that the Egyptians</p>
<p t="2751840" d="5130">start to play with that one of the most important gods is Osiris.</p>
<p t="2756970" d="1740">And he&#39;s like god of the pyramid.</p>
<p t="2758710" d="3930">He stands for security and stability and the past.</p>
<p t="2762640" d="2700">But he can be wiped out by various means.</p>
<p t="2765340" d="3594">So he&#39;s not permanent enough in some sense, or he lacks something.</p>
<p t="2768934" d="1791">SPEAKER: The father archetype, essentially?</p>
<p t="2770725" d="165">JORDAN PETERSON: Yes.</p>
<p t="2770890" d="2550">So Osiris is the father, yeah, the Great Father.</p>
<p t="2773440" d="2280">It&#39;s half of the archetype because he&#39;s the po--</p>
<p t="2775720" d="2840">he&#39;s the positive element of the Great Father.</p>
<p t="2778560" d="1750">He&#39;s not the negative element, although he</p>
<p t="2780310" d="2580">makes himself susceptible to the negative element</p>
<p t="2782890" d="2170">by being willfully blind.</p>
<p t="2785060" d="500">OK.</p>
<p t="2785560" d="1230">So his son is Horus.</p>
<p t="2786790" d="1010">And Horus is the Eye.</p>
<p t="2787800" d="1390">Horus pays attention.</p>
<p t="2789190" d="4890">So the Egyptians are starting to get the idea that well, you should be Osiris.</p>
<p t="2794080" d="2940">That means you are the embodiment of the dominance hierarchy, say.</p>
<p t="2797020" d="3420">But you also should be Horus, which is the thing that pays attention,</p>
<p t="2800440" d="3480">because the dominance hierarchy as it&#39;s currently structured</p>
<p t="2803920" d="2170">may be restructured.</p>
<p t="2806090" d="3920">And then-- so you don&#39;t want to just be adapted to this dominance hierarchy,</p>
<p t="2810010" d="2490">you want to be adapted so if it transforms</p>
<p t="2812500" d="5520">its structure, that&#39;s no problem for you because you&#39;re not stuck in it.</p>
<p t="2818020" d="2364">You&#39;re in it and not in it at the same time.</p>
<p t="2820384" d="2166">And that&#39;s the big contribution of Egyptian thought.</p>
<p t="2822550" d="2550">I think it&#39;s brilliant, brilliant.</p>
<p t="2825100" d="2210">SPEAKER: We can-- just a slight tangent from that.</p>
<p t="2827310" d="3190">So what you&#39;re talking about here is-- just to make the distinction clear</p>
<p t="2830500" d="1630">for other people--</p>
<p t="2832130" d="3220">when the Egyptians are experimenting with these ideas and representing them</p>
<p t="2835350" d="4000">in imagistic form or in hieroglyphic form,</p>
<p t="2839350" d="2730">are you saying that they&#39;re doing this consciously, or this is--</p>
<p t="2842080" d="5366">this is like some sort of natural--</p>
<p t="2847446" d="1624">JORDAN PETERSON: Happens automatically.</p>
<p t="2849070" d="1260">SPEAKER: Next level of representation.</p>
<p t="2850330" d="330">JORDAN PETERSON: Yeah.</p>
<p t="2850660" d="1320">Well, think about it this way.</p>
<p t="2851980" d="3252">So imagine that one of the things that characterize whether or not</p>
<p t="2855232" d="2208">you can climb the dominance hierarchy is how good you</p>
<p t="2857440" d="3671">are at watching people who can climb the dominance hierarchy and imitating them.</p>
<p t="2861111" d="499">OK.</p>
<p t="2861610" d="3250">So that means that part of it&#39;s going to be built in your biology</p>
<p t="2864860" d="2225">because you&#39;ve been-- the dominance hierarchy has</p>
<p t="2867085" d="1665">been working on you for a long time.</p>
<p t="2868750" d="3990">So you have the capability of being the thing that can climb.</p>
<p t="2872740" d="3840">But then, let&#39;s say you get an edge by watching someone who&#39;s successfully</p>
<p t="2876580" d="3870">climbing because they&#39;re adapted to the current circumstances precisely.</p>
<p t="2880450" d="1121">And you can imitate them.</p>
<p t="2881571" d="499">OK.</p>
<p t="2882070" d="4280">Then the question is, well, what does it mean to imitate them?</p>
<p t="2886350" d="3870">And what it means is you can model their behavior with your behavior.</p>
<p t="2890220" d="570">OK.</p>
<p t="2890790" d="3040">So that&#39;s a form of representation.</p>
<p t="2893830" d="500">OK.</p>
<p t="2894330" d="1470">Now you&#39;ve got it.</p>
<p t="2895800" d="2340">Now, we&#39;re all watching each other.</p>
<p t="2898140" d="1735">And we find those people who can climb up</p>
<p t="2899875" d="1625">dominance hierarchies very interesting.</p>
<p t="2901500" d="2340">So we tell-- we start to tell stories about them,</p>
<p t="2903840" d="4860">which is the representation of behavior in image and articulation.</p>
<p t="2908700" d="5190">So it&#39;s like, you tell the story about some interesting person</p>
<p t="2913890" d="987">that you admire.</p>
<p t="2914877" d="2583">And then it&#39;s a pretty good story so other people remember it.</p>
<p t="2917460" d="2597">But then it sort of gets commingled in with some other stories</p>
<p t="2920057" d="2833">about some interesting people who can climb the dominance hierarchy.</p>
<p t="2922890" d="1740">And then thousands of you gather.</p>
<p t="2924630" d="3210">And those stories all have a war over centuries.</p>
<p t="2927840" d="3270">And what you extract out of it is like the most interesting person</p>
<p t="2931110" d="2550">who&#39;s the best at climbing the dominance hierarchy.</p>
<p t="2933660" d="2760">And that&#39;s where you start to get the idea of the Savior.</p>
<p t="2936420" d="2490">And so it&#39;s a bottom up process.</p>
<p t="2938910" d="4290">And so-- and then once that&#39;s once you&#39;ve started to get that, well,</p>
<p t="2943200" d="2850">then the process can be more than merely--</p>
<p t="2951400" d="2820">you can start to understand and model, in some sense,</p>
<p t="2954220" d="4580">what the principles are that govern success.</p>
<p t="2958800" d="1790">But it&#39;s a universal success, right?</p>
<p t="2960590" d="1870">It&#39;s not success in a given hierarchy.</p>
<p t="2962460" d="3799">It&#39;s like, what are the principles that guarantee universal success?</p>
<p t="2966259" d="2541">So you might say, well, that&#39;s the ultimate question of life.</p>
<p t="2968800" d="2900">It&#39;s like, yes, that is the ultimate question of life.</p>
<p t="2971700" d="2070">So what did the Egyptians figure out?</p>
<p t="2973770" d="4650">Well, they figured out that Osiris was a good guy.</p>
<p t="2978420" d="1710">You need him.</p>
<p t="2980130" d="3600">But he&#39;s kind of blind because he&#39;s old.</p>
<p t="2983730" d="2760">And he&#39;s willfully blind too.</p>
<p t="2986490" d="3450">And that makes him susceptible to the forces that</p>
<p t="2989940" d="4285">want to overturn the hierarchy, but the negative forces, the ones that</p>
<p t="2994225" d="875">just want to destroy.</p>
<p t="2995100" d="1630">That&#39;s his brother Seth.</p>
<p t="2996730" d="5000">So Osiris remains willfully blind and he let Seth basically chop him into pieces</p>
<p t="3001730" d="2100">and distribute him throughout the Egyptian state.</p>
<p t="3003830" d="1350">So things fall apart.</p>
<p t="3005180" d="780">And Seth rules.</p>
<p t="3005960" d="2370">So the Egyptians had already figured out in models</p>
<p t="3008330" d="5896">that the hierarchy can become probably corrupted by power and deceit,</p>
<p t="3014226" d="1124">something like that, right?</p>
<p t="3015350" d="3540">So it&#39;s no longer functioning as it should.</p>
<p t="3018890" d="2156">And it can continually do that.</p>
<p t="3021046" d="2624">SPEAKER: Is that a descent into chaos, or that&#39;s just sort of--</p>
<p t="3023670" d="320">JORDAN PETERSON: Yeah.</p>
<p t="3023990" d="500">Yeah.</p>
<p t="3024490" d="1984">Well, it&#39;s that it&#39;s the demolition of order.</p>
<p t="3026474" d="2166">And well, then that&#39;s when Isis makes her appearance</p>
<p t="3028640" d="1330">because she&#39;s goddess of chaos.</p>
<p t="3029970" d="1760">It&#39;s like up comes Isis.</p>
<p t="3031730" d="1710">And her husband is Osiris.</p>
<p t="3033440" d="1320">And he&#39;s all chopped up.</p>
<p t="3034760" d="1980">So she goes around Egypt.</p>
<p t="3036740" d="1890">He&#39;s not killed because he can&#39;t kill Osiris</p>
<p t="3038630" d="1374">because he&#39;s dominance hierarchy.</p>
<p t="3040004" d="876">You can disrupt it.</p>
<p t="3040880" d="1270">You can break it into pieces.</p>
<p t="3042150" d="2360">But it&#39;s going to come back together.</p>
<p t="3044510" d="4440">So Isis wanders around Egypt trying to find his phallus.</p>
<p t="3048950" d="1080">So she finally does.</p>
<p t="3050030" d="1840">And she makes herself pregnant with it.</p>
<p t="3051870" d="3770">And so the idea there is that when the pieces of society fall into chaos,</p>
<p t="3055640" d="1410">they&#39;re still alive.</p>
<p t="3057050" d="2340">So something new can be born out of them, right?</p>
<p t="3059390" d="3300">It&#39;s like the creative destruction that the economists talk about.</p>
<p t="3062690" d="1350">Isis makes herself pregnant.</p>
<p t="3064040" d="1800">She gives birth to Horus.</p>
<p t="3065840" d="5580">Now, Horus is Osiris&#39; son, but the big difference between him and Osiris</p>
<p t="3071420" d="1500">is that he can see.</p>
<p t="3072920" d="1650">He&#39;s not willfully blind.</p>
<p t="3074570" d="2580">In fact, he&#39;s the opposite of willfully blind.</p>
<p t="3077150" d="3540">He&#39;s almost only the Eye, the famous Egyptian Eye.</p>
<p t="3080690" d="1530">He&#39;s also a falcon.</p>
<p t="3082220" d="1920">And falcons are those things that fly above.</p>
<p t="3084140" d="2970">And they can really, really, really see.</p>
<p t="3087110" d="2925">So Horus grows up outside the kingdom.</p>
<p t="3090035" d="1095">Well, why?</p>
<p t="3091130" d="3030">Everybody grows up outside the kingdom because the Old Kingdom</p>
<p t="3094160" d="3750">is always corrupt and archaic and willfully blind.</p>
<p t="3097910" d="1500">So you&#39;re always alienated from it.</p>
<p t="3099410" d="3360">So alienation is like a permanent element of being.</p>
<p t="3102770" d="4230">But then Horus goes, and because he can see, he sees Seth for who he is.</p>
<p t="3107000" d="2310">And then he has a horrible fight with Seth.</p>
<p t="3109310" d="2280">And he wins.</p>
<p t="3111590" d="1610">And then he banishes Seth.</p>
<p t="3113200" d="2080">Now, you can&#39;t kill him because he&#39;s Seth.</p>
<p t="3115280" d="3930">It&#39;s like, the fact that dominance hierarchies can become corrupt</p>
<p t="3119210" d="1104">is an eternal fact.</p>
<p t="3120314" d="1416">So there&#39;s no getting rid of Seth.</p>
<p t="3121730" d="2130">But you can get rid of him temporarily.</p>
<p t="3123860" d="3180">So when he gets rid of him, he steals his eye back.</p>
<p t="3127040" d="2620">And then you think, OK, well, he&#39;s got rid of Seth.</p>
<p t="3129660" d="1460">It&#39;s like, he&#39;s got the kingdom.</p>
<p t="3131120" d="660">End of story.</p>
<p t="3131780" d="2520">But that is what happens.</p>
<p t="3134300" d="4320">Horus takes his eye, and goes back down to chaos, in the underworld,</p>
<p t="3138620" d="4020">and he finds Osiris down there, who&#39;s sort of like, you know, he&#39;s a ghost.</p>
<p t="3142640" d="1950">Is a shade of his former self.</p>
<p t="3144590" d="2160">And Horus gives him his eye.</p>
<p t="3146750" d="4740">So now Osiris can see with the eyes of youth.</p>
<p t="3151490" d="5820">And then Horus and Osiris go back to ruling the kingdom together.</p>
<p t="3157310" d="4020">And the pharaoh is Osiris and Horus together if he is a good pharaoh.</p>
<p t="3161330" d="3780">So that means his wisdom and tradition, and attention.</p>
<p t="3165110" d="3030">And that&#39;s-- you&#39;re starting to get very close there.</p>
<p t="3168140" d="4860">Now, the Egyptians identified that Horus Osiris thing with the immortal soul.</p>
<p t="3173000" d="2610">It&#39;s like, yes, they they&#39;re right.</p>
<p t="3175610" d="2800">And it&#39;s not some trivial superstition.</p>
<p t="3178410" d="2120">It&#39;s their right.</p>
<p t="3180530" d="1590">That is the immortal soul.</p>
<p t="3182120" d="690">It&#39;s the thing.</p>
<p t="3182810" d="5110">It&#39;s the best in each person, and that&#39;s another way of thinking about it.</p>
<p t="3187920" d="3920">Now, you know, those ideas get much more developed</p>
<p t="3191840" d="2760">as we get much more civilized.</p>
<p t="3194600" d="4890">So by the end of the Egyptian periods-- they call this the democratization</p>
<p t="3199490" d="1380">of Osiris--</p>
<p t="3200870" d="2970">although only the pharaoh to begin with could sort of</p>
<p t="3203840" d="3270">use the symbolism that was associated with Osiris Horus,</p>
<p t="3207110" d="3210">it sort of spread down the dominance hierarchy.</p>
<p t="3210320" d="3140">And then for me what happens after that is that well, it</p>
<p t="3213460" d="1500">starts to get universalized, right?</p>
<p t="3214960" d="3700">So this is not a particularly linear progression.</p>
<p t="3218660" d="3780">But for the sake of simplicity, we can make the case.</p>
<p t="3222440" d="5280">The Greeks give every adult male a soul, right?</p>
<p t="3227720" d="3330">Well, by the time Christianity rolls around, it&#39;s like, oh, huh,</p>
<p t="3231050" d="720">isn&#39;t it weird?</p>
<p t="3231770" d="3690">Everybody has a soul, even the weirdos that you&#39;d rather get rid of,</p>
<p t="3235460" d="2490">even those things that you think of as enemies.</p>
<p t="3237950" d="1650">It&#39;s like it&#39;s in people.</p>
<p t="3239600" d="500">OK.</p>
<p t="3240100" d="2650">Now, Christianity really starts to play around</p>
<p t="3242750" d="2610">with exactly what the hell the soul is.</p>
<p t="3245360" d="3820">And they, you know, the ideas come out in very bizarre ways.</p>
<p t="3249180" d="3140">And like, one of the most bizarre ways is</p>
<p t="3252320" d="6480">that Christianity makes the assumption that the word of God that pulls order</p>
<p t="3258800" d="1710">out of chaos at the beginning of time--</p>
<p t="3260510" d="5490">so logos-- is the thing that&#39;s Christ, you know, so many eons later.</p>
<p t="3266000" d="1530">They&#39;re the same things.</p>
<p t="3267530" d="2200">It&#39;s like, what the hell does that mean?</p>
<p t="3269730" d="5510">Well, it&#39;s like, if you embody the immortal soul properly,</p>
<p t="3275240" d="6160">you&#39;re the thing that generates order from chaos, or sometimes the reverse.</p>
<p t="3281400" d="2700">You make-- you know, you&#39;re the transforming agent that</p>
<p t="3284100" d="2380">sits at the middle of order and chaos.</p>
<p t="3286480" d="500">OK.</p>
<p t="3286980" d="2380">So that&#39;s the same thing that was there in the beginning.</p>
<p t="3289360" d="3444">Well, that&#39;s the beginning of being, not the beginning of the universe.</p>
<p t="3292804" d="1166">It&#39;s the beginning of being.</p>
<p t="3293970" d="2530">Those aren&#39;t the same thing.</p>
<p t="3296500" d="2780">And the Christians figure out that this logos thing</p>
<p t="3299280" d="5070">is very much associated with articulated truth, articulated truth.</p>
<p t="3304350" d="3290">And so the Christian idea, in part, is--</p>
<p t="3307640" d="2650">and this is this is where Nietzsche had it wrong, I think,</p>
<p t="3310290" d="6420">because he was too cynical about Osiris.</p>
<p t="3316710" d="2150">He was too cynical about Christianity.</p>
<p t="3318860" d="4090">He thought all it was was rotten infrastructure.</p>
<p t="3322950" d="5420">So he saw how it had become dogmatized and corrupted across time.</p>
<p t="3328370" d="2280">But he didn&#39;t see what was in the center of it.</p>
<p t="3330650" d="4230">And you know, his Superman was sort of a substitute for that.</p>
<p t="3334880" d="1560">But he never fleshed that out well.</p>
<p t="3336440" d="3706">But Jung started to play with the Superman idea</p>
<p t="3340146" d="1874">and with the idea of the Philosopher&#39;s Stone.</p>
<p t="3342020" d="1380">And he was studying Christianity.</p>
<p t="3343400" d="3670">And at one point he saw, oh-oh, those are the same thing.</p>
<p t="3347070" d="2210">They&#39;re all the same thing.</p>
<p t="3349280" d="1110">It&#39;s complicated .</p>
<p t="3350390" d="2790">But one of the things that Jung recognized was</p>
<p t="3353180" d="8010">that the core doctrine of Christianity, in some sense, is the truth</p>
<p t="3361190" d="8600">buttresses you most thoroughly against the vicissitudes of being.</p>
<p t="3369790" d="5250">That&#39;s your salvation, the truth, the spoken truth.</p>
<p t="3375040" d="3680">It&#39;s not-- So you might say, well, people say--</p>
<p t="3378720" d="3360">Christians say, well, if you believe in Christ you&#39;re saved.</p>
<p t="3382080" d="4020">Well, what do you mean by belief exactly?</p>
<p t="3386100" d="2970">You say Jesus Christ is the Son of God.</p>
<p t="3389070" d="1560">And you say, I believe that.</p>
<p t="3390630" d="3690">Just because you say that, doesn&#39;t mean you believe it at all.</p>
<p t="3394320" d="2610">It has almost no bearing on what you believe.</p>
<p t="3396930" d="3180">The question is, how do you act?</p>
<p t="3400110" d="5970">And the fundamental question that&#39;s under all that is, is your speech true?</p>
<p t="3406080" d="2700">Now, then you might ask well, what does true mean?</p>
<p t="3408780" d="5220">Well, and the answer to that would be twofold.</p>
<p t="3414000" d="3097">What are you trying to do with your speech?</p>
<p t="3417097" d="1583">There&#39;s two things you can do with it.</p>
<p t="3418680" d="5670">One is you can manipulate reality so that it does what you want it to do.</p>
<p t="3424350" d="2520">And that&#39;s the sort of speech that people use when</p>
<p t="3426870" d="1830">they&#39;re trying to get what they want.</p>
<p t="3428700" d="4800">The problem with that is that there&#39;s no way that they can actually</p>
<p t="3433500" d="1290">know what they want.</p>
<p t="3434790" d="4410">They just hypothesize what it is that they want based on some theory,</p>
<p t="3439200" d="2940">and then they try to manipulate the world so that they get that.</p>
<p t="3442140" d="1830">But it&#39;s an unsatisfying venture.</p>
<p t="3443970" d="3030">And often, when they do get it, it&#39;s not good anyways.</p>
<p t="3447000" d="3300">So it involves a kind of falsity of speech.</p>
<p t="3450300" d="7110">The other way is to try to say what you mean and think and perceive as clearly</p>
<p t="3457410" d="4440">as you possibly can, always, and see what happens.</p>
<p t="3461850" d="2924">Now, the story that underlies Christianity--</p>
<p t="3464774" d="3166">and it&#39;s not only Christianity, but it&#39;s Christianity that I&#39;m most familiar</p>
<p t="3467940" d="500">with--</p>
<p t="3468440" d="1120">is that.</p>
<p t="3469560" d="5940">The rule is live in accordance with the truth and see what happens.</p>
<p t="3475500" d="3140">So in the Sermon on the Mount, for example, Christ basically says--</p>
<p t="3482550" d="3500">set your sights on allegiance to God.</p>
<p t="3486050" d="3730">It&#39;s like, whatever the highest value is, we&#39;ll say.</p>
<p t="3489780" d="3600">And act in a manner that&#39;s concordant with that.</p>
<p t="3493380" d="1200">So that&#39;s your goal.</p>
<p t="3494580" d="6460">Then pay attention to it here and now, your best strategy for the future.</p>
<p t="3501040" d="2350">Then you might say, well, prove that.</p>
<p t="3503390" d="2800">Well, that that&#39;s when the question starts to become existential.</p>
<p t="3506190" d="1500">It&#39;s like, well, you can&#39;t prove it.</p>
<p t="3507690" d="1230">You have to try it.</p>
<p t="3508920" d="2830">That&#39;s like Kierkegaard&#39;s leap of faith.</p>
<p t="3511750" d="3630">You cannot tell if this works unless you do it.</p>
<p t="3515380" d="1190">And that&#39;s a commitment.</p>
<p t="3516570" d="3870">It&#39;s like, those two ways of being, like the manipulative way of being.</p>
<p t="3520440" d="2535">That&#39;s an adversarial way of being archetypally.</p>
<p t="3522975" d="3405">It&#39;s Manipulative It&#39;s got the lie at its core.</p>
<p t="3526380" d="4860">That&#39;s completely different than this path.</p>
<p t="3531240" d="1080">So it&#39;s a hypothesis.</p>
<p t="3532320" d="3030">Well, it&#39;s a hypothesis that Jung did a good job of elaborating,</p>
<p t="3535350" d="4860">although you know, even with Jung it&#39;s not fully articulated.</p>
<p t="3540210" d="2610">He&#39;s still saturated in image to a large degree.</p>
<p t="3542820" d="3900">But no wonder-- it&#39;s very complicated to make this sort of thing fully</p>
<p t="3546720" d="1530">articulated.</p>
<p t="3548250" d="1380">You read Solzhenitsyn.</p>
<p t="3549630" d="2550">You think, OK, why did the Soviet Union become</p>
<p t="3552180" d="2550">the absolute hellhole that it was?</p>
<p t="3554730" d="3420">Solzhenitsyn says because everyone lied.</p>
<p t="3558150" d="1750">It&#39;s like, oh, isn&#39;t that interesting?</p>
<p t="3559900" d="2695">Well, that isn&#39;t a hypothesis that you hear every day.</p>
<p t="3562595" d="2125">So then you think about Freud, and you think, well,</p>
<p t="3564720" d="2390">what&#39;s the major cause of mental illness?</p>
<p t="3567110" d="1720">Repression.</p>
<p t="3568830" d="2610">Well, that&#39;s a lie, fundamentally.</p>
<p t="3571440" d="3850">I mean, Freud&#39;s played around with it to some degree.</p>
<p t="3575290" d="6960">So it&#39;s sort of like, it&#39;s more like lying by omission actually</p>
<p t="3582250" d="1174">than lying by commission.</p>
<p t="3583424" d="916">But it doesn&#39;t matter.</p>
<p t="3584340" d="880">It&#39;s still lying.</p>
<p t="3585220" d="1512">Jung says the same thing.</p>
<p t="3586732" d="2958">It&#39;s like, oh, well, wouldn&#39;t it be interesting if the fundamental root</p>
<p t="3589690" d="3450">of psychopathology was the lie, the fundamental root</p>
<p t="3593140" d="2970">of political psychopathology is the lie.</p>
<p t="3596110" d="4470">It&#39;s like, well, what if that&#39;s what&#39;s demolishing your life?</p>
<p t="3600580" d="6250">People say, well, people think-- especially when they&#39;re nihilistic</p>
<p t="3606830" d="3200">and they become destructive-- that the universe is sort of--</p>
<p t="3610030" d="2020">it&#39;s an unfair and arbitrary place and it&#39;s</p>
<p t="3612050" d="3690">basically bent on their random destruction while they suffer.</p>
<p t="3615740" d="1410">It&#39;s something like that.</p>
<p t="3617150" d="660">Yeah.</p>
<p t="3617810" d="930">Right.</p>
<p t="3618740" d="660">OK.</p>
<p t="3619400" d="2460">What do you do under those circumstances?</p>
<p t="3621860" d="1410">That&#39;s the question.</p>
<p t="3623270" d="5730">Well, one potential answer is twist the thing</p>
<p t="3629000" d="3930">so that you can maybe get what you hypothetically want out of it.</p>
<p t="3632930" d="4850">The other is rely on your perceptions and your capacity</p>
<p t="3637780" d="3320">for accurate representation.</p>
<p t="3641100" d="1050">Communicate that.</p>
<p t="3642150" d="1860">And take your chances.</p>
<p t="3644010" d="1230">It&#39;s like, who&#39;s right?</p>
<p t="3645240" d="2370">Well, that&#39;s the battle between good and evil.</p>
<p t="3647610" d="1810">Who&#39;s right?</p>
<p t="3649420" d="2034">It&#39;s a continual battle.</p>
<p t="3651454" d="2166">SPEAKER: I think it&#39;s really important to drive home</p>
<p t="3653620" d="5570">this notion of right and truth you&#39;re talking about here in terms of action.</p>
<p t="3659190" d="1840">Was is the right action?</p>
<p t="3661030" d="3980">Because action is essentially-- it&#39;s almost a unit of truth</p>
<p t="3665010" d="2614">that you&#39;re hypothesizing based on.</p>
<p t="3667624" d="916">JORDAN PETERSON: Yeah.</p>
<p t="3668540" d="500">Yeah.</p>
<p t="3669040" d="2437">SPEAKER: But for most people, I think, when</p>
<p t="3671477" d="2333">they hear the word truth, especially people in academia,</p>
<p t="3673810" d="3740">or people involved in the sciences in any way, they think</p>
<p t="3677550" d="2050">is something very different.</p>
<p t="3679600" d="1750">JORDAN PETERSON: Yes, of course.</p>
<p t="3681350" d="2350">Their truth is representational.</p>
<p t="3683700" d="717">SPEAKER: Right.</p>
<p t="3684417" d="1333">Can you elaborate maybe on this?</p>
<p t="3685750" d="875">JORDAN PETERSON: See.</p>
<p t="3686625" d="3845">That&#39;s also-- that&#39;s also partly why the Catholic church historically has been</p>
<p t="3690470" d="4320">so put off by the rational intellect.</p>
<p t="3694790" d="2400">You know, like people like Dawkins say, well, you know,</p>
<p t="3697190" d="3480">yeah, they went after Galileo because he was undermining their superstitions.</p>
<p t="3700670" d="1860">It&#39;s like, yeah.</p>
<p t="3702530" d="1890">Partly right.</p>
<p t="3704420" d="5610">The other part was Seth, like the figure of evil throughout history</p>
<p t="3710030" d="3300">is always the hyper rational intellect.</p>
<p t="3713330" d="3180">And the reason for that is the intellect is God&#39;s highest angel.</p>
<p t="3716510" d="1980">So that&#39;s Lucifer.</p>
<p t="3718490" d="2190">And it falls in love with its own creations.</p>
<p t="3720680" d="3090">It likes to make totalities out of its own creation.</p>
<p t="3723770" d="2910">Once there&#39;s a totality, there&#39;s no room for the transcendent.</p>
<p t="3726680" d="840">There&#39;s no god.</p>
<p t="3727520" d="1980">That&#39;s Satan&#39;s error, by the way.</p>
<p t="3729500" d="2770">And everything immediately turns into hell.</p>
<p t="3732270" d="4670">Now, you see, that was all put together particularly well by Milton.</p>
<p t="3736940" d="1800">And Milton was a visionary.</p>
<p t="3738740" d="6150">And what Milton felt and put together was the imagistic substrate out</p>
<p t="3744890" d="3360">of which the totalitarian states were going to grow.</p>
<p t="3748250" d="900">He envisioned it.</p>
<p t="3749150" d="1260">Now, was visionary.</p>
<p t="3750410" d="3530">He saw it as a battle between heavenly agents.</p>
<p t="3753940" d="820">But he codified it.</p>
<p t="3754760" d="4720">And he said, well, you know, here&#39;s the approaching problem.</p>
<p t="3759480" d="3490">Here&#39;s the approaching problem, the totalitarian intellect.</p>
<p t="3762970" d="2320">It&#39;s like, and that&#39;s exactly right.</p>
<p t="3765290" d="4410">If you talk to people who are suffering existentially,</p>
<p t="3769700" d="2500">they&#39;re always in love with the products of their intellect.</p>
<p t="3772200" d="1860">They do not pay attention.</p>
<p t="3774060" d="2730">They say, well, I can&#39;t see how my life has any meaning.</p>
<p t="3776790" d="4140">An answer to that is you&#39;re not seeing, you&#39;re thinking.</p>
<p t="3780930" d="3990">And you can easily think yourself into a corner where your life has no meaning.</p>
<p t="3784920" d="1450">It&#39;s a cheap trick.</p>
<p t="3786370" d="3140">I can say, who cares about this documentary?</p>
<p t="3789510" d="2500">It&#39;s not going to matter in a billion years.</p>
<p t="3792010" d="500">Right?</p>
<p t="3792510" d="1650">Or in 100 years, or whatever.</p>
<p t="3794160" d="4250">I can pick a time frame within which this event is irrelevant.</p>
<p t="3798410" d="790">OK.</p>
<p t="3799200" d="3900">So then you can derive from that fact that it&#39;s irrelevant.</p>
<p t="3803100" d="3840">Or you can derive from that fact that that&#39;s a stupid way to think.</p>
<p t="3810390" d="3930">You can derive the conclusion that it&#39;s a stupid way</p>
<p t="3814320" d="4259">to think if you haven&#39;t made thinking your god.</p>
<p t="3818579" d="2791">So and there&#39;s lots of other things that work better than thinking.</p>
<p t="3821370" d="2160">Paying attention is better than thinking.</p>
<p t="3823530" d="1560">It&#39;s much better than thinking.</p>
<p t="3825090" d="3270">Paying attention allows you to listen to people who don&#39;t agree with you.</p>
<p t="3828360" d="3420">Paying attention allows you learn things that you don&#39;t already know.</p>
<p t="3831780" d="3490">So you know, if it&#39;s thinking or attention that should be the god,</p>
<p t="3835270" d="2630">it&#39;s like, attention rules.</p>
<p t="3837900" d="2360">Thinking, that&#39;s a subordinate phenomena.</p>
<p t="3840260" d="2950">But it likes to pop up on top, you know, because it</p>
<p t="3843210" d="1350">likes its little tight theories.</p>
<p t="3844560" d="2010">And it likes to be right.</p>
<p t="3846570" d="3360">Well, you know, forget that.</p>
<p t="3849930" d="1920">You&#39;re not going to be right.</p>
<p t="3851850" d="7350">You could say that the image of Christ is the West&#39;s attempt</p>
<p t="3859200" d="5640">to most accurately represent the path of being</p>
<p t="3864840" d="5400">that constitutes success across an infinite set of dominance hierarchies.</p>
<p t="3870240" d="3630">That&#39;s essentially-- or that&#39;s it that&#39;s at least one way of looking at it.</p>
<p t="3873870" d="1620">Now, there are figures--</p>
<p t="3875490" d="2730">hero figures, you know-- because Christ is like a hero,</p>
<p t="3878220" d="1530">but he&#39;s sort of a meta hero, right?</p>
<p t="3879750" d="4110">He&#39;s the amalgam of many, many, many, many heroes.</p>
<p t="3883860" d="2910">But the hero has key attributes.</p>
<p t="3886770" d="3990">Like the hero, for example, is always encountering chaos and defeating it.</p>
<p t="3890760" d="1740">Well, that&#39;s the human path.</p>
<p t="3892500" d="2020">You know, we encounter chaos.</p>
<p t="3894520" d="1630">It&#39;s often a snake.</p>
<p t="3896150" d="3220">Well, that also points to its deep evolutionary roots.</p>
<p t="3899370" d="5190">So there&#39;s a anthropologist, Lynne Isbell,</p>
<p t="3904560" d="3450">who wrote a book a while back called The Tree The Serpent In Vision--</p>
<p t="3908010" d="1530">I think I&#39;ve got that right.</p>
<p t="3909540" d="2760">And she was interested in why human beings can see so well.</p>
<p t="3912300" d="1650">Because we can see really well.</p>
<p t="3913950" d="3480">The only things that can see better than us are birds of prey.</p>
<p t="3917430" d="3510">And she thought, well, why would a primate like us have such good vision?</p>
<p t="3920940" d="1540">So she went around the world.</p>
<p t="3922480" d="2810">She thought-- she knew also that we were particularly</p>
<p t="3925290" d="3300">good at detecting the kind of camouflage patterns</p>
<p t="3928590" d="3786">that characterize snakes, especially in the lower half of our visual field.</p>
<p t="3932376" d="1624">And she was kind of curious about that.</p>
<p t="3934000" d="3260">And then she thought, well, you know, maybe we were preyed upon by snakes.</p>
<p t="3937260" d="3208">And you know, maybe we had to develop that vision because we were preyed upon</p>
<p t="3940468" d="3272">by snakes, like, you know, 60 million years ago, way back when</p>
<p t="3943740" d="2730">we weren&#39;t even people, which is about how old snakes are.</p>
<p t="3946470" d="2340">It&#39;s like 60 million years or something like that.</p>
<p t="3948810" d="2040">So then she went around the world and she</p>
<p t="3950850" d="3570">correlated the equity of primate vision with the prevalence</p>
<p t="3954420" d="1260">of predatory snakes.</p>
<p t="3955680" d="2130">It&#39;s like, nice correlation.</p>
<p t="3957810" d="3360">So she thought oh, human beings and snakes co-evolved.</p>
<p t="3961170" d="2040">Well, so what gives you vision?</p>
<p t="3963210" d="1050">Snakes.</p>
<p t="3964260" d="1560">That&#39;s what it says in Genesis.</p>
<p t="3965820" d="1190">What else gives you vision?</p>
<p t="3967010" d="1240">Fruit.</p>
<p t="3968250" d="780">That&#39;s also right.</p>
<p t="3969030" d="1571">That&#39;s why we have color vision.</p>
<p t="3970601" d="499">Right?</p>
<p t="3971100" d="2820">What makes you self-conscious if you&#39;re a man?</p>
<p t="3973920" d="1581">Women.</p>
<p t="3975501" d="499">Right?</p>
<p t="3976000" d="1410">That&#39;s Eve.</p>
<p t="3977410" d="5130">So you know, the stories in the Bible, the pre-flood stories,</p>
<p t="3982540" d="1770">they are really old.</p>
<p t="3984310" d="2250">We have no idea how old they are.</p>
<p t="3986560" d="2760">And like they&#39;re extremely old.</p>
<p t="3989320" d="4350">And you might say, well, in story form, well, like, actual story form--</p>
<p t="3993670" d="1690">god only knows how well they are--</p>
<p t="3995360" d="4820">but in terms of behavioral pattern, they could easily be 60 million years old.</p>
<p t="4000180" d="4380">It&#39;s like, the thing that defeats the snake gets the women.</p>
<p t="4004560" d="3090">And you imagine that in tree dwelling primates, say.</p>
<p t="4007650" d="1990">Well, up comes the snakes.</p>
<p t="4009640" d="3170">It&#39;s like, the first guy who figured out how to drop a stick on a snake,</p>
<p t="4012810" d="2410">he was very popular.</p>
<p t="4015220" d="4940">So you know, so the snake what&#39;s happened is that religion--</p>
<p t="4020160" d="2700">so what&#39;s happened as far as I can tell is</p>
<p t="4022860" d="4850">that the systems that our brain evolved to detect basically</p>
<p t="4027710" d="1440">rapacious predators.</p>
<p t="4029150" d="3910">It&#39;s not just snakes, but it be like reptiles</p>
<p t="4033060" d="5150">with teeth, predators in the dark, things under the water,</p>
<p t="4038210" d="2160">like crocodiles.</p>
<p t="4040370" d="4260">That&#39;s like-- that&#39;s the lurking anomaly, right?</p>
<p t="4044630" d="1680">It&#39;s the thing you have to contend with.</p>
<p t="4046310" d="1680">And it&#39;s actually a monster.</p>
<p t="4047990" d="2080">People say monsters aren&#39;t real.</p>
<p t="4050070" d="2020">It&#39;s like, it depends on your time frame.</p>
<p t="4052090" d="4000">If you add up and average all the predatory monsters across 60 million</p>
<p t="4056090" d="1770">years, you get a monster.</p>
<p t="4057860" d="1470">OK.</p>
<p t="4059330" d="5940">So the amalgam of monster is a representation</p>
<p t="4065270" d="2460">of the class of predatory stimuli.</p>
<p t="4067730" d="1680">That might be a way of looking at it.</p>
<p t="4069410" d="500">OK.</p>
<p t="4069910" d="3190">So we&#39;re very sensitive to that because we were prey animals.</p>
<p t="4073100" d="4270">OK, then our cortex leapt up our level of abstraction.</p>
<p t="4077370" d="4760">So then that same system started to detect anomaly as such.</p>
<p t="4082130" d="3450">It wasn&#39;t just the predatory thing that was outside the dominance hierarchy.</p>
<p t="4085580" d="3790">It was the abstract thing that was outside the system of ideas.</p>
<p t="4089370" d="860">It&#39;s the same thing.</p>
<p t="4090230" d="3680">And so that became symbolized by the chaos monster.</p>
<p t="4093910" d="2387">And we can easily throw that on our enemies.</p>
<p t="4096297" d="2333">It&#39;s like, well, who are / you&#39;re outside the hierarchy.</p>
<p t="4098630" d="2250">Oh, you&#39;re a chaos monster.</p>
<p t="4100880" d="1769">Well, yes you are.</p>
<p t="4102649" d="2531">That&#39;s not a arbitrary prejudice.</p>
<p t="4105180" d="2670">It&#39;s like, you are absolutely a chaos monster.</p>
<p t="4107850" d="3350">Then the question is what do you do with chaos monsters.</p>
<p t="4111200" d="1380">One answer is kill them.</p>
<p t="4112580" d="2760">The other answer is get their gold.</p>
<p t="4115340" d="1800">That&#39;s a better answer.</p>
<p t="4117140" d="1710">Because there&#39;s information and chaos.</p>
<p t="4118850" d="2310">And we&#39;re information scavengers.</p>
<p t="4121160" d="1110">And that&#39;s our niche.</p>
<p t="4122270" d="4320">It&#39;s like, outside what we know, there&#39;s information.</p>
<p t="4126590" d="2820">You might die retrieving it.</p>
<p t="4129410" d="4331">But if you don&#39;t die, you&#39;re like a major hero.</p>
<p t="4133741" d="499">Yeah.</p>
<p t="4134240" d="1150">That&#39;s right.</p>
<p t="4135390" d="4730">SPEAKER: So was this the sense in which these religious or love</p>
<p t="4140120" d="2624">mythological stories and images are true.</p>
<p t="4142744" d="916">JORDAN PETERSON: Yeah.</p>
<p t="4143660" d="5360">SPEAKER: Except in the sense that they instruct action in a way that--</p>
<p t="4149020" d="1419">in the Darwinian sense--</p>
<p t="4150439" d="931">is true.</p>
<p t="4151370" d="958">JORDAN PETERSON: Great.</p>
<p t="4152328" d="3382">And that&#39;s the only sense in which truth exists.</p>
<p t="4155710" d="1381">Well, if you&#39;re a Darwinian.</p>
<p t="4157091" d="499">Right.</p>
<p t="4157590" d="1875">So that&#39;s the problem with modern scientists.</p>
<p t="4159465" d="3285">It&#39;s like, are you Newtonian or are you Darwinian?</p>
<p t="4162750" d="790">It&#39;s like Newton.</p>
<p t="4163540" d="1500">He&#39;s wrong, by the way.</p>
<p t="4165040" d="500">Right.</p>
<p t="4165540" d="4170">We already know that because Newton is only a subset of Einstein, let&#39;s say.</p>
<p t="4169710" d="3896">And god only knows what the whole quantum thing is going to end up being.</p>
<p t="4173606" d="2583">We don&#39;t even know how to structure our thoughts in accordance</p>
<p t="4176189" d="1621">with those presuppositions.</p>
<p t="4177810" d="1560">But Darwin trumps Newton.</p>
<p t="4179370" d="2199">That&#39;s my hypothesis.</p>
<p t="4181569" d="4191">So you know, you might say, those who--</p>
<p t="4185760" d="6450">so then the question is what attitude towards religion is truly scientific?</p>
<p t="4192210" d="4650">I think my attitude towards religion is precisely scientific</p>
<p t="4196860" d="2160">because it&#39;s predicated on Darwinian--</p>
<p t="4199020" d="3090">really on Darwinian pre-suppositions.</p>
<p t="4202110" d="1740">Dawkins is a rationalist.</p>
<p t="4203850" d="1680">He&#39;s not a Darwinian.</p>
<p t="4205530" d="1740">He just thinks he&#39;s a Darwinian.</p>
<p t="4207270" d="500">SPEAKER: OK.</p>
<p t="4207770" d="2590">Can we explore this a little bit in terms</p>
<p t="4210360" d="3930">of describing how you&#39;re working with these definitions.</p>
<p t="4214290" d="4020">When you say that your approach to religion is a Darwinian one,</p>
<p t="4218310" d="2049">and Dawkins is-- unwittingly perhaps--</p>
<p t="4220359" d="1791">JORDAN PETERSON: He&#39;s an enlightenment guy.</p>
<p t="4222150" d="540">SPEAKER: Right.</p>
<p t="4222690" d="2291">JORDAN PETERSON: The Enlightenment is like, it&#39;s really</p>
<p t="4224981" d="4819">thin paint on a mile deep piece of rock.</p>
<p t="4229800" d="1206">It&#39;s nothing.</p>
<p t="4231006" d="2124">One of the things I really liked about reading Jung</p>
<p t="4233130" d="4650">was that Jung tracks the development of thought say, back 10,000 years.</p>
<p t="4237780" d="3240">It&#39;s like, wow, that&#39;s a 10,000 year span of history.</p>
<p t="4241020" d="1380">That&#39;s a long time.</p>
<p t="4242400" d="3000">It&#39;s like, well, not compared to 300 million years.</p>
<p t="4245400" d="1350">That&#39;s a really long time.</p>
<p t="4246750" d="4500">OK so if we&#39;re going to talk about the Darwinian underpinnings of the brain,</p>
<p t="4251250" d="4000">or of the human organism, let&#39;s use some time spans.</p>
<p t="4255250" d="4160">So Dawkins has Darwinism painted on Enlightenment rationality.</p>
<p t="4259410" d="1720">He&#39;s an enlightenment guy.</p>
<p t="4261130" d="1636">It&#39;s like, rationality rules.</p>
<p t="4262766" d="2124">It&#39;s like, this is how you make sense of the world.</p>
<p t="4264890" d="4000">It&#39;s like, OK, well, we thought that more or less for 400 years.</p>
<p t="4268890" d="6080">So what did we think for the other like, 300 million years?</p>
<p t="4274970" d="3860">How did we manage without that if it&#39;s truth.</p>
<p t="4278830" d="3170">So it&#39;s a form of truth.</p>
<p t="4282000" d="1920">It&#39;s a partial form of truth.</p>
<p t="4283920" d="2880">And it&#39;s a powerful partial form of truth.</p>
<p t="4286800" d="6150">But to say it&#39;s truth well, then depends on what you mean by truth.</p>
<p t="4292950" d="510">So yeah.</p>
<p t="4293460" d="1500">Well, and that&#39;s where it gets back.</p>
<p t="4294960" d="3270">And that&#39;s where it starts to go back into the Darwinian issue, which</p>
<p t="4298230" d="5760">is there&#39;s only one way you can define truth in relationship to finite beings.</p>
<p t="4303990" d="1770">It&#39;s true enough.</p>
<p t="4305760" d="1710">True enough for what?</p>
<p t="4307470" d="3030">True enough so that you survive and reproduce.</p>
<p t="4310500" d="1050">That&#39;s it.</p>
<p t="4311550" d="1560">You don&#39;t get to go any farther.</p>
<p t="4313110" d="1230">What&#39;s more true than that?</p>
<p t="4314340" d="2380">Sorry, can&#39;t ask that question.</p>
<p t="4316720" d="800">That&#39;s it.</p>
<p t="4317520" d="1050">You&#39;ve hit the limit.</p>
<p t="4318570" d="1840">And that&#39;s basically Darwin&#39;s claim.</p>
<p t="4320410" d="2317">And that&#39;s what the pragmatists recognized as well.</p>
<p t="4322727" d="2416">SPEAKER: So it was another way of-- that&#39;s really helpful,</p>
<p t="4325143" d="962">what&#39;s you just went through.</p>
<p t="4326105" d="1291">That&#39;s going to be very useful.</p>
<p t="4327396" d="2844">So there&#39;s another way of articulating that.</p>
<p t="4330240" d="7309">What is true is what enables you to successfully achieve a goal.</p>
<p t="4337549" d="2291">JORDAN PETERSON: That&#39;s what that&#39;s what&#39;s true enough.</p>
<p t="4339840" d="180">SPEAKER: Right</p>
<p t="4340020" d="420">JORDAN PETERSON: Right.</p>
<p t="4340440" d="1560">But there&#39;s only true enough.</p>
<p t="4342000" d="3540">But there&#39;s like, there&#39;s varieties of true enough.</p>
<p t="4345540" d="2820">So it doesn&#39;t turn you into a relativist.</p>
<p t="4348360" d="2370">It&#39;s like, some things are only true for one thing.</p>
<p t="4350730" d="2070">Some things are true for 10 things.</p>
<p t="4352800" d="2640">Some things are true for a million things.</p>
<p t="4355440" d="1980">It&#39;s like, well, that&#39;s a better truth.</p>
<p t="4357420" d="3330">Well, and what the religious imagination,</p>
<p t="4360750" d="2820">which is the imagination that&#39;s concerned with values,</p>
<p t="4363570" d="3390">is always trying to determine is well, what&#39;s the highest value?</p>
<p t="4366960" d="2760">That&#39;s the religious question, what&#39;s the highest value, which</p>
<p t="4369720" d="10870">is what should you serve, let&#39;s say, to ensure your viability</p>
<p t="4380590" d="2920">across the broadest domain of time.</p>
<p t="4383510" d="2030">Well, we don&#39;t know.</p>
<p t="4385540" d="3387">So what we&#39;ve done is well, we&#39;ve watched successful people.</p>
<p t="4388927" d="1083">What does successful mean?</p>
<p t="4390010" d="1290">Well, we know what it means.</p>
<p t="4391300" d="2155">We can stay within the Darwinian framework.</p>
<p t="4393455" d="3125">I mean, I don&#39;t think, by the way, I don&#39;t think the Darwinian framework is</p>
<p t="4396580" d="4320">the last word on things because we&#39;re starting to discover, for example,</p>
<p t="4400900" d="2530">that there are epigenetic transformations.</p>
<p t="4403430" d="1700">So you know, we&#39;ll see where that goes.</p>
<p t="4405130" d="1833">It&#39;s going to go somewhere very interesting.</p>
<p t="4406963" d="677">But that&#39;s OK.</p>
<p t="4407640" d="7280">For the time being, we&#39;re enamored of successful people.</p>
<p t="4414920" d="1050">OK.</p>
<p t="4415970" d="4890">There&#39;s a successful person A, successful person B, successful person</p>
<p t="4420860" d="3820">C. And what makes them the same is that they&#39;re successful.</p>
<p t="4424680" d="500">OK.</p>
<p t="4425180" d="3030">Then the question is what is successful?</p>
<p t="4428210" d="3930">Well, then, in some sense, the variations of hero mythology</p>
<p t="4432140" d="3462">are complex answers to that question.</p>
<p t="4435602" d="2208">It&#39;s like, well, if you&#39;re a hero, you&#39;re successful.</p>
<p t="4437810" d="2250">Well, there&#39;s a bunch of different kinds of heroes.</p>
<p t="4440060" d="210">OK.</p>
<p t="4440270" d="1620">So you get all these heroes together.</p>
<p t="4441890" d="1830">They have a big fight.</p>
<p t="4443720" d="1590">Who comes up on top?</p>
<p t="4445310" d="3840">Well, I can tell you one answer to that because that&#39;s exactly what happens</p>
<p t="4449150" d="1770">in Mesopotamian mythology.</p>
<p t="4450920" d="1500">It&#39;s like there&#39;s a bunch of heroes.</p>
<p t="4452420" d="1260">They&#39;re gods.</p>
<p t="4453680" d="4050">And then they&#39;re confronted by a horrible chaos monster that actually</p>
<p t="4457730" d="2460">gave birth to them, that&#39;s Tiamat.</p>
<p t="4460190" d="8030">And these gods, they know that singly she&#39;ll just claw them to nothing.</p>
<p t="4468220" d="2330">So they&#39;re all freaking out about this.</p>
<p t="4470550" d="2130">And then, at one point, a new god gets born.</p>
<p t="4472680" d="1800">His name is Marduk.</p>
<p t="4474480" d="3350">He&#39;s kind of an interesting god because he could speak magic words.</p>
<p t="4477830" d="2320">And he has eyes all the way around his head.</p>
<p t="4480150" d="4010">So they send out a god now and then to go after Tiamat</p>
<p t="4484160" d="3310">because she&#39;s angry with them for making too much racket, essentially,</p>
<p t="4487470" d="1320">and killing her husband.</p>
<p t="4488790" d="1320">It&#39;s not a very good idea.</p>
<p t="4490110" d="1200">They&#39;re careless.</p>
<p t="4491310" d="2310">They&#39;re like two-year-olds, really.</p>
<p t="4493620" d="3360">So they throw out a god now and then to go fight Tiamat,</p>
<p t="4496980" d="1252">but she just warps them.</p>
<p t="4498232" d="1208">There&#39;s not even any context.</p>
<p t="4499440" d="2994">So this Marduk is born.</p>
<p t="4502434" d="666">And he grows up.</p>
<p t="4503100" d="1583">And they&#39;re pretty impressed with him.</p>
<p t="4504683" d="3037">So they asked him one day, well, how would you like to go fight Tiamat.</p>
<p t="4507720" d="3150">And you know, maybe he&#39;s not too thrilled about that.</p>
<p t="4510870" d="1470">But he says, OK, OK, I&#39;ll do it.</p>
<p t="4512340" d="1260">But here&#39;s the rule.</p>
<p t="4513600" d="1230">Call the council.</p>
<p t="4514830" d="1170">You put me in charge.</p>
<p t="4516000" d="1230">I&#39;m top god.</p>
<p t="4517230" d="2970">And that means from here on in I determine destiny.</p>
<p t="4520200" d="4200">So here is the thing that determines the way the future is going to unfold.</p>
<p t="4524400" d="3420">And they&#39;re not that about that, but they arrange them into a hierarchy,</p>
<p t="4527820" d="1650">and they put him on top.</p>
<p t="4529470" d="2970">And then he goes out and he catches Tiamat in the net.</p>
<p t="4532440" d="4500">So he conceptualizes her, so to speak, cuts her into pieces,</p>
<p t="4536940" d="1170">makes the world out of her.</p>
<p t="4538110" d="2520">It&#39;s like, that&#39;s what a human being does.</p>
<p t="4540630" d="4410">Pays attention to where the chaos is, encapsulates it, cuts it up,</p>
<p t="4545040" d="930">makes the world.</p>
<p t="4545970" d="4200">One of his names was actually He Who Makes Ingenious Things Out</p>
<p t="4550170" d="2160">Of The Combat With Tiamat.</p>
<p t="4552330" d="2850">It was actually like a literal name of Marduk.</p>
<p t="4555180" d="3840">And so the Mesopotamian emperor had to imitate Marduk.</p>
<p t="4559020" d="2640">So to the degree that he had sovereignty,</p>
<p t="4561660" d="3190">the reason he had sovereignty was he was a Marduk.</p>
<p t="4564850" d="2690">And then he could be a good Marduk or a bad Marduk.</p>
<p t="4567540" d="4130">So at the New Year&#39;s festival, they&#39;d take the King outside the city.</p>
<p t="4571670" d="1300">So that&#39;s out in chaos.</p>
<p t="4572970" d="2189">They&#39;d strip him of his kingly clothes.</p>
<p t="4575159" d="1291">And then they&#39;d make him kneel.</p>
<p t="4576450" d="3300">And then he had to confess to all the ways</p>
<p t="4579750" d="1980">that year he hadn&#39;t been a very good Marduk.</p>
<p t="4581730" d="1920">They&#39;d actually hit him with something first.</p>
<p t="4583650" d="900">Then he had to confess.</p>
<p t="4584550" d="2083">Well, I wasn&#39;t a good Marduk this way or that way.</p>
<p t="4586633" d="3177">And you know, so it got all the sins out in the open.</p>
<p t="4589810" d="4040">Then they had a big ceremony with the like, the statues of the gods.</p>
<p t="4593850" d="3300">They replayed the battle between Marduk and Tiamat.</p>
<p t="4597150" d="2400">And then there were some other things that</p>
<p t="4599550" d="1780">happened too, which I won&#39;t get into.</p>
<p t="4601330" d="3470">But then they went back inside, and the new year was renewed.</p>
<p t="4604800" d="5400">So they acted out the eternal battle between attention,</p>
<p t="4610200" d="3570">say, and embodied attention and chaos.</p>
<p t="4613770" d="2130">And they realized that reverence for that</p>
<p t="4615900" d="6600">was the basis for valid authority, valid authority.</p>
<p t="4622500" d="3750">And the King had a moral obligation to act in that manner.</p>
<p t="4626250" d="2460">That&#39;s why he got to be King.</p>
<p t="4628710" d="1170">It&#39;s like, brilliant.</p>
<p t="4629880" d="3200">Now, you say, well, are they conscious of this?</p>
<p t="4633080" d="3090">They&#39;re conscious enough to act it out.</p>
<p t="4636170" d="500">Right?</p>
<p t="4636670" d="1530">That&#39;s as conscious as they were.</p>
<p t="4638200" d="3360">They could use their bodies and their collective</p>
<p t="4641560" d="2514">as a representational mechanism.</p>
<p t="4644074" d="3166">But they couldn&#39;t-- you know, and then they could tell stories about it too.</p>
<p t="4647240" d="5040">But as far as deriving out what that meant philosophically</p>
<p t="4652280" d="4769">and in a fully articulated way, it&#39;s like, no, they couldn&#39;t do that.</p>
<p t="4657049" d="1541">SPEAKER: Which is fascinating for me.</p>
<p t="4658590" d="1630">So what this seems to imply--</p>
<p t="4660220" d="2290">at least my interpretation of what you&#39;re saying--</p>
<p t="4662510" d="4620">is that religious systems that are often derided by, let&#39;s say,</p>
<p t="4667130" d="3940">enlightenment or post enlightenment thinkers for their--</p>
<p t="4671070" d="3250">for axioms that are just not true, that are false about the world.</p>
<p t="4674320" d="240">JORDAN PETERSON: Right.</p>
<p t="4674560" d="340">That&#39;s--</p>
<p t="4674900" d="560">SPEAKER: Oh, that&#39;s a religion.</p>
<p t="4675460" d="2390">That&#39;s religious superstition-- is clearly wrong.</p>
<p t="4677850" d="1390">That&#39;s backwards.</p>
<p t="4679240" d="6410">But what you&#39;re saying is they were and are very much true in the sense</p>
<p t="4685650" d="6781">that they are almost pre-conscious representations of correct action.</p>
<p t="4692431" d="2499">JORDAN PETERSON: And the environment in which correct action</p>
<p t="4694930" d="3400">takes place, which is fundamentally the dominance hierarchy.</p>
<p t="4698330" d="580">Right.</p>
<p t="4698910" d="4640">Like, we don&#39;t contend with protons and atoms.</p>
<p t="4703550" d="2760">We contend mostly with other people.</p>
<p t="4706310" d="2790">And to some degree, we contend with nature.</p>
<p t="4709100" d="3930">But nature is sort of outside our proper domain.</p>
<p t="4713030" d="3530">That&#39;s partly why that idea infuses environmentalism.</p>
<p t="4716560" d="3640">It&#39;s like, environmental is mythology, to the core.</p>
<p t="4720200" d="2120">It&#39;s like, pure mother nature.</p>
<p t="4722320" d="1660">She&#39;s a virgin.</p>
<p t="4723980" d="5310">And she&#39;s being raped by the terrible father and his evil sons.</p>
<p t="4729290" d="1470">It&#39;s like, yeah, yeah, true.</p>
<p t="4730760" d="3690">But what about the good father and his good sons, and cancer?</p>
<p t="4734450" d="4590">And you know, there was this horrible worm in Africa</p>
<p t="4739040" d="2640">that used to burrow inside people&#39;s skin.</p>
<p t="4741680" d="1060">Yeah, it&#39;s horrible.</p>
<p t="4742740" d="1310">And it was just eradicated.</p>
<p t="4744050" d="3930">So some doctor took it upon himself to get rid of that worm.</p>
<p t="4747980" d="2580">It&#39;s like, yeah, well, that&#39;s mother nature too, you know.</p>
<p t="4750560" d="3830">So environmentalism is an ideology because it only tells half the story.</p>
<p t="4754390" d="2541">Of course, people are rapacious and horrible.</p>
<p t="4756931" d="2249">You know, and mother nature is beautiful and virginal.</p>
<p t="4759180" d="920">Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p t="4760100" d="3510">But she&#39;s also an absolute terror.</p>
<p t="4763610" d="3600">And you better be thankful for the fact that you have a roof over your head,</p>
<p t="4767210" d="3032">and that everybody isn&#39;t an adversarial rapist.</p>
<p t="4770242" d="2458">So you know, you better balance out the story a little bit.</p>
<p t="4772700" d="4470">So the stories tell you how to act, but they also</p>
<p t="4777170" d="2530">tell you what the environment is.</p>
<p t="4779700" d="2330">No-- not environment.</p>
<p t="4782030" d="4350">They tell you how to conceptualize.</p>
<p t="4786380" d="3990">They model the nature of being-- that&#39;s the best way of thinking about</p>
<p t="4790370" d="1310">it-- actual being.</p>
<p t="4791680" d="2530">And in being is the social world.</p>
<p t="4794210" d="2190">How do you act in relationship to the social world?</p>
<p t="4796400" d="2510">Let me tell you a simpler story.</p>
<p t="4798910" d="1300">SPEAKER: Just to follow.</p>
<p t="4800210" d="1770">Isn&#39;t that-- what you&#39;re saying is, isn&#39;t</p>
<p t="4801980" d="2820">that different mythologies at different points of time</p>
<p t="4804800" d="4630">will tell you how to act under particular conditions</p>
<p t="4809430" d="2617">in which that society developed.</p>
<p t="4812047" d="833">JORDAN PETERSON: No.</p>
<p t="4812880" d="1450">No, no, it&#39;s broader than that.</p>
<p t="4814330" d="2980">It&#39;s broad-- it&#39;s broader-- well, look, I had a student once</p>
<p t="4817310" d="2610">who said, well, if these archetypes are true,</p>
<p t="4819920" d="3120">why don&#39;t we just tell the archetypal story over and over?</p>
<p t="4823040" d="2492">Why do we need like, literature?</p>
<p t="4825532" d="1958">I thought, well, that&#39;s a really good question.</p>
<p t="4827490" d="2660">And then I thought, well, for much of human history,</p>
<p t="4830150" d="3510">we just told the archetypal story over and over.</p>
<p t="4833660" d="1830">But then there&#39;s this tension.</p>
<p t="4835490" d="4260">So this is why I think that there&#39;s three persons in the Christian trinity.</p>
<p t="4839750" d="2040">It&#39;s like, there&#39;s the Holy Ghost-- we&#39;ll just</p>
<p t="4841790" d="1000">forget about him for a minute.</p>
<p t="4842790" d="1190">But there&#39;s God the Father.</p>
<p t="4843980" d="1200">That needs no explanation.</p>
<p t="4845180" d="2340">That&#39;s, you know, the benevolent element.</p>
<p t="4847520" d="660">Benevolent.</p>
<p t="4848180" d="1839">That&#39;s the Great Father.</p>
<p t="4850019" d="1041">And then there&#39;s the son.</p>
<p t="4851060" d="1280">That&#39;s the hero.</p>
<p t="4852340" d="4004">OK, but the hero is weird because there&#39;s this sort of logos hero</p>
<p t="4856344" d="1916">that&#39;s been there since the beginning of time.</p>
<p t="4858260" d="990">That&#39;s logos, right?</p>
<p t="4859250" d="810">That&#39;s the word.</p>
<p t="4860060" d="2460">And then there is Jesus Christ the carpenter.</p>
<p t="4862520" d="4290">He&#39;s this guy that lived in some little bitty irrelevant village</p>
<p t="4866810" d="3570">2,000 years ago and died young.</p>
<p t="4870380" d="1530">Why do you need him?</p>
<p t="4871910" d="5070">Well, it&#39;s because the universal isn&#39;t real till it&#39;s being made particular.</p>
<p t="4876980" d="3900">And what we are are particular manifestations of the universal.</p>
<p t="4880880" d="2910">And the particular and the universal are both important.</p>
<p t="4883790" d="2850">So the general pattern is crucial.</p>
<p t="4886640" d="2450">But so are the details.</p>
<p t="4889090" d="2700">So the archetype is a general pattern.</p>
<p t="4891790" d="1170">You know, it&#39;s not--</p>
<p t="4892960" d="2500">you have-- your religious task, in a sense,</p>
<p t="4895460" d="5030">is to figure out how to embody the archetype in actual time and space.</p>
<p t="4900490" d="1090">So it&#39;s a pattern.</p>
<p t="4901580" d="3110">But you know, you still have to fill in the details.</p>
<p t="4904690" d="2290">And it&#39;s not like the details are irrelevant.</p>
<p t="4906980" d="1261">They&#39;re really relevant.</p>
<p t="4908241" d="3249">SPEAKER: And are the details culturally and temporally specific in some cases.</p>
<p t="4911490" d="1060">JORDAN PETERSON: Yes, sure, sure.</p>
<p t="4912550" d="1220">SPEAKER: Is that why we have, let&#39;s say, that&#39;s</p>
<p t="4913770" d="2185">why we have Christ in the Christian tradition.</p>
<p t="4915955" d="1875">But we have Buddha in the Buddhist tradition.</p>
<p t="4917830" d="4640">The Hindu tradition has its own plethora with its own embodiments</p>
<p t="4922470" d="3600">of universal truth versus individual atman.</p>
<p t="4926070" d="4305">I mean, because the case you make for the power of the-- let&#39;s say,</p>
<p t="4930375" d="2875">the Christian archetype narrative is most familiar to is in the West,</p>
<p t="4933250" d="2700">whether it&#39;s George or otherwise.</p>
<p t="4935950" d="720">Are very--</p>
<p t="4936670" d="3690">JORDAN PETERSON: I also think that Christianity has the best--</p>
<p t="4940360" d="1980">the most thoroughly developed--</p>
<p t="4942340" d="2740">philosophy of evil.</p>
<p t="4945080" d="2490">So I think that&#39;s a big advantage.</p>
<p t="4947570" d="4920">So-- but yeah, I mean, if you think about religions as at least in part</p>
<p t="4952490" d="3060">variations of hero mythology-- which they are in part--</p>
<p t="4955550" d="5970">then it&#39;s a story that can be told 1,000 times in 1,000 ways.</p>
<p t="4961520" d="2610">I mean, that&#39;s what the movie is if it&#39;s an adventure movie.</p>
<p t="4964130" d="1760">It&#39;s always a hero myth of some sort.</p>
<p t="4965890" d="1510">I mean, Christ, they&#39;re--</p>
<p t="4967400" d="2320">the ones we have now are almost purely archetypal,</p>
<p t="4969720" d="2390">like all the superhero movies.</p>
<p t="4972110" d="2940">Those are archetypal right to the core.</p>
<p t="4975050" d="4170">And it&#39;s funny because I know a comic book artist or author who</p>
<p t="4979220" d="1980">writes Batman and Wolverine.</p>
<p t="4981200" d="7530">And there&#39;s a community that the comic figure serves.</p>
<p t="4988730" d="2430">So if it&#39;s Batman, and you&#39;re a writer for Batman,</p>
<p t="4991160" d="2700">you don&#39;t just get to do anything with Batman.</p>
<p t="4993860" d="1590">There are Batman rules.</p>
<p t="4995450" d="3240">And the whole community of Batman fans, they know the rules.</p>
<p t="4998690" d="3060">And so if you muck about with Batman, then they tell you.</p>
<p t="5001750" d="2610">So Batman is actually an archetype that&#39;s</p>
<p t="5004360" d="1780">been generated by the collective.</p>
<p t="5006140" d="500">Right?</p>
<p t="5006640" d="3510">And they all feel well, that&#39;s not quite right.</p>
<p t="5010150" d="3810">Well, how-- why do you feel that the story isn&#39;t quite right?</p>
<p t="5013960" d="2400">Well, the answer to that is it&#39;s like a platonic answer.</p>
<p t="5016360" d="1290">You know the story.</p>
<p t="5017650" d="2064">You just don&#39;t know that you know the story.</p>
<p t="5019714" d="2166">And so when someone tells you the story properly you</p>
<p t="5021880" d="1380">think, wow, that&#39;s the story.</p>
<p t="5023260" d="1290">It&#39;s like, lock in--</p>
<p t="5024550" d="1350">lock-- key in lock.</p>
<p t="5025900" d="1746">SPEAKER: Which is fascinating.</p>
<p t="5027646" d="2724">And is your argument, then, that we know it&#39;s right when</p>
<p t="5030370" d="1737">we see it because it&#39;s so ancient and--</p>
<p t="5032107" d="1083">JORDAN PETERSON: Oh, yeah.</p>
<p t="5033190" d="1440">SPEAKER: And ingrained in us on so many levels--</p>
<p t="5034630" d="427">JORDAN PETERSON: Absolutely.</p>
<p t="5035057" d="1313">SPEAKER: Biological and social, and--</p>
<p t="5036370" d="360">JORDAN PETERSON: Yeah.</p>
<p t="5036730" d="1380">And that&#39;s the other thing.</p>
<p t="5038110" d="4720">So there&#39;s-- Piaget had this idea of equilibration.</p>
<p t="5042830" d="2060">Man, it&#39;s a smart idea because Piaget--</p>
<p t="5044890" d="2910">I don&#39;t know if you know this or not, but the motivation--</p>
<p t="5047800" d="3570">Piaget&#39;s motivation-- was to bridge the gap between science and religion.</p>
<p t="5051370" d="2960">And he had very intense messianic experiences when he was a young man.</p>
<p t="5054330" d="500">Yeah.</p>
<p t="5054830" d="500">Yeah.</p>
<p t="5055330" d="1860">So no one ever teaches that about Piaget.</p>
<p t="5057190" d="2040">Piaget&#39;s way more interesting that you think.</p>
<p t="5059230" d="3730">Piaget was very interested in the origin of morality.</p>
<p t="5062960" d="4960">And he traced the origin of morality back, in some sense,</p>
<p t="5067920" d="2290">to the rules that govern social interactions.</p>
<p t="5070210" d="500">OK.</p>
<p t="5070710" d="3480">So you can think Piaget thought it really</p>
<p t="5074190" d="3600">got going once kids were able to play games</p>
<p t="5077790" d="2200">with each other that had a shared goal.</p>
<p t="5079990" d="500">OK.</p>
<p t="5080490" d="2670">So that was kind of Piaget&#39;s definition of a game.</p>
<p t="5083160" d="3900">It&#39;s like, there&#39;s a bunch of people cooperating and competing</p>
<p t="5087060" d="3114">in relationship to a mutually agreed upon goal.</p>
<p t="5090174" d="1416">So like a Monopoly game, you know.</p>
<p t="5091590" d="960">You want to get all the money.</p>
<p t="5092550" d="910">It&#39;s like, why?</p>
<p t="5093460" d="2730">Because everyone agrees that that&#39;s what we&#39;re doing.</p>
<p t="5096190" d="2786">So it&#39;s like that&#39;s an artificial dominance hierarchy.</p>
<p t="5098976" d="1374">We just whipped it up on the fly.</p>
<p t="5100350" d="1800">Here&#39;s the top value.</p>
<p t="5102150" d="769">We&#39;ll play it out.</p>
<p t="5102919" d="2791">So then we&#39;re playing with this kind of dominance hierarchy, right?</p>
<p t="5105710" d="2740">And you get all sorts of information about people doing that.</p>
<p t="5108450" d="3990">And you also, you know, clue yourself in to the nature</p>
<p t="5112440" d="2370">of dominance hierarchies and the way that they can be</p>
<p t="5114810" d="2190">constructed, even somewhat arbitrarily.</p>
<p t="5117000" d="6260">Now, what Piaget noted was that children could play together,</p>
<p t="5123260" d="3761">and they could get along, and they could pursue the goal.</p>
<p t="5127021" d="2749">But if you took them out when they were young, out of the context,</p>
<p t="5129770" d="2083">and you asked them what the rules were, well, they</p>
<p t="5131853" d="4217">didn&#39;t know because the rules were actually the behavioral patterns</p>
<p t="5136070" d="2670">that all the kids had agreed upon one way or another.</p>
<p t="5138740" d="4320">They didn&#39;t sit down, codify the rules, and then act them out.</p>
<p t="5143060" d="6270">They acted out a coherent action pattern, and then--</p>
<p t="5149330" d="1920">when pulled from that--</p>
<p t="5151250" d="2000">they couldn&#39;t articulate it.</p>
<p t="5153250" d="3850">That wasn&#39;t the level at which the knowledge was embodied.</p>
<p t="5157100" d="3330">Well, that&#39;s exactly what happened to us across the course of history.</p>
<p t="5160430" d="5100">It&#39;s like, we learned to act before we learned the rules for how we acted.</p>
<p t="5165530" d="3440">It&#39;s exactly the opposite of a rationalist perspective, by the way.</p>
<p t="5168970" d="2740">And Nietzsche was the first person to really point this out.</p>
<p t="5171710" d="3420">You know, he said that a philosophical-- a philosophy</p>
<p t="5175130" d="4140">is the unconscious confession of the philosopher.</p>
<p t="5179270" d="3770">And here you can think about this in terms of the story of Moses too.</p>
<p t="5183040" d="3930">It&#39;s like, Moses realizes the rules, right, because God gives them to him.</p>
<p t="5186970" d="3900">Well, before Moses gets the rules, he spends</p>
<p t="5190870" d="6252">like, years in the desert as judge, like all the Israelites</p>
<p t="5197122" d="1708">who are always scrapping with each other.</p>
<p t="5198830" d="916">They get into a fight.</p>
<p t="5199746" d="2324">They come to him and say, OK, who&#39;s right here?</p>
<p t="5202070" d="4620">And he&#39;s doing it like all day for years, adjudicating.</p>
<p t="5206690" d="8700">So his mind is assembling all of these instances of moral conflict.</p>
<p t="5215390" d="2850">And he couldn&#39;t recognize patterns.</p>
<p t="5218240" d="2970">Well, one day it&#39;s like, it&#39;s a blinding flash of illumination.</p>
<p t="5221210" d="1110">It&#39;s like, oh.</p>
<p t="5222320" d="2550">These are the rules that we&#39;re following.</p>
<p t="5224870" d="3570">It&#39;s the translation of the behavior of knowledge into abstraction.</p>
<p t="5228440" d="3360">Now, you know, Moses is a composite character although, you know,</p>
<p t="5231800" d="3330">there are many stories about the original law giver.</p>
<p t="5235130" d="1680">It&#39;s not the original law giver.</p>
<p t="5236810" d="3360">It&#39;s the original law observer.</p>
<p t="5240170" d="2080">Like, we&#39;re our own wolf pack.</p>
<p t="5242250" d="4820">We&#39;re anthropologists or ethnologists and wolf pack at the same time.</p>
<p t="5247070" d="2050">Oh here we are doing things.</p>
<p t="5249120" d="1650">What are we doing?</p>
<p t="5250770" d="1080">Well, we watch.</p>
<p t="5251850" d="1330">And we make stories out of it.</p>
<p t="5253180" d="1430">This is what we seem to be doing.</p>
<p t="5254610" d="1499">What do those stories mean?</p>
<p t="5256109" d="1291">This is what they seem to mean.</p>
<p t="5257400" d="2370">Oh, those are-- those are rules.</p>
<p t="5259770" d="3240">They&#39;re articulated descriptions of behavioral patterns.</p>
<p t="5263010" d="1502">We must be following them.</p>
<p t="5264512" d="1708">It&#39;s like, well, now we&#39;re following them</p>
<p t="5266220" d="1458">because we know what the rules are.</p>
<p t="5267678" d="5432">Before, we were just acting out the equivalent embodied pattern.</p>
<p t="5273110" d="3097">And you know, like, the conspiracy theorists,</p>
<p t="5276207" d="1833">you know, the people who say, well, you know</p>
<p t="5278040" d="2940">this is all about control by the upper classes, it&#39;s like,</p>
<p t="5280980" d="1860">they assume that you can just generate up</p>
<p t="5282840" d="2490">some arbitrary rules that happen to serve you, and then</p>
<p t="5285330" d="1490">enforce them on a community.</p>
<p t="5286820" d="2430">Well, no.</p>
<p t="5289250" d="3580">Partly, but fundamentally no.</p>
<p t="5292830" d="740">You know.</p>
<p t="5293570" d="3320">Because that&#39;s not-- that&#39;s not biological thinking.</p>
<p t="5296890" d="3750">You know, that&#39;s dawn of the industrial age thinking, or something like that,</p>
<p t="5300640" d="1770">or post agricultural thinking.</p>
<p t="5302410" d="1680">Who cares about that?</p>
<p t="5304090" d="2540">You know, let&#39;s go back to when we lived in trees.</p>
<p t="5306630" d="3250">We&#39;ll go back 60 million years, and start talking</p>
<p t="5309880" d="2460">about who we are from that perspective.</p>
<p t="5312340" d="1740">And that&#39;s just a start.</p>
<p t="5314080" d="2500">We&#39;re older than that.</p>
<p t="5316580" d="3560">So it&#39;s too-- it&#39;s way too narrow a view.</p>
<p t="5320140" d="3870">It&#39;s not informed by biological reality.</p>
<p t="5324010" d="2010">SPEAKER: So when you mentioned the Moses story</p>
<p t="5326020" d="2790">as law giver versus law observer--</p>
<p t="5328810" d="2400">and then I was thinking the actual biblical story</p>
<p t="5331210" d="4140">of where God speaks to Moses, then my inner Dawkins,</p>
<p t="5335350" d="4785">or my inner enlightenment rationalists is saying, OK, all well and good,</p>
<p t="5340135" d="3985">but why do you need this ridiculous sky figure who--</p>
<p t="5344120" d="2750">JORDAN PETERSON: He&#39;s a representation of the dominance hierarchy.</p>
<p t="5346870" d="970">That&#39;s the father.</p>
<p t="5347840" d="1790">It&#39;s like, why not--</p>
<p t="5349630" d="2220">OK.</p>
<p t="5351850" d="2280">Let&#39;s talk about that, what is it?</p>
<p t="5354130" d="2580">Agency detection module.</p>
<p t="5356710" d="3390">OK, first of all, that&#39;s a stupid way to conceptualize.</p>
<p t="5360100" d="2820">It is not an agency detection module.</p>
<p t="5362920" d="2970">It&#39;s not some little gadget that stuck to a computer.</p>
<p t="5365890" d="1151">It&#39;s really deep.</p>
<p t="5367041" d="499">OK.</p>
<p t="5367540" d="1830">So let&#39;s think about who we are.</p>
<p t="5369370" d="960">Monkeys.</p>
<p t="5370330" d="990">Where do we live?</p>
<p t="5371320" d="1440">In a dominance hierarchy.</p>
<p t="5372760" d="3120">What&#39;s a permanent element of the dominance hierarchy.</p>
<p t="5375880" d="1620">The dominance hierarchy.</p>
<p t="5377500" d="1090">What else?</p>
<p t="5378590" d="4771">Well, males, females, and you.</p>
<p t="5383361" d="499">OK.</p>
<p t="5383860" d="2850">So we&#39;re going to say, what&#39;s the world made out of?</p>
<p t="5386710" d="4250">Males, females, and you.</p>
<p t="5390960" d="1530">Why is the world made out of that?</p>
<p t="5392490" d="2250">Because no matter where you go, no matter</p>
<p t="5394740" d="5670">when, no matter how far back in time, those are things you can rely on.</p>
<p t="5400410" d="1740">So now we have this circuit.</p>
<p t="5402150" d="1420">It&#39;s the brain.</p>
<p t="5403570" d="1940">It&#39;s like, well, what are males like?</p>
<p t="5405510" d="1500">What are females like?</p>
<p t="5407010" d="1500">And what are we like?</p>
<p t="5408510" d="1210">And how do we interact?</p>
<p t="5409720" d="500">OK.</p>
<p t="5410220" d="2520">So there you get the constituent elements of reality.</p>
<p t="5412740" d="1590">So first of all, it&#39;s just social.</p>
<p t="5414330" d="4500">But it&#39;s complex because the males aren&#39;t just singular figures.</p>
<p t="5418830" d="3660">Like, the father isn&#39;t an individual.</p>
<p t="5422490" d="3630">The father is the whole patriarchal dominance hierarchy, right?</p>
<p t="5426120" d="2890">The individual is just a representation of that.</p>
<p t="5429010" d="4640">So our minds are more evolved to consider masculinity as such,</p>
<p t="5433650" d="2340">rather than the male individual.</p>
<p t="5435990" d="3270">Jung would say of Freud&#39;s problem patients</p>
<p t="5439260" d="3270">that they confused their own fathers with the masculine.</p>
<p t="5442530" d="2240">The masculine is like a god.</p>
<p t="5444770" d="1350">You say, well, is it a god?</p>
<p t="5446120" d="2260">It&#39;s like, well, it shapes your behavior.</p>
<p t="5448380" d="1980">It determines your destiny.</p>
<p t="5450360" d="2580">It determines your fitness.</p>
<p t="5452940" d="2020">Is it alive?</p>
<p t="5454960" d="2040">That&#39;s a good question.</p>
<p t="5457000" d="3341">Depends on how you describe alive.</p>
<p t="5460341" d="499">OK.</p>
<p t="5460840" d="2460">So we&#39;ve got this system that can recognize like,</p>
<p t="5463300" d="5790">the masculine living thing, the feminine living thing, the self living thing.</p>
<p t="5469090" d="5310">Well, that&#39;s the underlying pre-suppositions of our nervous system.</p>
<p t="5474400" d="1810">That&#39;s the world of being.</p>
<p t="5476210" d="500">OK.</p>
<p t="5476710" d="2580">At some point, our cortex inflates.</p>
<p t="5479290" d="2220">So now we can use abstraction.</p>
<p t="5481510" d="3210">But you know that evolution is a conservative process.</p>
<p t="5484720" d="2430">You don&#39;t just build a new thing.</p>
<p t="5487150" d="3150">You build a new thing on an old thing.</p>
<p t="5490300" d="2370">And so the new thing still thinks like the old thing.</p>
<p t="5492670" d="1750">But it can do some more things.</p>
<p t="5494420" d="3260">Well, so, what&#39;s happened to us--</p>
<p t="5497680" d="2160">and this is something that&#39;s amazing to me--</p>
<p t="5499840" d="3750">is that we&#39;ve taken these basic social cognitive categories,</p>
<p t="5503590" d="4950">and we&#39;ve been able to map being itself using the same categories.</p>
<p t="5508540" d="1500">And it works.</p>
<p t="5510040" d="3630">You map the masculine onto the dominance hierarchy.</p>
<p t="5513670" d="4430">You map the feminine on to nature.</p>
<p t="5518100" d="824">Well, that works.</p>
<p t="5518924" d="1166">All of a sudden, that works.</p>
<p t="5520090" d="2426">It&#39;s like, you can survive like that.</p>
<p t="5522516" d="1624">So you think, well, is that a metaphor?</p>
<p t="5524140" d="1370">It&#39;s like, no.</p>
<p t="5525510" d="1300">It&#39;s not a metaphor.</p>
<p t="5526810" d="2140">And here&#39;s an example.</p>
<p t="5528950" d="3226">Why is mother nature mother nature?</p>
<p t="5532176" d="1654">Well, what&#39;s nature?</p>
<p t="5533830" d="3710">Well, nature is that which selects.</p>
<p t="5537540" d="3480">That&#39;s like as far as I can tell, how else are you going to define nature.</p>
<p t="5541020" d="2250">Nature selects.</p>
<p t="5543270" d="2230">Women select.</p>
<p t="5545500" d="1500">I mean, that&#39;s what women do.</p>
<p t="5547000" d="900">Human women.</p>
<p t="5547900" d="1710">They&#39;re not like chimps.</p>
<p t="5549610" d="2190">They&#39;re selective maters.</p>
<p t="5551800" d="3270">So as far as men are concerned-- and maybe as far as women are concerned</p>
<p t="5555070" d="540">too--</p>
<p t="5555610" d="1420">women are nature.</p>
<p t="5557030" d="1970">It&#39;s not a metaphor.</p>
<p t="5559000" d="4820">It&#39;s like, they&#39;re the thing that stops you from reproducing, let&#39;s say.</p>
<p t="5563820" d="3240">And that&#39;s partly why they make you self-conscious when you reject it.</p>
<p t="5567060" d="2460">It&#39;s like, they&#39;re the portal to immortality.</p>
<p t="5569520" d="1500">That&#39;s another way of looking at it.</p>
<p t="5571020" d="1710">They are nature.</p>
<p t="5572730" d="1560">It&#39;s not like they represent it.</p>
<p t="5574290" d="3870">They are nature in the most direct possible way.</p>
<p t="5578160" d="3989">So like, is that a right way of looking at the world?</p>
<p t="5582149" d="2041">It&#39;s difficult to make an alternative case if you</p>
<p t="5584190" d="1630">think from a Darwinian perspective.</p>
<p t="5585820" d="2360">Now, there&#39;s a metaphorical element to it, too,</p>
<p t="5588180" d="2550">because you can also project it on that which</p>
<p t="5590730" d="4950">lies outside of the patriarchy, which is also why women get in trouble with men</p>
<p t="5595680" d="3510">sometimes, because men can easily get confused, right?</p>
<p t="5599190" d="2422">It&#39;s easy for women to be the chaotic thing that</p>
<p t="5601612" d="1208">doesn&#39;t fit in the hierarchy.</p>
<p t="5602820" d="2130">And women are always complaining about that, right?</p>
<p t="5604950" d="1170">And as they should.</p>
<p t="5606120" d="1620">It&#39;s a constant battle.</p>
<p t="5607740" d="3660">But what&#39;s happened for better or worse is</p>
<p t="5611400" d="2610">that we&#39;ve been able to take that initial social cognitive</p>
<p t="5614010" d="3150">architecture to build a system of abstraction</p>
<p t="5617160" d="4960">on top of that to use the same basic categories to explain how to behave.</p>
<p t="5622120" d="1130">And it worked.</p>
<p t="5623250" d="2340">So it&#39;s mind boggling.</p>
<p t="5625590" d="2640">It&#39;s mind boggling to me that that works.</p>
<p t="5628230" d="3330">SPEAKER: Are you familiar with the theories of embodied cognition,</p>
<p t="5631560" d="6175">and like, George Lakoff, and his metaphor theory of thought, basically.</p>
<p t="5637735" d="875">JORDAN PETERSON: Mhm.</p>
<p t="5638610" d="1410">Sure.</p>
<p t="5640020" d="2541">SPEAKER: I think what you&#39;re saying is the same thing, right?</p>
<p t="5642561" d="3069">We have these categories that emerge from our lived experience</p>
<p t="5645630" d="1494">as humans in our human embodiment.</p>
<p t="5647124" d="1666">JORDAN PETERSON: Sure, absolutely, yeah.</p>
<p t="5648790" d="500">Yeah.</p>
<p t="5649290" d="3660">SPEAKER: And because these are actually the only tools we have,</p>
<p t="5652950" d="3950">we use them in recombination with each other with themselves</p>
<p t="5656900" d="1930">if necessary in modification.</p>
<p t="5658830" d="3180">But we use them as ways of making sense of the world.</p>
<p t="5662010" d="4697">Even our scientific models are predicated on the embodied experience--</p>
<p t="5666707" d="2083">JORDAN PETERSON: Yeah, well, that&#39;s a tougher one.</p>
<p t="5668790" d="5430">That&#39;s a tougher one because I do think that science does have a qualitative.</p>
<p t="5674220" d="1830">There&#39;s a qualitative difference.</p>
<p t="5676050" d="4370">It is in some sense stepping outside of the mythological framework, you know.</p>
<p t="5680420" d="3130">And it&#39;s because it&#39;s this really powerful technique,</p>
<p t="5683550" d="4230">it&#39;s like, OK, what is the nature of our shared experience?</p>
<p t="5687780" d="2340">Now, that&#39;s not exactly what science is about.</p>
<p t="5690120" d="6410">It&#39;s more like, if we behave in such a way, something will happen.</p>
<p t="5696530" d="3600">We&#39;re going to interpret that from a subjective perspective,</p>
<p t="5700130" d="2400">like a personal perspective, let&#39;s say.</p>
<p t="5702530" d="2610">But what happens if we get 100 people to do that,</p>
<p t="5705140" d="4590">and they all observe the outcome, and then they all tell a story about it,</p>
<p t="5709730" d="2600">and then we take what&#39;s common across the stories?</p>
<p t="5712330" d="4230">It&#39;s, like oh, well, that&#39;s interesting.</p>
<p t="5716560" d="3200">We get a new way of describing things.</p>
<p t="5719760" d="4340">Well, is that true?</p>
<p t="5724100" d="4040">Well, then you get back into the problem of what constitutes truth.</p>
<p t="5728140" d="1770">Is it useful?</p>
<p t="5729910" d="3590">That-- we also don&#39;t know that because we don&#39;t have the time</p>
<p t="5733500" d="2140">frame across which to analyze it yet.</p>
<p t="5735640" d="5100">Like, we&#39;re staking our survival on the presupposition that it&#39;s useful.</p>
<p t="5740740" d="2980">But it&#39;s like, you know, there wouldn&#39;t be</p>
<p t="5743720" d="4090">constant bouts of apocalyptic thinking if we didn&#39;t have our doubts about it.</p>
<p t="5747810" d="500">Right?</p>
<p t="5748310" d="4640">And it&#39;s certainly an anomaly in the natural world.</p>
<p t="5752950" d="1934">But no one no other creature has science.</p>
<p t="5754884" d="1916">It&#39;s like, they did perfectly well without it.</p>
<p t="5756800" d="2040">Maybe science is fatal.</p>
<p t="5758840" d="2770">I mean, it could easily be fatal.</p>
<p t="5761610" d="5910">So you know, and someone who&#39;s a scientist</p>
<p t="5767520" d="4320">in that sort of ideological sense would say, well, even if it&#39;s fatal,</p>
<p t="5771840" d="1190">it was still true.</p>
<p t="5773030" d="3280">It&#39;s like, well, it depends on how you define truth.</p>
<p t="5776310" d="6970">Like, if you&#39;re willing to say that fatal is true, well, then go ahead.</p>
<p t="5783280" d="2280">But I think that&#39;s not a good definition of truth.</p>
<p t="5785560" d="2760">And that&#39;s where our disagreement really lies.</p>
<p t="5788320" d="1330">You have your definition.</p>
<p t="5789650" d="1440">I have my definition.</p>
<p t="5791090" d="2980">I think my definition is Darwinian.</p>
<p t="5794070" d="2730">So you have to contend with that if you&#39;re a scientist.</p>
<p t="5796800" d="3090">But you might dispute that. although it&#39;s not clear to me</p>
<p t="5799890" d="1760">how you would dispute that.</p>
<p t="5801650" d="3250">But well, we&#39;ve already run through that argument.</p>
<p t="5804900" d="2130">It gets tangled up at the bottom, you know.</p>
<p t="5807030" d="3630">And I also think part of the problem with strictly--</p>
<p t="5810660" d="5220">with the view that only what is objectively observable is real--</p>
<p t="5815880" d="3180">which, you can have a science without that presupposition.</p>
<p t="5819060" d="5760">You could say only what is objectively true is uniquely useful and valuable.</p>
<p t="5824820" d="4080">But it&#39;s part of a bunch of things that are uniquely useful and valuable.</p>
<p t="5828900" d="1560">But let&#39;s not discount it.</p>
<p t="5830460" d="1000">It&#39;s also dangerous.</p>
<p t="5831460" d="1970">So we got to keep an eye on it, you know.</p>
<p t="5833430" d="1800">It&#39;s a big tool.</p>
<p t="5835230" d="3210">Well, that&#39;s a perfectly reasonable thing to do.</p>
<p t="5838440" d="3032">What-- do you take the next step and you say, only that.</p>
<p t="5841472" d="1708">Well, then I also think another way, it&#39;s</p>
<p t="5843180" d="2250">like, why are you claiming only that?</p>
<p t="5845430" d="3170">You say, well, it&#39;s because I&#39;m pursuing truth.</p>
<p t="5848600" d="3730">And I think, oh, you&#39;re sure about that, are you?</p>
<p t="5852330" d="2250">You actually think that like, you&#39;re on this-- you&#39;re</p>
<p t="5854580" d="3870">sure that you&#39;re on this pristine path.</p>
<p t="5858450" d="2419">And all those other people who aren&#39;t, they&#39;re deluded</p>
<p t="5860869" d="1541">or there&#39;s something wrong with them.</p>
<p t="5862410" d="2760">But you, you&#39;re on this pristine path.</p>
<p t="5865170" d="1402">You&#39;re so sure of that.</p>
<p t="5866572" d="2708">I don&#39;t think you know anything about yourself if you think that.</p>
<p t="5872610" d="2370">All scientists are devoted to the truth.</p>
<p t="5874980" d="1110">What truth?</p>
<p t="5876090" d="3060">Maybe they&#39;re devoted to the purpose of demonstrating</p>
<p t="5879150" d="2160">that there&#39;s no meaning in life so that they don&#39;t</p>
<p t="5881310" d="2460">have to bear any moral responsibility.</p>
<p t="5883770" d="1170">It&#39;s like, why not that?</p>
<p t="5884940" d="1410">Oh, we wouldn&#39;t think that.</p>
<p t="5886350" d="1740">It&#39;s like, well, I&#39;m a psychoanalyst.</p>
<p t="5888090" d="4410">I might think that because whenever anybody says to me I believe x,</p>
<p t="5892500" d="5630">I think, what does that allow you not to believe?</p>
<p t="5898130" d="1000">I&#39;m for x.</p>
<p t="5899130" d="1350">What are you against?</p>
<p t="5900480" d="1740">Well, I&#39;ve thought about this a lot.</p>
<p t="5902220" d="5580">It&#39;s like, oh, it&#39;s a catastrophe that the war between science and religion</p>
<p t="5907800" d="3750">blows our capacity to believe in transcendent meaning.</p>
<p t="5911550" d="3030">It demolishes our ability to believe in transcendent meaning.</p>
<p t="5914580" d="2910">Isn&#39;t that a catastrophe, sort of the Nietzschean viewpoint?</p>
<p t="5917490" d="4110">It&#39;s like, I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s a catastrophe because then I think,</p>
<p t="5921600" d="2550">all right, well, under what conditions would you</p>
<p t="5924150" d="3560">be motivated to accept that catastrophe?</p>
<p t="5927710" d="3690">Well, you could you say your life is meaningful.</p>
<p t="5931400" d="2220">But meaning comes at a price.</p>
<p t="5933620" d="2610">The price is basically moral.</p>
<p t="5936230" d="4590">And part of that moral price is truth and responsibility.</p>
<p t="5940820" d="1500">You have to bear that.</p>
<p t="5942320" d="540">OK.</p>
<p t="5942860" d="1375">It&#39;s like, yeah, you get meaning.</p>
<p t="5944235" d="2525">But now you&#39;ve got some work to do.</p>
<p t="5946760" d="2400">You don&#39;t get to regard your actions as trivial.</p>
<p t="5949160" d="2970">You don&#39;t get to rationalize your errors of speech</p>
<p t="5952130" d="5100">as casual and forgivable-- none of that.</p>
<p t="5957230" d="2190">You get the whole burden that goes with meaning.</p>
<p t="5959420" d="1890">Or you can say, well, nothing&#39;s meaningful.</p>
<p t="5961310" d="3330">Well, Dostoevsky figured this out a long time ago.</p>
<p t="5964640" d="4560">If there is no god, there&#39;s no moral values, everything is permitted.</p>
<p t="5969200" d="2280">It&#39;s like, OK, maybe that&#39;s what you want.</p>
<p t="5971480" d="2550">Maybe your whole argument--</p>
<p t="5974030" d="2250">even though you don&#39;t know it--</p>
<p t="5976280" d="3840">maybe that whole argument of which you&#39;re only a part of</p>
<p t="5980120" d="4530">is actually predicated on the desire to demolish the necessity for truth</p>
<p t="5984650" d="1930">and responsibility.</p>
<p t="5986580" d="1400">Well, you could say, no.</p>
<p t="5987980" d="2190">It&#39;s like, OK, but you know.</p>
<p t="5990170" d="3300">It&#39;s not like science has always been put to purposes</p>
<p t="5993470" d="1950">that we would regard as ethical.</p>
<p t="5995420" d="2760">And then you also have to ask, well, what</p>
<p t="5998180" d="1980">allows us to ask the question of whether or not</p>
<p t="6000160" d="2610">science is put to ethical purposes?</p>
<p t="6002770" d="1770">What&#39;s the framework for evaluation?</p>
<p t="6004540" d="2160">Well, it&#39;s not scientific.</p>
<p t="6006700" d="1647">Well, does it exist?</p>
<p t="6008347" d="1493">Hmm.</p>
<p t="6009840" d="3510">Solzhenitsyn said something interesting about the Nuremberg judgment.</p>
<p t="6013350" d="3630">Because he thought of that as like a pinnacle event in the 20th century.</p>
<p t="6016980" d="2335">And I can understand this because--</p>
<p t="6022570" d="2190">like, you know, there&#39;s this Cartesian--</p>
<p t="6024760" d="1470">one of the things Descartes did--</p>
<p t="6026230" d="2291">hypothetically-- was to try to doubt everything till he</p>
<p t="6028521" d="1519">found something he couldn&#39;t doubt.</p>
<p t="6030040" d="2640">And what he couldn&#39;t doubt was the fact that he thinks.</p>
<p t="6032680" d="1500">Now, that&#39;s a translation.</p>
<p t="6034180" d="2700">So I don&#39;t really know if he meant, I think.</p>
<p t="6036880" d="3480">Whatever, he had this process of radical doubt.</p>
<p t="6040360" d="2640">Well, I did that too before I wrote Maps of Meaning,</p>
<p t="6043000" d="2170">except I didn&#39;t know that Descartes had done it.</p>
<p t="6045170" d="2810">I was trying to think, what do I actually believe?</p>
<p t="6047980" d="3270">What&#39;s unassailably true for me.</p>
<p t="6051250" d="2500">And I thought, pain.</p>
<p t="6053750" d="1400">Pain is true.</p>
<p t="6055150" d="810">It&#39;s really hard.</p>
<p t="6055960" d="1620">You can&#39;t argue yourself out of pain.</p>
<p t="6057580" d="2280">It&#39;s like, when it happens, it&#39;s real.</p>
<p t="6059860" d="2280">No matter what you say about subjectivity, it&#39;s like,</p>
<p t="6062140" d="1333">you&#39;re running around screaming.</p>
<p t="6063473" d="1557">So who cares what you say.</p>
<p t="6065030" d="4910">Then I thought, well, the infliction of pain is real.</p>
<p t="6069940" d="3240">And then I thought, well, and pain is-- like, pain is unpleasant.</p>
<p t="6073180" d="3360">It&#39;s got that quality about it.</p>
<p t="6076540" d="1950">You know, I-- so that was good.</p>
<p t="6078490" d="2790">And then there was another process of argumentation</p>
<p t="6081280" d="3510">that led me to conclude that what constituted evil</p>
<p t="6084790" d="4080">was the infliction of unnecessary pain.</p>
<p t="6088870" d="3270">And for me, like, so, not only, like, if I&#39;m really evil,</p>
<p t="6092140" d="2740">I&#39;m going to inflict pain in a way that not only damages whoever</p>
<p t="6094880" d="2570">I&#39;m inflicting, it also damages me.</p>
<p t="6097450" d="1047">And that&#39;s fine.</p>
<p t="6098497" d="1833">It&#39;s like the shootings in the high schools.</p>
<p t="6100330" d="3510">It&#39;s like, why don&#39;t they just shoot themselves to begin with?</p>
<p t="6103840" d="1410">Why go to all the trouble?</p>
<p t="6105250" d="2369">Well, try answering that.</p>
<p t="6107619" d="2791">You should read some of the writings of the Columbine killers, man.</p>
<p t="6110410" d="3120">They&#39;ll make the hair on the back of your neck stand up.</p>
<p t="6113530" d="3310">You know, it&#39;s-- you cannot believe what those kids wrote.</p>
<p t="6116840" d="3080">It&#39;s uncanny what they were thinking.</p>
<p t="6119920" d="1230">Truly.</p>
<p t="6121150" d="2430">So well, they&#39;re motivated by something.</p>
<p t="6123580" d="1170">Well, what?</p>
<p t="6124750" d="3430">Well, it&#39;s something Satanic from an archetypal perspective.</p>
<p t="6128180" d="500">You know.</p>
<p t="6128680" d="3450">So for me, what ended up at the bottom of reality was</p>
<p t="6132130" d="3330">it&#39;s wrong to inflict unnecessary pain.</p>
<p t="6135460" d="5370">So pain, even that doesn&#39;t serve your own purposes even.</p>
<p t="6140830" d="2010">That&#39;s the Nuremberg judgment, fundamentally.</p>
<p t="6142840" d="2610">It&#39;s like, there are things that are wrong.</p>
<p t="6145450" d="1290">OK.</p>
<p t="6146740" d="3120">Are you gonna accept that or not?</p>
<p t="6149860" d="3030">Well, if you accept that, there is a place you go.</p>
<p t="6152890" d="3560">And if you don&#39;t accept that, there is another place you go.</p>
<p t="6156450" d="3580">And we already saw what happened when people go to that place.</p>
<p t="6160030" d="5190">And so you can say, well, that&#39;s irrelevant.</p>
<p t="6165220" d="1470">OK.</p>
<p t="6166690" d="1350">Fine.</p>
<p t="6168040" d="1740">You pay the price for your belief.</p>
<p t="6169780" d="2940">So will other people.</p>
<p t="6172720" d="2480">And so that&#39;s why Solzhenitsyn is at least in part</p>
<p t="6175200" d="1570">an admired of the Nuremberg judgment.</p>
<p t="6176770" d="5570">It&#39;s like, there are things that are archetipally evil.</p>
<p t="6182340" d="3030">You don&#39;t get to escape from them because of culture.</p>
<p t="6185370" d="2490">You don&#39;t get to escape from them because</p>
<p t="6187860" d="3030">of the particulars of the situation.</p>
<p t="6190890" d="6350">Well, you could make a strong case that that&#39;s victor talk and revenge.</p>
<p t="6197240" d="840">Fair enough.</p>
<p t="6198080" d="4520">But when I wandered through the Holocaust literature,</p>
<p t="6202600" d="3840">and the literature on the Japanese invasion of China,</p>
<p t="6206440" d="3150">and the literature on the Stalinist camps,</p>
<p t="6209590" d="2440">that was sufficiently convincing for me.</p>
<p t="6212030" d="2200">It&#39;s like, no.</p>
<p t="6214230" d="930">Not there.</p>
<p t="6215160" d="2380">That&#39;s not the right place to go.</p>
<p t="6217540" d="1520">Is that a scientific judgment?</p>
<p t="6219060" d="2140">No.</p>
<p t="6221200" d="3500">SPEAKER 1: But from your own logic, if I understand it correctly,</p>
<p t="6224700" d="6550">you&#39;re saying that your judgment is predicated on your existence as a human</p>
<p t="6231250" d="2850">in a dominance hierarchy, and that&#39;s what makes that judgment--</p>
<p t="6234100" d="5760">the fact that this sort of behavior is wrong true because of the biological</p>
<p t="6239860" d="1724">context almost--</p>
<p t="6241584" d="916">JORDAN PETERSON: Sure.</p>
<p t="6242500" d="580">It&#39;s deep.</p>
<p t="6243080" d="410">SPEAKER 1: --in which you&#39;re embedded.</p>
<p t="6243490" d="916">JORDAN PETERSON: Yeah.</p>
<p t="6244406" d="4814">Well, it&#39;s more than that because as an individual, I&#39;m an individual.</p>
<p t="6249220" d="2550">But as a human, I&#39;m not an individual at all.</p>
<p t="6251770" d="2400">I&#39;m this unbelievably old thing.</p>
<p t="6254170" d="2310">I&#39;m like, as old as life.</p>
<p t="6256480" d="1560">I&#39;m really old.</p>
<p t="6258040" d="3180">Well, there&#39;s the &quot;me&quot; in this, which is this thing that</p>
<p t="6261220" d="2790">was like come around in 1962.</p>
<p t="6264010" d="5040">But there&#39;s the deeper reality of this thing that I am.</p>
<p t="6269050" d="2100">You could say, well, that&#39;s the Jungian self.</p>
<p t="6271150" d="2260">That&#39;s one way of looking at it.</p>
<p t="6273410" d="2150">And it has its nature.</p>
<p t="6275560" d="1620">It&#39;s the human nature.</p>
<p t="6277180" d="2430">Well, good and evil are human terms.</p>
<p t="6279610" d="2294">Whether we refer to something transcendent,</p>
<p t="6281904" d="1416">that&#39;s a whole different question.</p>
<p t="6283320" d="2710">That is not a simple question because we don&#39;t know</p>
<p t="6286030" d="3060">what role consciousness plays in being.</p>
<p t="6289090" d="6090">So like the deepest strata of thought that I&#39;ve encountered</p>
<p t="6295180" d="3870">makes the case that the most real thing is the eternal battle</p>
<p t="6299050" d="1380">between good and evil.</p>
<p t="6300430" d="2800">And I&#39;m prone to believe that.</p>
<p t="6303230" d="5160">So what exactly that means, that&#39;s a different story.</p>
<p t="6308390" d="1550">It&#39;s a complicated idea.</p>
<p t="6309940" d="4590">SPEAKER 1: So the inner materialist in my brain</p>
<p t="6314530" d="4500">now is saying that&#39;s a confusion of facts and values.</p>
<p t="6319030" d="4070">But what I&#39;m assuming that you would say back--</p>
<p t="6323100" d="2140">and correct me and tell m what you would say back.</p>
<p t="6325240" d="3870">Even as a materialist scientist, you, yourself,</p>
<p t="6329110" d="3232">are a human participating in this human drama.</p>
<p t="6332342" d="958">JORDAN PETERSON: Right.</p>
<p t="6333300" d="1720">SPEAKER 1: You&#39;re mistaking what&#39;s embedded in what.</p>
<p t="6335020" d="240">JORDAN PETERSON: Yes.</p>
<p t="6335260" d="720">That&#39;s right.</p>
<p t="6335980" d="1260">That&#39;s exactly right.</p>
<p t="6337240" d="660">That&#39;s right.</p>
<p t="6337900" d="1470">Because that&#39;s the question.</p>
<p t="6339370" d="5600">Objective reality, mythology, one proposition.</p>
<p t="6344970" d="4050">Mythology, objective reality, another proposition.</p>
<p t="6349020" d="1600">That&#39;s my proposition.</p>
<p t="6350620" d="3260">It&#39;s like, this is way deeper than this.</p>
<p t="6353880" d="1930">It&#39;s incomparably deeper.</p>
<p t="6355810" d="2540">Now, that doesn&#39;t mean this isn&#39;t deep.</p>
<p t="6358350" d="870">It&#39;s deep.</p>
<p t="6359220" d="4530">But it&#39;s sterile.</p>
<p t="6363750" d="930">And that&#39;s dangerous.</p>
<p t="6364680" d="2640">And then when you forget which is embedded in which,</p>
<p t="6367320" d="1710">then you make mistakes.</p>
<p t="6369030" d="3480">It&#39;s like, yeah, well why not cross Ebola with smallpox?</p>
<p t="6372510" d="1980">Well, that&#39;s a good question.</p>
<p t="6374490" d="2980">Why not do it?</p>
<p t="6377470" d="3870">Well, you know, a rationalist would say, well, I&#39;m</p>
<p t="6381340" d="1740">capable of making that judgment.</p>
<p t="6383080" d="1500">OK, well, let&#39;s really specify that.</p>
<p t="6384580" d="3240">What exactly do you mean that you&#39;re capable of making that judgment?</p>
<p t="6387820" d="3990">Because again, with Dawkins and his ilk, they</p>
<p t="6391810" d="3000">make the claim that they can have their cake and eat it, too.</p>
<p t="6394810" d="3420">So they can have all the benefits of an evolved morality, which is basically</p>
<p t="6398230" d="2150">a Judeo-Christian morality in the West.</p>
<p t="6400380" d="1750">And they can say, well, yeah, but we don&#39;t</p>
<p t="6402130" d="2540">have to accept any of the metaphysical presumptions.</p>
<p t="6404670" d="3060">It&#39;s like, says who?</p>
<p t="6407730" d="690">Yeah.</p>
<p t="6408420" d="4640">You could be right, but why would you assume that you are?</p>
<p t="6413060" d="2820">This is Nietzsche&#39;s point, maybe the metaphysical presuppositions</p>
<p t="6415880" d="2330">are absolutely necessary.</p>
<p t="6418210" d="2330">SPEAKER 1: And the question then is, as understood</p>
<p t="6420540" d="6010">by the millennia old individuals or cultures that gave birth to them,</p>
<p t="6426550" d="4971">or reinterpreted as preconscious symbology?</p>
<p t="6431521" d="999">You see what I&#39;m saying?</p>
<p t="6432520" d="833">JORDAN PETERSON: No.</p>
<p t="6433353" d="657">Not exactly.</p>
<p t="6434010" d="1282">You have to specify that more.</p>
<p t="6435292" d="708">SPEAKER 1: Right.</p>
<p t="6436000" d="2010">Because then Dawkins might say--</p>
<p t="6438010" d="3220">or I&#39;ll try not to pick on him.</p>
<p t="6441230" d="6600">But then the materialist, positivist, rationalist might say, OK,</p>
<p t="6447830" d="3750">but what does it mean to accept that mythology or to accept the metaphysics?</p>
<p t="6451580" d="7500">Does it mean that I have to believe that there is this omnipresent, sadistic god</p>
<p t="6459080" d="5890">who pits nations against each other and orders you to murder your neighboring</p>
<p t="6464970" d="1200">tribe?</p>
<p t="6466170" d="6255">Or rather, is it necessary to accept the metaphysical background,</p>
<p t="6472425" d="2595">or the substrate if you will--</p>
<p t="6475020" d="3237">as understood now as [INAUDIBLE]--</p>
<p t="6478257" d="1083">JORDAN PETERSON: Symbolic.</p>
<p t="6479340" d="5544">SPEAKER 1: --imagery from a culture that had no other means of articulating it?</p>
<p t="6484884" d="1666">Because then they might say, well, sure.</p>
<p t="6486550" d="5720">I can accept that it had some value in its time and place.</p>
<p t="6492270" d="1200">JORDAN PETERSON: OK.</p>
<p t="6493470" d="2130">That&#39;s where the problem would start for me.</p>
<p t="6495600" d="1980">It&#39;s still that time and place.</p>
<p t="6497580" d="1650">You get this idea, too--</p>
<p t="6499230" d="1740">the evolutionary psychologists do this--</p>
<p t="6503880" d="3180">where are we evolved with the African savanna?</p>
<p t="6507060" d="1810">And our moral systems are adapt--</p>
<p t="6508870" d="1490">It&#39;s like, why?</p>
<p t="6510360" d="1350">Why there?</p>
<p t="6511710" d="4920">Like, why not in the oceans 300 million years ago?</p>
<p t="6516630" d="4050">Why is that the preferential place from which our values are derived?</p>
<p t="6520680" d="1500">The rest of it&#39;s just nothing.</p>
<p t="6522180" d="1530">It&#39;s like, I don&#39;t understand that.</p>
<p t="6523710" d="1440">It makes no sense to me at all.</p>
<p t="6525150" d="3189">Well, you could say that&#39;s where we differentiated from chimps.</p>
<p t="6528339" d="1041">It&#39;s like, well, so what?</p>
<p t="6529380" d="3660">We&#39;re not that different from chimps, so what about the chimps?</p>
<p t="6533040" d="1830">They share a lot in common with us.</p>
<p t="6534870" d="2220">They didn&#39;t go through the savanna.</p>
<p t="6537090" d="4290">So the idea that these values, say, are shallow.</p>
<p t="6541380" d="2546">I mean, if you put it in an evolutionary basis</p>
<p t="6543926" d="1624">and you go back to the African savanna.</p>
<p t="6545550" d="958">Well, that&#39;s something.</p>
<p t="6546508" d="1862">It&#39;s a few million years, anyways.</p>
<p t="6548370" d="3270">But to me, that&#39;s still icing on the cake.</p>
<p t="6551640" d="930">It&#39;s not deep enough.</p>
<p t="6552570" d="1290">This is way deeper.</p>
<p t="6553860" d="1590">Now, the metaphysics.</p>
<p t="6555450" d="2220">OK, well, let&#39;s talk about the metaphysics.</p>
<p t="6557670" d="3250">OK, who&#39;s idea of God are you talking about?</p>
<p t="6560920" d="3530">It&#39;s like is God an old man with a beard and he lives in the sky?</p>
<p t="6564450" d="2760">OK, well, let&#39;s take that argument apart a little bit.</p>
<p t="6567210" d="3780">OK, first of all, the ancient Jews, they didn&#39;t like you to say the name of God.</p>
<p t="6570990" d="2160">Why Because they didn&#39;t want you to confuse</p>
<p t="6573150" d="2190">the representation with the phenomena.</p>
<p t="6575340" d="3620">So whatever was real for them was something beyond words.</p>
<p t="6578960" d="880">OK.</p>
<p t="6579840" d="5110">The same thing obtains with Taoism.</p>
<p t="6584950" d="1470">Same idea, right?</p>
<p t="6586420" d="3280">Don&#39;t make a graven image because you confuse the damn image with the thing.</p>
<p t="6589700" d="830">What&#39;s the thing?</p>
<p t="6590530" d="2430">It&#39;s that which is beyond imaging.</p>
<p t="6592960" d="3010">Does that which is beyond imaging exist?</p>
<p t="6595970" d="1010">Obviously.</p>
<p t="6596980" d="1890">What&#39;s its nature?</p>
<p t="6598870" d="2040">Well, that&#39;s a different question.</p>
<p t="6600910" d="3180">Now, in the Old Testament, its nature is arbitrary.</p>
<p t="6604090" d="2070">It&#39;s like, look the hell out.</p>
<p t="6606160" d="1530">You&#39;re going to get swatted down.</p>
<p t="6607690" d="2666">But if you look carefully at the structure of the Old Testament,</p>
<p t="6610356" d="2494">and Northrop Frye did this.</p>
<p t="6612850" d="1680">Frye&#39;s argument was basically this.</p>
<p t="6614530" d="1666">Well, you&#39;ve got the really old stories.</p>
<p t="6616196" d="764">Forget about them.</p>
<p t="6616960" d="2880">History starts, basically, with Abraham.</p>
<p t="6619840" d="2010">What is the Old Testament about?</p>
<p t="6621850" d="2190">The Israelites climb up to dominance.</p>
<p t="6624040" d="1020">They get corrupt.</p>
<p t="6625060" d="2280">They forget about the widows and the children.</p>
<p t="6627340" d="2310">A prophet comes up and says, you better look out.</p>
<p t="6629650" d="1080">You&#39;re off the path.</p>
<p t="6630730" d="1060">They ignore him.</p>
<p t="6631790" d="1040">Whap.</p>
<p t="6632830" d="2790">They&#39;re in chaos for like a long time.</p>
<p t="6635620" d="2724">They get all humble and they build themselves up again.</p>
<p t="6638344" d="1916">And when they get power, they get all corrupt.</p>
<p t="6640260" d="2770">And a prophet comes along and says, you better look out.</p>
<p t="6643030" d="1172">You&#39;re off the path.</p>
<p t="6644202" d="2458">You&#39;re not paying attention to the widows and the children,</p>
<p t="6646660" d="1500">and all hell&#39;s going to break loose.</p>
<p t="6648160" d="1350">Like, bang, down they go.</p>
<p t="6649510" d="960">Six times.</p>
<p t="6650470" d="780">Six times.</p>
<p t="6655410" d="4350">Is that arbitrary, or is that actually the right idea to derive from history?</p>
<p t="6659760" d="2380">It&#39;s like, power corrupts.</p>
<p t="6662140" d="1230">So you make your kingdom.</p>
<p t="6663370" d="900">You make your empire.</p>
<p t="6664270" d="3660">And it&#39;s serving its proper purpose, but you let it get corrupt.</p>
<p t="6667930" d="2010">Things are going to fall apart.</p>
<p t="6669940" d="1750">So I can give you an example of that.</p>
<p t="6671690" d="5865">It&#39;s like, what caused the flooding in New Orleans?</p>
<p t="6677555" d="1485">A hurricane?</p>
<p t="6679040" d="2710">No.</p>
<p t="6681750" d="2277">No, corruption.</p>
<p t="6684027" d="1833">If the dikes would have been built properly,</p>
<p t="6685860" d="3840">as everyone knew they should have been built. If all those millions of dollars</p>
<p t="6689700" d="2850">hadn&#39;t gone into the pockets of corrupt politicians,</p>
<p t="6692550" d="1830">there wouldn&#39;t have been any flood.</p>
<p t="6694380" d="5550">In Holland, they build the dikes for the worst storm in 10,000 years.</p>
<p t="6699930" d="3510">In New Orleans, they built them for the worst storm in 100 years.</p>
<p t="6703440" d="2350">Well everyone knew that was insufficient.</p>
<p t="6705790" d="2100">So why didn&#39;t they do something about it?</p>
<p t="6707890" d="3890">Well, if you get corrupt enough, God will send a flood.</p>
<p t="6711780" d="2340">It&#39;s like it&#39;s an old story.</p>
<p t="6714120" d="1870">It&#39;s right.</p>
<p t="6715990" d="2130">Now, the question is, who is God?</p>
<p t="6718120" d="5850">Well, I would say the ancient Israelites never made--</p>
<p t="6723970" d="2130">they never said who God was.</p>
<p t="6726100" d="2730">They just said, look the hell out for him.</p>
<p t="6728830" d="1560">You deviate from the path.</p>
<p t="6730390" d="1980">Man, you&#39;re going to get flattened.</p>
<p t="6732370" d="2160">The people who wrote that book--</p>
<p t="6734530" d="3570">first of all, it was assembled loosely as a book.</p>
<p t="6738100" d="1100">It&#39;s a bunch of books.</p>
<p t="6739200" d="1660">That&#39;s what Bible means.</p>
<p t="6740860" d="3000">It was edited and assembled across vast stretches of time.</p>
<p t="6743860" d="3030">We have no idea what process led people to assemble it that way,</p>
<p t="6746890" d="3110">except that they felt that that made sense.</p>
<p t="6750000" d="3010">So they were guided by their internal intuition of meaning.</p>
<p t="6753010" d="3990">Weirdly enough, it produced a document with a narrative.</p>
<p t="6757000" d="3920">Now, the narrative is difficult in some ways</p>
<p t="6760920" d="3180">to discern given all of the detail.</p>
<p t="6764100" d="3762">So I would say, give our ancestors a break, for god sake.</p>
<p t="6767862" d="708">What do you want?</p>
<p t="6768570" d="7260">You want absolute perfect coherence when they&#39;re trying to be so inclusive?</p>
<p t="6775830" d="3210">It&#39;s very hard to be coherent when you&#39;re trying to be inclusive.</p>
<p t="6779040" d="1660">Those two things battle.</p>
<p t="6780700" d="3790">So have a little respect.</p>
<p t="6784490" d="1740">That&#39;s how it looks to me.</p>
<p t="6786230" d="1620">Those people weren&#39;t stupid.</p>
<p t="6787850" d="2580">They were seriously not stupid.</p>
<p t="6790430" d="4050">And what they thought was not stupid-- now, we can look at it in other ways.</p>
<p t="6794480" d="2110">Why is God in the sky?</p>
<p t="6796590" d="3920">Well, I know you can&#39;t see it in the city.</p>
<p t="6800510" d="2830">What&#39;s the fastest way to see infinity?</p>
<p t="6803340" d="1780">A look up at the night sky.</p>
<p t="6805120" d="1590">It&#39;s like, why is God up there?</p>
<p t="6806710" d="5160">Because when you look at the night sky, that&#39;s how you feel.</p>
<p t="6811870" d="1840">So is that wrong?</p>
<p t="6813710" d="1250">Well, it&#39;s not bad.</p>
<p t="6814960" d="2500">You know, it&#39;s like, well, where&#39;s the infinite?</p>
<p t="6817460" d="2090">Because that&#39;s really the question.</p>
<p t="6819550" d="1755">Well, it seems to be up there.</p>
<p t="6821305" d="1535">It&#39;s like, yeah.</p>
<p t="6822840" d="1240">Right.</p>
<p t="6824080" d="2016">OK, so you make your sacrifices.</p>
<p t="6826096" d="1374">It&#39;s like, why do people do that?</p>
<p t="6827470" d="1260">God, that&#39;s primitive.</p>
<p t="6828730" d="1820">It&#39;s like, no.</p>
<p t="6830550" d="2050">The invention of the sacrifice was probably</p>
<p t="6832600" d="6040">the single greatest stroke of genius that mankind ever</p>
<p t="6838640" d="3060">was given or produced.</p>
<p t="6841700" d="1590">What is a sacrifice?</p>
<p t="6843290" d="3180">You give up something of value now so that things</p>
<p t="6846470" d="1380">might be better in the future.</p>
<p t="6847850" d="1541">It&#39;s like that&#39;s the human discovery.</p>
<p t="6849391" d="1879">That&#39;s the human discovery of time.</p>
<p t="6851270" d="2010">Everybody makes sacrifices.</p>
<p t="6853280" d="3960">It&#39;s like, I&#39;m going to go to university instead of partying and snorting</p>
<p t="6857240" d="900">cocaine.</p>
<p t="6858140" d="2190">It&#39;s like, because that&#39;s fun.</p>
<p t="6860330" d="660">Why?</p>
<p t="6860990" d="2310">Well, because if I organize my behavior properly</p>
<p t="6863300" d="3120">and I make the right sacrifices, God will smile on me in the future,</p>
<p t="6866420" d="2520">or at least the probability seems enhanced.</p>
<p t="6868940" d="600">It&#39;s like, OK.</p>
<p t="6869540" d="2220">Well, we don&#39;t use the same terminology.</p>
<p t="6871760" d="1890">Well, we use the same terminology.</p>
<p t="6873650" d="2700">We don&#39;t burn rabbits.</p>
<p t="6876350" d="2520">But then again, we&#39;re not agriculturalists.</p>
<p t="6878870" d="3990">So the people who are playing with the idea of sacrifice,</p>
<p t="6882860" d="2640">they were acting out the discovery of time.</p>
<p t="6885500" d="1532">You can give up something now.</p>
<p t="6887032" d="3208">Try to get a bone from a dog and tell him you&#39;re going to give him two bones.</p>
<p t="6890240" d="2070">It&#39;s like, he doesn&#39;t give a damn about that.</p>
<p t="6892310" d="1930">Bone now.</p>
<p t="6894240" d="3410">And we regard the civilized person as the person who&#39;s</p>
<p t="6897650" d="2610">capable of deferring gratification.</p>
<p t="6900260" d="2340">Deferring gratification is a sacrifice.</p>
<p t="6902600" d="1410">Does it please God?</p>
<p t="6904010" d="3000">Well, everyone thinks so or they wouldn&#39;t do it.</p>
<p t="6907010" d="2220">So you burn the sacrifice.</p>
<p t="6909230" d="1390">Why?</p>
<p t="6910620" d="2100">Well, God&#39;s in heaven.</p>
<p t="6912720" d="2757">How else is he going to figure out the quality of your sacrifice?</p>
<p t="6915477" d="1833">Well, you might say, well, that&#39;s primitive.</p>
<p t="6917310" d="2220">It&#39;s like, don&#39;t be so sure.</p>
<p t="6919530" d="2250">It&#39;s like, they got the sacrifice idea right.</p>
<p t="6921780" d="2130">They got the awe part right.</p>
<p t="6923910" d="2190">If they&#39;re acting it out, it&#39;s concretized.</p>
<p t="6926100" d="1410">It&#39;s like a drama.</p>
<p t="6927510" d="2280">Does that make it primitive?</p>
<p t="6929790" d="2949">Well, no.</p>
<p t="6932739" d="791">It&#39;s not primitive.</p>
<p t="6933530" d="2040">It&#39;s unbelievably sophisticated.</p>
<p t="6935570" d="2277">It&#39;s ridiculously sophisticated.</p>
<p t="6937847" d="1833">Because the mode in the Old Testament is you</p>
<p t="6939680" d="3260">make the right sacrifices and you will thrive.</p>
<p t="6942940" d="1330">It&#39;s like, do we believe that?</p>
<p t="6944270" d="2100">Yeah, it&#39;s the basis of civilized behavior.</p>
<p t="6946370" d="4160">You don&#39;t get a complex civilization without that presupposition.</p>
<p t="6950530" d="3040">SPEAKER 1: So I think we&#39;ve actually done quite well.</p>
<p t="6953570" d="1030">JORDAN PETERSON: Good.</p>
<p t="6954600" d="2210">It&#39;s hard to keep to a linear track.</p>
<p t="6956810" d="3130">This is another problem with this kind of material.</p>
<p t="6959940" d="4380">It&#39;s like, you can call the process of coming to terms with this material</p>
<p t="6964320" d="6870">a circumambulation, a continual wandering around a center.</p>
<p t="6971190" d="5040">And you sort of specify the center almost by inference.</p>
<p t="6976230" d="3887">So it&#39;s one of the things that make Jung very difficult to read.</p>
<p t="6980117" d="2833">Because everything that he says is dependent on all the other things</p>
<p t="6982950" d="900">he said.</p>
<p t="6983850" d="2460">That&#39;s one of the problems I ran into when I was writing Maps of Meaning,</p>
<p t="6986310" d="500">too.</p>
<p t="6986810" d="3790">It&#39;s like, there&#39;s a presupposition at the bottom</p>
<p t="6990600" d="2880">that you have to accept in order to follow the logic.</p>
<p t="6993480" d="3630">And the presupposition is there are alternative ways</p>
<p t="6997110" d="2610">of laying out your initial presuppositions</p>
<p t="6999720" d="2170">about the nature of reality.</p>
<p t="7001890" d="1874">It&#39;s like, well, why should I accept that?</p>
<p t="7003764" d="2916">Well, I can&#39;t show you why till you accept it because I can&#39;t walk you</p>
<p t="7006680" d="875">through the argument.</p>
<p t="7007555" d="3335">It&#39;s a paradigm problem, fundamentally.</p>
<p t="7010890" d="2000">So the way I did that in Maps of Meaning was</p>
<p t="7012890" d="3180">that it was kind of like a small circle to begin with, and then a bigger</p>
<p t="7016070" d="2220">circle, and then a bigger circle.</p>
<p t="7018290" d="3492">So I could get all the elements described in a simple way,</p>
<p t="7021782" d="2958">and then make it a little more complex, and then a little more complex.</p>
<p t="7024740" d="4106">And that seemed to work to some degree, anyways.</p>
<p t="7028846" d="2374">SPEAKER 1: And there&#39;s something-- not to be sycophantic,</p>
<p t="7031220" d="2350">but there&#39;s something so compelling about it.</p>
<p t="7033570" d="5020">I think largely in part because that basic presupposition is not</p>
<p t="7038590" d="5954">articulated well, or even accepted in the sorts of science or social science</p>
<p t="7044544" d="1166">that we learn in university.</p>
<p t="7045710" d="2010">JORDAN PETERSON: That&#39;s partly why it&#39;s so shallow.</p>
<p t="7047720" d="1440">The social science, in particular.</p>
<p t="7049160" d="3810">It&#39;s like, man, it&#39;s unbelievable.</p>
<p t="7052970" d="1380">I should be careful about that.</p>
<p t="7054350" d="2460">I learned a lot from animal experimentalists.</p>
<p t="7056810" d="800">A lot.</p>
<p t="7057610" d="3640">And from neuroscientists, but most of the ones working on animals.</p>
<p t="7061250" d="1170">They learn things.</p>
<p t="7062420" d="2520">And part of that was a consequence of behaviorism, which</p>
<p t="7064940" d="4260">was a very reductionistic method--</p>
<p t="7069200" d="1230">useful.</p>
<p t="7070430" d="3150">So it&#39;s not like I dismissed the capacity of science</p>
<p t="7073580" d="5670">to produce useful information, but I am also terrified of it.</p>
<p t="7079250" d="4410">It&#39;s like, there&#39;s no reason to be so optimistic about scientific truth.</p>
<p t="7083660" d="5160">The other thing that I&#39;ve noticed about the rationalists--</p>
<p t="7088820" d="4500">the empiricists, they&#39;re sort of off in the same corner--</p>
<p t="7093320" d="2250">is that they always make the assumption that if we</p>
<p t="7095570" d="6760">transcend our historical religions, we&#39;ll no longer be religious.</p>
<p t="7102330" d="1950">And what we will be is rational.</p>
<p t="7104280" d="1050">It&#39;s like, I think, no.</p>
<p t="7105330" d="3240">No, you&#39;re completely out of your cotton-picking mind if you think that.</p>
<p t="7108570" d="4890">It&#39;s like, well, how do you account for the emergence of new age philosophy?</p>
<p t="7113460" d="3870">It&#39;s like, if you want incoherent, just take a wander through that desert.</p>
<p t="7117330" d="3590">It&#39;s like, you blow out these historically--</p>
<p t="7120920" d="4360">these carefully constructed historical frameworks, what you get</p>
<p t="7125280" d="4110">is like rampant and insane Protestantism.</p>
<p t="7129390" d="5730">The idea that people will magically become like Newton because we&#39;ve</p>
<p t="7135120" d="4680">blown out the substructure of morality.</p>
<p t="7139800" d="5520">That&#39;s so absurd that that&#39;s the sort of thought that I think is motivated.</p>
<p t="7145320" d="2640">It&#39;s like, there&#39;s a reason to believe that because who</p>
<p t="7147960" d="1950">the hell would believe that?</p>
<p t="7149910" d="4870">You don&#39;t know anything about people if you believe that.</p>
<p t="7154780" d="2730">It&#39;s hard to think scientifically.</p>
<p t="7157510" d="1620">It&#39;s really hard.</p>
<p t="7159130" d="3030">Here&#39;s a way of thinking, too.</p>
<p t="7162160" d="4530">You can reduce religion to sort of Darwinian principles</p>
<p t="7166690" d="2010">and sort of destroy it that way.</p>
<p t="7168700" d="3120">You Or, you can expand your notion of Darwinism,</p>
<p t="7171820" d="4800">so that it actually encompasses the genuine phenomena of religion.</p>
<p t="7176620" d="2250">Man, that is way more interesting.</p>
<p t="7178870" d="3030">But the problem is, it&#39;s also the problem--</p>
<p t="7181900" d="2640">the reason that people won&#39;t read Jung.</p>
<p t="7184540" d="3810">First, he&#39;s very difficult. Second, he is terrifying.</p>
<p t="7188350" d="3150">It&#39;s terrifying to read Jung.</p>
<p t="7191500" d="3840">Well, because no one thinks like he thought.</p>
<p t="7195340" d="1380">Nobody thinks like that.</p>
<p t="7196720" d="3690">I mean, his grasp of the development of ideas stretched over,</p>
<p t="7200410" d="2080">like I said, 10,000 years.</p>
<p t="7202490" d="3640">It puts the Enlightenment thinkers to shame.</p>
<p t="7206130" d="3820">But if you start grappling seriously with the idea</p>
<p t="7209950" d="3120">that ideas have people instead of people having ideas,</p>
<p t="7213070" d="3550">that forces you to re-evaluate the entire nature of your being.</p>
<p t="7216620" d="3890">Because the other thing he asked is, which ideas have you,</p>
<p t="7220510" d="5030">and where are they suggesting that you go?</p>
<p t="7225540" d="2260">And that&#39;s like the Greek god idea, right?</p>
<p t="7227800" d="2020">We&#39;re playthings of the gods.</p>
<p t="7229820" d="3950">It&#39;s like, well, Dawkins already knows about memes.</p>
<p t="7233770" d="2330">These are like meta-memes.</p>
<p t="7236100" d="4600">And so let&#39;s not be too incautious about who&#39;s in control here.</p>
<p t="7240700" d="1320">So it&#39;s like, OK.</p>
<p t="7242020" d="2430">Well you&#39;ve developed a nihilistic philosophy</p>
<p t="7244450" d="1650">that&#39;s predicated on rationalism.</p>
<p t="7246100" d="780">Fine.</p>
<p t="7246880" d="1410">Why?</p>
<p t="7248290" d="1380">Who&#39;s behind that?</p>
<p t="7249670" d="980">Precisely.</p>
<p t="7250650" d="500">You?</p>
<p t="7251150" d="1940">It&#39;s like, yeah, right.</p>
<p t="7253090" d="1590">No way.</p>
<p t="7254680" d="4020">A thousand other people wouldn&#39;t think exactly the same way if it was you.</p>
<p t="7258700" d="1510">You&#39;re just in its grip.</p>
<p t="7260210" d="3510">And what&#39;s it up to?</p>
<p t="7263720" d="2650">It&#39;s up for the betterment of humanity.</p>
<p t="7266370" d="880">Sure.</p>
<p t="7267250" d="1130">Maybe.</p>
<p t="7268380" d="2900">But you know, I wouldn&#39;t bet my life on it.</p>
<p t="7271280" d="4350">When Jung wrote about alchemy, which his writings on alchemy</p>
<p t="7275630" d="1260">are incredibly opaque.</p>
<p t="7276890" d="3540">But I can give you a bit of an insight into them.</p>
<p t="7280430" d="2430">You can understand Jung&#39;s readings on alchemy</p>
<p t="7282860" d="3540">if you start from the presupposition that the matter that alchemists</p>
<p t="7286400" d="1560">were studying wasn&#39;t matter.</p>
<p t="7287960" d="2430">It was information.</p>
<p t="7290390" d="3060">Now, the relationship between matter and information is very complex.</p>
<p t="7293450" d="2940">And some people think the substrate of things</p>
<p t="7296390" d="3700">is information and matter is sort of an emergent property.</p>
<p t="7300090" d="1810">Whatever, it&#39;s complicated.</p>
<p t="7301900" d="7540">Now, if you&#39;re studying information, you can&#39;t study it objectively, precisely.</p>
<p t="7309440" d="3840">Because as you study the information, you get informed.</p>
<p t="7313280" d="1650">That changes you.</p>
<p t="7314930" d="2970">And so the problem with studying this sort of thing</p>
<p t="7317900" d="3000">is that you can&#39;t study it without being changed.</p>
<p t="7320900" d="4710">Because if you&#39;re not changed by studying it, you&#39;re not studying it.</p>
<p t="7325610" d="2400">You&#39;re no anthropologist who&#39;s outside of this.</p>
<p t="7328010" d="930">You can&#39;t be.</p>
<p t="7328940" d="2560">Because if you&#39;re outside of it, you don&#39;t understand it.</p>
<p t="7331500" d="4050">Because if you understand it, then you&#39;re not the same person anymore.</p>
<p t="7335550" d="2960">So you can&#39;t keep it at bay.</p>
<p t="7338510" d="2970">And so that&#39;s also partly why Jung is terrifying.</p>
<p t="7341480" d="2490">You</p>
<p t="7343970" d="1950">I read-- and I don&#39;t remember where--</p>
<p t="7345920" d="4680">the crucifix has Latin letters on the top of it.</p>
<p t="7350600" d="5460">And it&#39;s I-N-R-I. It&#39;s the representation of Jesus Christ,</p>
<p t="7356060" d="1380">King of the Jews.</p>
<p t="7357440" d="3660">Hypothetically, that was put on his cross.</p>
<p t="7361100" d="3280">There&#39;s an occult interpretation of that, which is also Latin,</p>
<p t="7364380" d="1160">which I can&#39;t remember.</p>
<p t="7365540" d="3270">But it means all nature is renewed by fire.</p>
<p t="7368810" d="4320">And so the crucifixion then is assimilated</p>
<p t="7373130" d="1470">to the idea of a forest fire.</p>
<p t="7374600" d="2430">Everything burns down before there&#39;s new growth.</p>
<p t="7377030" d="4600">If you study religion properly, it will demolish your personality.</p>
<p t="7381630" d="2880">Your personality, like the personality that&#39;s you,</p>
<p t="7384510" d="3141">is like the dead branches on a pine tree.</p>
<p t="7387651" d="2249">You might be clinging to them because you think, well,</p>
<p t="7389900" d="1200">I&#39;m all these dead branches.</p>
<p t="7391100" d="2490">It&#39;s like, well, yeah.</p>
<p t="7393590" d="2480">But first of all, you should let go of them.</p>
<p t="7396070" d="1900">And second, you should let them burn off.</p>
<p t="7397970" d="1833">And then you might think, well, I don&#39;t want</p>
<p t="7399803" d="1617">them to burn off because that&#39;s me.</p>
<p t="7401420" d="1250">It&#39;s like, yeah, that&#39;s true.</p>
<p t="7402670" d="3460">But it&#39;s the false you that you&#39;re clinging to.</p>
<p t="7406130" d="3540">Well, that doesn&#39;t mean you want to be burned up in the flames.</p>
<p t="7409670" d="5250">So to study this material properly is to be burned up in the flames.</p>
<p t="7414920" d="1920">And there&#39;s no escaping that.</p>
<p t="7416840" d="3390">You&#39;re just not in it if that doesn&#39;t happen.</p>
<p t="7420230" d="2280">You don&#39;t get it.</p>
<p t="7422510" d="3060">One of the things I realized when I started studying this</p>
<p t="7425570" d="4830">was that virtually everything I said was a lie.</p>
<p t="7430400" d="3000">I would say 99%.</p>
<p t="7433400" d="3120">And by lie, I mean, it was manipulative.</p>
<p t="7436520" d="1110">It was unclear.</p>
<p t="7437630" d="690">It was vague.</p>
<p t="7438320" d="1980">And that was all often motivated.</p>
<p t="7440300" d="4492">Or, it was a false attempt to gain dominance status, which is</p>
<p t="7444792" d="1583">typical of someone who&#39;s intellectual.</p>
<p t="7446375" d="2475">It&#39;s like, well, I&#39;ve got these ideas.</p>
<p t="7448850" d="1750">I&#39;ve taken them from places.</p>
<p t="7450600" d="3260">And now I can use them as, say, a status weapon, something</p>
<p t="7453860" d="3750">like that, which is what people do when they&#39;re trying to win an argument, say.</p>
<p t="7457610" d="1770">It&#39;s like, that&#39;s all lies.</p>
<p t="7459380" d="3150">Well, that&#39;s rough when it&#39;s 99% of what you say.</p>
<p t="7462530" d="3420">First of all, the first thing you realize is how much you aren&#39;t.</p>
<p t="7465950" d="3260">You&#39;re not Nietzsche.</p>
<p t="7469210" d="6280">You have your experiences, your claim to reality, and it&#39;s often pretty thin.</p>
<p t="7475490" d="3450">But the development of authentic speech is worth</p>
<p t="7478940" d="4100">the price that you have to pay for it.</p>
<p t="7483040" d="2295">But you just can&#39;t stay detached from this.</p>
<p t="7485335" d="3915">This isn&#39;t the phenomenon to study.</p>
<p t="7489250" d="2580">It&#39;s the basis of being.</p>
<p t="7491830" d="6750">SPEAKER 1: So on that note, because that&#39;s an expression of your experience</p>
<p t="7498580" d="3110">really delving in-depth into material.</p>
<p t="7501690" d="3855">Whereas, there are other researchers looking at this from a different angle.</p>
<p t="7505545" d="1625">I&#39;m not saying it&#39;s more or less valid.</p>
<p t="7507170" d="1380">It&#39;s just different.</p>
<p t="7508550" d="2220">And they&#39;re looking at this from why--</p>
<p t="7510770" d="2880">not necessarily why or how does religion come about,</p>
<p t="7513650" d="2880">where do these ideas come from, and why are they important,</p>
<p t="7516530" d="4260">so much as once they&#39;re there, why do they perpetuate?</p>
<p t="7520790" d="2190">And why are they successful?</p>
<p t="7522980" d="6390">Why do religions exist when there seems to be so much that a rationalist would</p>
<p t="7529370" d="1694">find objectionable or just silly?</p>
<p t="7531064" d="916">JORDAN PETERSON: Sure.</p>
<p t="7531980" d="500">Yeah.</p>
<p t="7532480" d="3220">That begs the question, who&#39;s silly?</p>
<p t="7535700" d="2430">The rationalist assumes that it&#39;s not him.</p>
<p t="7538130" d="1530">It&#39;s like, OK.</p>
<p t="7539660" d="1620">Let&#39;s have some evidence.</p>
<p t="7541280" d="2070">Well, we can fly to the moon.</p>
<p t="7543350" d="840">Fair enough.</p>
<p t="7544190" d="1410">That&#39;s one form of evidence.</p>
<p t="7545600" d="2240">How long has this been working?</p>
<p t="7547840" d="2130">200 years.</p>
<p t="7549970" d="1840">OK.</p>
<p t="7551810" d="3720">Let&#39;s iterate it for a million years and see what happens.</p>
<p t="7555530" d="630">Right.</p>
<p t="7556160" d="1740">And you can object to that because you can say, well,</p>
<p t="7557900" d="1999">who knows where the future will lead, and so on.</p>
<p t="7559899" d="1691">But my point is that--</p>
<p t="7561590" d="8060">well, again, what you assume to be true structures your argument.</p>
<p t="7569650" d="3090">And you have to assume something to be true because you</p>
<p t="7572740" d="1620">don&#39;t have infinite knowledge.</p>
<p t="7574360" d="2280">So you make that initial choice.</p>
<p t="7576640" d="2470">Why?</p>
<p t="7579110" d="3060">Well, it might be because you&#39;re a true truth seeker.</p>
<p t="7582170" d="3390">Well, I would be careful about making that claim Right</p>
<p t="7585560" d="3300">because you&#39;re probably not.</p>
<p t="7588860" d="1230">So then, who are you?</p>
<p t="7590090" d="2730">SPEAKER 1: We&#39;re motivated by something that we&#39;re not aware of?</p>
<p t="7592820" d="3450">JORDAN PETERSON: There&#39;s no probably about that.</p>
<p t="7596270" d="500">Yeah.</p>
<p t="7596770" d="2610">Not only that, you might be motivated by terrible things</p>
<p t="7599380" d="3490">that you&#39;re not aware of, like truly terrible things.</p>
<p t="7602870" d="500">You</p>
<p t="7603370" d="2910">One of the things Jung said about the shadow, which</p>
<p t="7606280" d="3000">was-- for him, that was sort of all those parts of you</p>
<p t="7609280" d="2430">that weren&#39;t very developed and are mad about it</p>
<p t="7611710" d="3060">because you&#39;re like trying to kill them.</p>
<p t="7614770" d="3810">And all those sort of storehouse of lies and deception that you&#39;ve managed</p>
<p t="7618580" d="4230">and all the things you&#39;ve left undone and the motivations for doing all that.</p>
<p t="7622810" d="1410">It&#39;s like, that&#39;s the shadow.</p>
<p t="7624220" d="4410">He said, well, the shadow is rooted in hell.</p>
<p t="7628630" d="1950">And you think, well, that&#39;s a nice metaphor.</p>
<p t="7630580" d="3610">It&#39;s like, don&#39;t be so sure it&#39;s a metaphor.</p>
<p t="7634190" d="3990">It&#39;s not exactly a metaphor.</p>
<p t="7638180" d="5470">I can elaborate on that a little bit.</p>
<p t="7643650" d="5510">If you walk down [INAUDIBLE] Street, and you watch, you can see people in hell</p>
<p t="7649160" d="1890">with no problem.</p>
<p t="7651050" d="2610">They&#39;re not only the people who are completely lost--</p>
<p t="7653660" d="4390">the homeless-- but they&#39;re the homeless that you cannot look at.</p>
<p t="7658050" d="2480">And the reason you can&#39;t look at them is because they</p>
<p t="7660530" d="4500">find your act of mirroring their state of existence intolerable.</p>
<p t="7665030" d="2110">It will instantly enrage them.</p>
<p t="7667140" d="2210">And that&#39;s because they&#39;re in chaos.</p>
<p t="7669350" d="1110">They&#39;re in the underworld.</p>
<p t="7670460" d="3150">But they&#39;re in a particular suburb of the underworld.</p>
<p t="7673610" d="2580">And that little suburb, that&#39;s hell.</p>
<p t="7676190" d="4060">And you think, well, is it eternal?</p>
<p t="7680250" d="1190">It depends what you mean.</p>
<p t="7681440" d="1780">It&#39;s been around a long time.</p>
<p t="7683220" d="1400">It&#39;s been around a long time.</p>
<p t="7684620" d="1410">And it&#39;s really deep.</p>
<p t="7686030" d="3600">And there&#39;s another weird thing about hell, which is if you&#39;re in it,</p>
<p t="7689630" d="2760">no matter how bad it is, there&#39;s some stupid thing you</p>
<p t="7692390" d="1920">can do to make it worse.</p>
<p t="7694310" d="2340">And that&#39;s why it&#39;s bottomless.</p>
<p t="7696650" d="4218">It&#39;s not obvious what&#39;s a metaphor.</p>
<p t="7700868" d="1491">Does heaven exist?</p>
<p t="7705840" d="1220">Depends on what you mean.</p>
<p t="7707060" d="2970">I think people get glimpses of it all the time.</p>
<p t="7710030" d="3750">Those are the times in your life when the meaning shines through.</p>
<p t="7713780" d="3560">It&#39;s like, that&#39;s a place when the meaning shines through.</p>
<p t="7717340" d="970">That&#39;s a place.</p>
<p t="7718310" d="2910">If you conceptualize things as four-dimensional,</p>
<p t="7721220" d="2370">this place shifts with time.</p>
<p t="7723590" d="4830">So we&#39;re actually sitting in a multitude of places here.</p>
<p t="7728420" d="3000">Now and then, that place configures itself,</p>
<p t="7731420" d="2700">so that it&#39;s as perfect as it can be.</p>
<p t="7734120" d="1770">You get a glimpse.</p>
<p t="7735890" d="3120">And then you think, well, what if it could always be like that?</p>
<p t="7739010" d="3320">It&#39;s like, well, what if it could be always like that?</p>
<p t="7742330" d="2200">So you might say, for example, what would</p>
<p t="7744530" d="2460">happen if everybody told the truth?</p>
<p t="7746990" d="2170">We know what happens when people don&#39;t.</p>
<p t="7749160" d="3980">You get the Gulag Archipelago.</p>
<p t="7753140" d="3750">What&#39;s the opposite of that?</p>
<p t="7756890" d="1280">Well, we don&#39;t know.</p>
<p t="7758170" d="2900">We do know that there is an opposite, though.</p>
<p t="7761070" d="7130">So people are incautious about their discussions of what constitutes real.</p>
<p t="7768200" d="1920">They don&#39;t even notice their own experience.</p>
<p t="7770120" d="1560">You&#39;ve never been to the underworld?</p>
<p t="7771680" d="3280">It&#39;s like, you&#39;ve been there every time things have fallen apart in your life.</p>
<p t="7774960" d="2330">I tell people that all the time in my lectures.</p>
<p t="7777290" d="3216">Here&#39;s what the underworld means.</p>
<p t="7780506" d="1374">You&#39;ve been married for 10 years.</p>
<p t="7781880" d="1680">You&#39;re happily married.</p>
<p t="7783560" d="750">You come home.</p>
<p t="7784310" d="720">Your wife&#39;s gone.</p>
<p t="7785030" d="5010">There&#39;s a note that says, I&#39;m leaving with my lover of the last 10 years.</p>
<p t="7790040" d="4200">It&#39;s like, well, you were somewhere before you walked into the house</p>
<p t="7794240" d="1680">and now you&#39;re somewhere different.</p>
<p t="7795920" d="2340">Where are you now?</p>
<p t="7798260" d="2360">Well, you&#39;re where you go when the bottom drops out.</p>
<p t="7800620" d="1520">Where is that?</p>
<p t="7802140" d="1351">Well, it&#39;s in the underworld.</p>
<p t="7803491" d="1499">It&#39;s like, you&#39;re in the underworld.</p>
<p t="7804990" d="5070">You&#39;re in that chaotic state that exists before order is constructed.</p>
<p t="7810060" d="1360">You go there all the time.</p>
<p t="7811420" d="1940">SPEAKER 1: And the reason people can&#39;t see</p>
<p t="7813360" d="4560">the connection between their experience and these earlier</p>
<p t="7817920" d="3210">mythological representations is because people</p>
<p t="7821130" d="2300">are being anachronistic and reinterpreting</p>
<p t="7823430" d="1756">mythological representations as if--</p>
<p t="7825186" d="1874">JORDAN PETERSON: They&#39;re scientific theories.</p>
<p t="7827060" d="2160">SPEAKER 1: As if these people were naive scientists.</p>
<p t="7829220" d="300">JORDAN PETERSON: Yeah.</p>
<p t="7829520" d="2666">SPEAKER 1: Really, what they were doing is coming up with images</p>
<p t="7832186" d="3124">to explain things that they couldn&#39;t otherwise represent, but were real</p>
<p t="7835310" d="1458">in terms of their lived experience.</p>
<p t="7836768" d="852">Is that accurate?</p>
<p t="7837620" d="1680">JORDAN PETERSON: Absolutely.</p>
<p t="7839300" d="570">Yeah.</p>
<p t="7839870" d="3330">Why would we think they were naive scientists?</p>
<p t="7843200" d="2670">Is a chimp a naive scientist?</p>
<p t="7845870" d="1987">It&#39;s just silly.</p>
<p t="7847857" d="2333">They weren&#39;t naive scientists, whatever they were doing.</p>
<p t="7850190" d="2580">Well, I think they were naive phenomenologists,</p>
<p t="7852770" d="1590">but they weren&#39;t very naive.</p>
<p t="7854360" d="4510">They weren&#39;t concerned with material reality.</p>
<p t="7858870" d="3146">They were concerned with the nature of being.</p>
<p t="7862016" d="1374">I mean, that&#39;s Heidegger&#39;s claim.</p>
<p t="7863390" d="3810">He believed that-- and again, I didn&#39;t know this until much later.</p>
<p t="7867200" d="4650">Heidegger believed that philosophy actually lost its way with the Greeks.</p>
<p t="7871850" d="3330">With Plato, for example, when things became rationalized.</p>
<p t="7875180" d="2070">Nietzsche thought the same thing in many ways</p>
<p t="7877250" d="4980">because he was very interested in the Dionysian, which is more like--</p>
<p t="7882230" d="3480">well, that&#39;s more like lived experience, the Dionysian.</p>
<p t="7885710" d="3590">That&#39;s the chemist who goes out and--</p>
<p t="7889300" d="4200">maybe he&#39;s a punk rocker in his spare time and he goes out in the evening</p>
<p t="7893500" d="4910">and listens to a thrash metal band and pounds himself against other people</p>
<p t="7898410" d="2170">and doesn&#39;t see any contradiction there.</p>
<p t="7900580" d="2770">It&#39;s like, well, one&#39;s rational.</p>
<p t="7903350" d="740">Another isn&#39;t.</p>
<p t="7904090" d="1770">That&#39;s a contradiction.</p>
<p t="7905860" d="2250">Well, you find the irrational activity enjoyable.</p>
<p t="7908110" d="2040">Well, how do you account for that?</p>
<p t="7910150" d="570">You don&#39;t.</p>
<p t="7910720" d="2430">You just keep the worlds separate.</p>
<p t="7913150" d="4530">So our ancestors were phenomenologists.</p>
<p t="7917680" d="3240">And they were accounting for their landscapes.</p>
<p t="7920920" d="2644">They&#39;re the geography of being.</p>
<p t="7923564" d="1166">Well, there&#39;s an underworld.</p>
<p t="7924730" d="1290">Well when do you go there?</p>
<p t="7926020" d="1840">Well, when things fall apart.</p>
<p t="7927860" d="1730">It&#39;s like, that&#39;s where you end up.</p>
<p t="7929590" d="1320">Everyone gets that.</p>
<p t="7930910" d="3430">You know, I tell these stories to retirees and all sorts of people.</p>
<p t="7934340" d="1570">I say, look.</p>
<p t="7935910" d="3200">There is a place that you go when everything falls apart.</p>
<p t="7939110" d="1850">It&#39;s like, oh, I&#39;ve been there.</p>
<p t="7940960" d="2899">Then the question is, well, what do you do when you get there?</p>
<p t="7943859" d="1541">Because everybody needs to know that.</p>
<p t="7945400" d="3060">That&#39;s another thing that religious stories are trying to tell you.</p>
<p t="7948460" d="2640">When things fall apart, what do you do?</p>
<p t="7951100" d="3690">Well, we don&#39;t think of when things fall apart as a place,</p>
<p t="7954790" d="1530">but that&#39;s our problem.</p>
<p t="7956320" d="957">It&#39;s a place.</p>
<p t="7957277" d="1083">I mean, people live in it.</p>
<p t="7958360" d="1977">All you have to do is go look on the street.</p>
<p t="7960337" d="833">It&#39;s like, oh, look.</p>
<p t="7961170" d="1870">That person is in the underworld.</p>
<p t="7963040" d="2130">It&#39;s like, and that person&#39;s in hell.</p>
<p t="7965170" d="1960">And you can tell, but you won&#39;t look.</p>
<p t="7967130" d="4250">What usually happens in a circumstance like that is they&#39;re so much in hell,</p>
<p t="7971380" d="2920">that you&#39;ll just walk around them, and you won&#39;t look at them.</p>
<p t="7974300" d="2410">Well, why not?</p>
<p t="7976710" d="1590">You don&#39;t want to go there.</p>
<p t="7978300" d="1609">Yeah, that&#39;s right.</p>
<p t="7979909" d="2291">SPEAKER 1: We actually have that expression in English,</p>
<p t="7982200" d="660">I don&#39;t want to go there.</p>
<p t="7982860" d="1020">JORDAN PETERSON: Right.</p>
<p t="7983880" d="2580">SPEAKER 1: So encoded in the way we think,</p>
<p t="7986460" d="2294">there is this inherent locality or geography.</p>
<p t="7988754" d="916">JORDAN PETERSON: Yeah.</p>
<p t="7989670" d="1610">Well, and it is a geography.</p>
<p t="7991280" d="5020">It&#39;s a slice of space time.</p>
<p t="7996300" d="2820">It&#39;s also the street, but it&#39;s not just the street.</p>
<p t="7999120" d="5570">It&#39;s the being of the street.</p>
<p t="8004690" d="2734">SPEAKER 1: It&#39;s everything that is afforded by the representation</p>
<p t="8007424" d="916">of street in our mind.</p>
<p t="8008340" d="2359">It has other meanings beyond what we--</p>
<p t="8010699" d="2291">which is something we didn&#39;t touch on at all, actually.</p>
<p t="8012990" d="6700">I wish we had, which is the complexity management theory angle in the sense</p>
<p t="8019690" d="4147">that how we compartmentalize reality is not at all a given.</p>
<p t="8023837" d="833">JORDAN PETERSON: No.</p>
<p t="8024670" d="1242">You do it on the fly.</p>
<p t="8025912" d="708">SPEAKER 1: Right.</p>
<p t="8026620" d="2190">JORDAN PETERSON: And you do it for pragmatic reasons.</p>
<p t="8028810" d="1890">And so in some sense, what you do is you look</p>
<p t="8030700" d="3660">for the simplest possible and least energetic</p>
<p t="8034360" d="2610">way of conceptualizing the current situation</p>
<p t="8036970" d="3770">so that the next thing you want to do happens.</p>
<p t="8040740" d="1130">It&#39;s something like that.</p>
<p t="8041870" d="3120">And I like to think about it in terms of resolution,</p>
<p t="8044990" d="3090">because I think resolution is a really useful idea.</p>
<p t="8048080" d="3930">Most of our representations of reality are extremely low resolution.</p>
<p t="8052010" d="1380">Like, we&#39;ll rely on a thumbnail.</p>
<p t="8053390" d="1310">Well, why not?</p>
<p t="8054700" d="950">It&#39;s good enough.</p>
<p t="8055650" d="1160">It&#39;s pragmatic.</p>
<p t="8056810" d="1290">It&#39;s good enough.</p>
<p t="8058100" d="2610">Don&#39;t make it anymore complex than it has to be.</p>
<p t="8060710" d="2460">And what you are managing always is complexity.</p>
<p t="8063170" d="6090">Because the thing-- the representation you use, which is an image, let&#39;s say,</p>
<p t="8069260" d="4180">is a low-resolution representation of the reality behind the image.</p>
<p t="8073440" d="1771">So for example, you&#39;re sitting there.</p>
<p t="8075211" d="499">OK.</p>
<p t="8075710" d="2020">Well, I can&#39;t see your back.</p>
<p t="8077730" d="1529">So I can&#39;t see your family.</p>
<p t="8079259" d="1041">I can&#39;t see your culture.</p>
<p t="8080300" d="1500">I can&#39;t see your education.</p>
<p t="8081800" d="2910">I can&#39;t see the biosphere that you&#39;re an embedded part of.</p>
<p t="8084710" d="2190">I can&#39;t see any of your substructures.</p>
<p t="8086900" d="1590">It&#39;s like, they&#39;re all there.</p>
<p t="8088490" d="3130">They&#39;re just as real as the thing that I see.</p>
<p t="8091620" d="3372">They&#39;re causally implicated in everything that you do.</p>
<p t="8094992" d="1208">It&#39;s like, that&#39;s complexity.</p>
<p t="8100050" d="8270">I&#39;m assuming that you&#39;re what we both decided to allow to be possible here.</p>
<p t="8108320" d="1530">Right Because we&#39;re both polite.</p>
<p t="8109850" d="2670">We&#39;re doing this little act that we both agree.</p>
<p t="8112520" d="2946">And we&#39;ve never met, but we&#39;re going to run this routine.</p>
<p t="8115466" d="1374">We&#39;re going to play by the rules.</p>
<p t="8116840" d="4800">But for all I know, you could just turn left right now.</p>
<p t="8121640" d="4440">And then all of a sudden, all that complexity is like-- it&#39;s there.</p>
<p t="8126080" d="672">That&#39;s chaos.</p>
<p t="8126752" d="1458">It&#39;s like, that&#39;s a potential, too.</p>
<p t="8128210" d="4770">Because maybe I think, well, what we&#39;re doing is too mundane.</p>
<p t="8132980" d="1860">It&#39;s boring.</p>
<p t="8134840" d="1360">I&#39;m caught in it.</p>
<p t="8136200" d="2160">It&#39;s like, I hope you turn left a little bit,</p>
<p t="8138360" d="2090">because then that&#39;s the water of life, too.</p>
<p t="8140450" d="4970">That refreshing complexity comes back, but hopefully not too much of it.</p>
<p t="8145420" d="2200">Right I don&#39;t want too much of it.</p>
<p t="8147620" d="2010">I want a little bite-sized piece of it that will</p>
<p t="8149630" d="3000">make me interested and not terrified.</p>
<p t="8152630" d="1740">So that&#39;s complexity.</p>
<p t="8154370" d="2700">And that&#39;s a better way of conceptualizing</p>
<p t="8157070" d="1890">what the terror management guys are after</p>
<p t="8158960" d="2700">with regards to the fear of death.</p>
<p t="8161660" d="3660">So partly, I don&#39;t think they&#39;re very imaginative.</p>
<p t="8165320" d="4260">There&#39;s many worse things than death to be terrified of.</p>
<p t="8169580" d="3490">Like, insanity is probably one.</p>
<p t="8173070" d="2090">Pain, that&#39;s a bad one.</p>
<p t="8175160" d="3120">Long-term pain, that&#39;s a bad one.</p>
<p t="8178280" d="2910">Well, then there&#39;s long-term pointless pain.</p>
<p t="8181190" d="3820">Then, there&#39;s your long-term pointless pain and that of your family.</p>
<p t="8185010" d="5010">There&#39;s horrors that exceed death by orders of magnitude.</p>
<p t="8190020" d="6580">So to make that the fundamental fear, I think that&#39;s an error.</p>
<p t="8196600" d="6010">It&#39;s like, are people more afraid of dying or having their children die?</p>
<p t="8202610" d="3779">That&#39;s a perfectly reasonable question.</p>
<p t="8206389" d="4381">So I read Becker.</p>
<p t="8210770" d="1199">Really, read him.</p>
<p t="8211969" d="1201">I like Becker&#39;s book.</p>
<p t="8213170" d="2306">It&#39;s brilliant, but he makes a bunch of mistakes.</p>
<p t="8215476" d="2583">One of the things he does, for example, is right in the intro.</p>
<p t="8218059" d="5221">He says, it&#39;s a book that&#39;s trying to bring about the psychoanalytic closure</p>
<p t="8223280" d="1246">of the study of religion.</p>
<p t="8224526" d="874">So it&#39;s Neo-Freudian.</p>
<p t="8225400" d="2620">It&#39;s smartly Neo-Freudian.</p>
<p t="8228020" d="3061">And he wants to explain religion, pretty much completely</p>
<p t="8231081" d="1499">within the psychoanalytic framework.</p>
<p t="8232580" d="1502">He does a great job.</p>
<p t="8234082" d="1708">But in the intro he says, well, you might</p>
<p t="8235790" d="3810">wonder why in a book that&#39;s devoted to the last word</p>
<p t="8239600" d="4920">in psychoanalytic thinking about religion, I never mention Jung.</p>
<p t="8244520" d="2010">So then he says a bunch of things about Jung.</p>
<p t="8246530" d="3179">One of them is I could never understand a single thing</p>
<p t="8249709" d="2670">he was talking about when he wrote all his works on alchemy.</p>
<p t="8252379" d="930">It&#39;s like, oh, well.</p>
<p t="8253309" d="3871">That&#39;s a problem because that&#39;s where all the information</p>
<p t="8257180" d="1920">that your book lacks is.</p>
<p t="8259100" d="570">All of it.</p>
<p t="8259670" d="750">You missed it.</p>
<p t="8260420" d="1620">It&#39;s like, yeah.</p>
<p t="8262040" d="4200">You&#39;re thinking about the hero myth, for example, as a delusion.</p>
<p t="8266240" d="3569">And as a hero project and as something that&#39;s only there</p>
<p t="8269809" d="1900">to stave off the fear of death.</p>
<p t="8271709" d="7331">It&#39;s like, well, you got a good way into the depths, but--</p>
<p t="8279040" d="7919">and way farther than most people get, but you missed the next 300 stories.</p>
<p t="8286959" d="1680">And that&#39;s too bad.</p>
<p t="8288639" d="610">So</p>
<p t="8289249" d="2541">And it&#39;s funny because I&#39;ve also read the social psychology--</p>
<p t="8291790" d="900">a fair bit of it--</p>
<p t="8292690" d="1750">that is associated with terror management.</p>
<p t="8294440" d="3920">And most of the problem with it is it hasn&#39;t moved Becker one inch.</p>
<p t="8298360" d="2699">It&#39;s like, yeah, that&#39;s what Becker said.</p>
<p t="8301059" d="1021">So we&#39;re proving it.</p>
<p t="8302080" d="1889">Well, no.</p>
<p t="8303969" d="1021">Not really.</p>
<p t="8304990" d="6100">Because the demonstrations are amenable to multiple interpretations.</p>
<p t="8311090" d="1910">But Becker, he covered it.</p>
<p t="8313000" d="1830">I mean, it&#39;s a brilliant book.</p>
<p t="8314830" d="1860">But it&#39;s wrong.</p>
<p t="8316690" d="1109">SPEAKER 1: Right.</p>
<p t="8317799" d="3491">So on that note, this argument is wrong in what way?</p>
<p t="8321290" d="1997">For people that may not have read Becker,</p>
<p t="8323287" d="2333">they&#39;re not fully aware of the terror management theory.</p>
<p t="8325620" d="2333">JORDAN PETERSON: Because he thinks of everything that we</p>
<p t="8327953" d="2897">do to contend with mortality as a ruse.</p>
<p t="8330850" d="2880">And I don&#39;t think that&#39;s right.</p>
<p t="8333730" d="4409">Because I don&#39;t think that it&#39;s necessary to be terrified of death.</p>
<p t="8338139" d="2881">Now, it&#39;s not easy not to be.</p>
<p t="8341020" d="4884">But you know, it&#39;s fate that as far as Becker&#39;s concerned</p>
<p t="8345904" d="2166">is that that&#39;s what you&#39;re going to be terrified of.</p>
<p t="8348070" d="4510">It&#39;s like, well, I don&#39;t think that that&#39;s right.</p>
<p t="8352580" d="3280">I think that people don&#39;t have to be terrified of death.</p>
<p t="8355860" d="1970">It&#39;s not an easy state to achieve.</p>
<p t="8357830" d="2070">It&#39;s not like I want to die.</p>
<p t="8359900" d="4680">Although, I can certainly imagine things that are worse than that, no problem.</p>
<p t="8364580" d="2549">I think-- and this is something Solzhenitsyn laid out</p>
<p t="8367129" d="1291">in the Gulag Archipelago, too.</p>
<p t="8368420" d="2910">I think there are ways of living that are worse than death.</p>
<p t="8371330" d="1960">That&#39;s Why people commit suicide.</p>
<p t="8373290" d="1589">That&#39;s their decision.</p>
<p t="8374879" d="6651">So obviously, hell is worse than death given how I described it earlier.</p>
<p t="8381530" d="1859">So it isn&#39;t death that&#39;s the problem.</p>
<p t="8383389" d="3301">It&#39;s complexity that&#39;s the problem, is that things are beyond us.</p>
<p t="8386690" d="4620">And because of that, they always exceed what our models tell us</p>
<p t="8391310" d="930">they&#39;re going to do.</p>
<p t="8392240" d="4510">Or, they always transform themselves in some ungainly way</p>
<p t="8396750" d="2450">so that we don&#39;t get what we want.</p>
<p t="8399200" d="4320">So then the question is, well, how do you best deal with complexity?</p>
<p t="8403520" d="2280">And the reason I think truth is so useful</p>
<p t="8405800" d="4380">is because generally it reduces complexity.</p>
<p t="8410180" d="3390">I mean, one of the things that&#39;s really useful about trying</p>
<p t="8413570" d="3090">to say things that you believe to be true</p>
<p t="8416660" d="2777">is you don&#39;t have to remember what you said.</p>
<p t="8419437" d="1333">It&#39;s like, well, what did I say?</p>
<p t="8420770" d="3280">Well, I don&#39;t know, but I was trying to explain things properly.</p>
<p t="8424050" d="3320">Then you don&#39;t have to tear through all your rationalizations</p>
<p t="8427370" d="2490">and think about what you have to keep track of.</p>
<p t="8429860" d="2460">Deceptions, they grow.</p>
<p t="8432320" d="2360">They&#39;re like [? hydras. ?] So well, don&#39;t do that.</p>
<p t="8434680" d="960">OK.</p>
<p t="8435640" d="1930">Truth, simpler.</p>
<p t="8437570" d="2100">That&#39;s one big advantage.</p>
<p t="8439670" d="4290">You And people can say, well, truth isn&#39;t always the answer.</p>
<p t="8443960" d="4260">Well, there are sometimes you get into a situation that&#39;s so awful.</p>
<p t="8448220" d="5250">You&#39;ve made so many mistakes that not only would it</p>
<p t="8453470" d="2970">be very difficult for truth to rescue you,</p>
<p t="8456440" d="2360">you&#39;ve already warped your character to such a degree</p>
<p t="8458800" d="1250">that you couldn&#39;t even use it.</p>
<p t="8460050" d="1490">Well, you had it.</p>
<p t="8461540" d="3270">You You&#39;re off the radar at that point and nothing short of a miracle</p>
<p t="8464810" d="1620">would save you.</p>
<p t="8466430" d="5160">SPEAKER 1: To what degree do you think that, 1, the lessons that you&#39;ve</p>
<p t="8471590" d="6030">extrapolated and you&#39;ve put into words are easily</p>
<p t="8477620" d="3870">applied across various cultures that you may not have necessarily addressed</p>
<p t="8481490" d="2060">in your examination of mythology?</p>
<p t="8483550" d="1750">And I&#39;m challenging you a little bit here,</p>
<p t="8485300" d="1791">but just because it&#39;s an interesting topic.</p>
<p t="8489560" d="2700">For instance, Islam just doesn&#39;t feature at all in the work</p>
<p t="8492260" d="5420">that you&#39;ve written as I read, but it&#39;s a hugely important religion</p>
<p t="8497680" d="1290">on a global scale.</p>
<p t="8498970" d="3720">And even in countries like Canada.</p>
<p t="8502690" d="3810">And then, there&#39;s also the question of, with so many people</p>
<p t="8506500" d="5430">coming with different, specific mythologies or embodiments</p>
<p t="8511930" d="3870">of the universal mythology that we&#39;re discussing, what are the--</p>
<p t="8515800" d="3322">I mean, this is sort of a unique episode of human history</p>
<p t="8519122" d="1958">in the sense of just the scale and the rapidity</p>
<p t="8521080" d="2730">with which people are come into coming with each other</p>
<p t="8523810" d="2250">from very different backgrounds.</p>
<p t="8526060" d="4360">So what do you see as the implications of that, for good or for bad,</p>
<p t="8530420" d="1500">in a country like Canada--</p>
<p t="8531920" d="290">JORDAN PETERSON: OK.</p>
<p t="8532210" d="2083">You mean the fact that people are coming together?</p>
<p t="8534293" d="3957">SPEAKER 1: Coming together, but from those very different cultural places</p>
<p t="8538250" d="4370">in which maybe there&#39;s a universal mythology that envelops all of them,</p>
<p t="8542620" d="4730">but the values and the particular embodiments of mythology that people</p>
<p t="8547350" d="2560">have grown up with are often very different.</p>
<p t="8549910" d="3480">And these can clash.</p>
<p t="8553390" d="1240">JORDAN PETERSON: Right.</p>
<p t="8554630" d="500">Tribal.</p>
<p t="8555130" d="1440">They clash tribally.</p>
<p t="8556570" d="1490">SPEAKER 1: Right, tribally.</p>
<p t="8558060" d="4152">I don&#39;t mean in the clash of civilizations sort of overblown way.</p>
<p t="8562212" d="1708">But I&#39;m just saying on a pragmatic level,</p>
<p t="8563920" d="2820">people are often operating in different psychological space.</p>
<p t="8566740" d="916">JORDAN PETERSON: Yeah.</p>
<p t="8567656" d="3974">Well, to some degree, the issue there is whether or not you can negotiate.</p>
<p t="8571630" d="3990">Because a society, a multicultural society, in many ways</p>
<p t="8575620" d="1650">is dependent on negotiation.</p>
<p t="8577270" d="2600">And here&#39;s another sort of axiom.</p>
<p t="8579870" d="2602">It&#39;s like tyranny, slavery, and negotiation.</p>
<p t="8582472" d="958">Those are your options.</p>
<p t="8583430" d="1040">You want to be a tyrant?</p>
<p t="8584470" d="602">Fine.</p>
<p t="8585072" d="958">You want to be a slave?</p>
<p t="8586030" d="1300">That&#39;s an option.</p>
<p t="8587330" d="2480">But if you don&#39;t want to be either of those, you negotiate.</p>
<p t="8589810" d="500">OK.</p>
<p t="8590310" d="1340">So how do you negotiate?</p>
<p t="8591650" d="2280">Well, partly, you pay attention.</p>
<p t="8593930" d="1270">So you listen.</p>
<p t="8595200" d="4630">And here&#39;s another way to think about it, just like the totalitarian assumes</p>
<p t="8599830" d="2540">that what he does will redeem him.</p>
<p t="8602370" d="4110">It&#39;s sort of the basis of terror management theory in some sense, right?</p>
<p t="8606480" d="2260">What you know protects you and keeps you safe.</p>
<p t="8608740" d="500">OK.</p>
<p t="8609240" d="2791">And so you want to tighten that up and you want to make it rigorous</p>
<p t="8612031" d="2409">and you don&#39;t want anything to exist outside of it.</p>
<p t="8614440" d="1560">OK.</p>
<p t="8616000" d="2760">So in some ways, you worship the great father.</p>
<p t="8618760" d="2070">That&#39;s a way of thinking about it.</p>
<p t="8620830" d="1740">Here&#39;s another way of thinking about it.</p>
<p t="8622570" d="2310">What you don&#39;t know will redeem you.</p>
<p t="8624880" d="730">Well, why?</p>
<p t="8625610" d="2560">Well, because you already know what you know.</p>
<p t="8628170" d="3110">And now, then you can ask yourself, well, is that enough?</p>
<p t="8631280" d="4290">And then, the answer to that is, well, what&#39;s the quality of your life?</p>
<p t="8635570" d="5760">If the quality of your life is what you want it to be, really, then what</p>
<p t="8641330" d="1752">you know is enough.</p>
<p t="8643082" d="2958">But the probability that your quality of life is what you want it to be</p>
<p t="8646040" d="3990">is very low because you&#39;re still prone to all sorts of suffering</p>
<p t="8650030" d="1860">and all sorts of ignorance.</p>
<p t="8651890" d="2720">And you know, you can face that forthrightly.</p>
<p t="8654610" d="2710">It&#39;s one of the things that didn&#39;t happen in the Soviet Union,</p>
<p t="8657320" d="2232">because everybody said, my quality of life is great.</p>
<p t="8659552" d="1458">We know everything we need to know.</p>
<p t="8661010" d="4794">When in reality, it was like abysmal, murderous, treacherous, deceitful.</p>
<p t="8665804" d="666">It was horrible.</p>
<p t="8666470" d="4650">But so what that meant was that in the Soviet Union, if you admitted to--</p>
<p t="8671120" d="4280">if you admitted to your own suffering, you were a traitor.</p>
<p t="8675400" d="2350">Well, that&#39;s hell.</p>
<p t="8677750" d="2610">So you can&#39;t even let your suffering be true.</p>
<p t="8680360" d="4290">Right Not only do you have to suffer, but you can&#39;t even admit it.</p>
<p t="8684650" d="1140">So back to listening.</p>
<p t="8685790" d="6630">It&#39;s like, well, if you assume that what you don&#39;t know is redemptive,</p>
<p t="8692420" d="1559">then you can listen.</p>
<p t="8693979" d="2041">You can listen because you never know, the person</p>
<p t="8696020" d="2100">might know something that you don&#39;t know.</p>
<p t="8698120" d="2700">And maybe that would be a useful something.</p>
<p t="8700820" d="3434">And maybe you have something to say that they don&#39;t know that would be useful.</p>
<p t="8704254" d="2416">Now, there&#39;s some presuppositions that go along with that.</p>
<p t="8706670" d="3360">It&#39;s like you have to be willing to meet the other person</p>
<p t="8710030" d="2430">in the space between cultures.</p>
<p t="8712460" d="3370">And you have to know how to operate in the space between cultures.</p>
<p t="8715830" d="2010">And that&#39;s part of the hero myth, by the way.</p>
<p t="8717840" d="2240">If you&#39;re a hero of the right form, you know</p>
<p t="8720080" d="3010">how to operate in the space between cultures.</p>
<p t="8723090" d="1520">Well, then how do you operate there?</p>
<p t="8724610" d="4420">Well, I think we know.</p>
<p t="8729030" d="2280">What makes cultures rich?</p>
<p t="8731310" d="1410">Trust.</p>
<p t="8732720" d="1550">What makes trust possible?</p>
<p t="8734270" d="1590">Honesty.</p>
<p t="8735860" d="2550">You want natural resources?</p>
<p t="8738410" d="2670">There&#39;s nothing more valuable than trust and honesty.</p>
<p t="8741080" d="3230">Why is the world poor?</p>
<p t="8744310" d="2850">Corruption, that&#39;s why.</p>
<p t="8747160" d="2910">All the poor countries, almost all the poor countries are corrupt.</p>
<p t="8750070" d="2890">Part of the reason they&#39;re poor is because they&#39;re corrupt.</p>
<p t="8752960" d="3760">Now, you might say, well, are the Western countries so uncorrupt?</p>
<p t="8756720" d="2320">It&#39;s like, well, they&#39;ve got their problems.</p>
<p t="8759040" d="3810">But generally, the answer is they&#39;re not corrupt.</p>
<p t="8762850" d="2460">So eBay&#39;s a good example of that.</p>
<p t="8765310" d="4350">Because when eBay first emerged, people thought, you send me junk</p>
<p t="8769660" d="2190">and I send you a check that bounces.</p>
<p t="8771850" d="1770">So that&#39;s the end of eBay, right?</p>
<p t="8773620" d="4260">So these third-party-- I can&#39;t remember what they&#39;re called--</p>
<p t="8777880" d="5650">agents set themselves up so that you could pay them a fraction of the price,</p>
<p t="8783530" d="2330">and they would get the check and the product,</p>
<p t="8785860" d="2340">validate them, and ship them off.</p>
<p t="8788200" d="2920">And you know, they&#39;d take 10%, or whatever.</p>
<p t="8791120" d="2810">There&#39;s a particular name for people who do that.</p>
<p t="8793930" d="790">It&#39;s a profession.</p>
<p t="8794720" d="3200">Anyways, what happened was the average rate of honesty on eBay</p>
<p t="8797920" d="1560">was so high that that was useless.</p>
<p t="8799480" d="4320">It&#39;s like, the default was, I won&#39;t screw you.</p>
<p t="8803800" d="2220">And that was between strangers who had never met.</p>
<p t="8806020" d="4061">And even more weirdly, were never going to engage in another transaction.</p>
<p t="8810081" d="1999">So what that meant was that eBay all of a sudden</p>
<p t="8812080" d="3030">became insanely valuable because people would trade property.</p>
<p t="8815110" d="4150">Now, reputation markers soon evolved.</p>
<p t="8819260" d="6840">And I do believe that in the West, the default is you won&#39;t screw me.</p>
<p t="8826100" d="3770">And that means that I can trust your persona.</p>
<p t="8829870" d="3750">If the default is you will screw me, then I&#39;m a barrel of snakes</p>
<p t="8833620" d="2760">and you&#39;re a barrel of snakes, and we will never get anywhere.</p>
<p t="8836380" d="1260">SPEAKER 1: Exactly.</p>
<p t="8837640" d="5040">I mean, if we talk about the state of the world, most of humanity</p>
<p t="8842680" d="3210">does not live in the West, where the default assumption is,</p>
<p t="8845890" d="1890">I can probably trust this person.</p>
<p t="8847780" d="3435">What are the lessons to learn from what you&#39;re arguing</p>
<p t="8851215" d="4162">and from what you&#39;ve extrapolated from your experience for these contexts?</p>
<p t="8855377" d="833">JORDAN PETERSON: OK.</p>
<p t="8856210" d="4380">I mean, I can only speak about that at the most general level.</p>
<p t="8860590" d="3376">Because what to do in any particular circumstance, that&#39;s</p>
<p t="8863966" d="2874">the sort of problem I deal with in my clinical practice all the time.</p>
<p t="8866840" d="3740">It&#39;s like, here&#39;s this insanely complicated circumstance.</p>
<p t="8870580" d="2370">It usually has nothing to do with mental illness.</p>
<p t="8872950" d="4050">It&#39;s just the person is caught in something ridiculously complex,</p>
<p t="8877000" d="3200">like their aunt is sick at home.</p>
<p t="8880200" d="1900">Their husband just lost his job.</p>
<p t="8882100" d="1080">And they have an illness.</p>
<p t="8883180" d="930">It&#39;s like, oh my god.</p>
<p t="8884110" d="1470">That&#39;s horrible.</p>
<p t="8885580" d="1620">Are they mentally ill?</p>
<p t="8887200" d="690">No.</p>
<p t="8887890" d="1750">It&#39;s just awful.</p>
<p t="8889640" d="3430">So how do you weave your way through an awful situation?</p>
<p t="8893070" d="2620">Well, the particulars matter a lot.</p>
<p t="8895690" d="2160">And so you have to do strategic analysis,</p>
<p t="8897850" d="2891">paying attention to the details.</p>
<p t="8900741" d="499">OK.</p>
<p t="8901240" d="1050">So that&#39;s the particular.</p>
<p t="8902290" d="1830">So what&#39;s the general case?</p>
<p t="8904120" d="8740">Well, the general case is maybe don&#39;t falsify your relationship</p>
<p t="8912860" d="4700">with being to the degree that you can manage that.</p>
<p t="8917560" d="6820">Now, one of the things that I tell my students is, try solving a problem.</p>
<p t="8924380" d="3100">Fixing it, not trying to solve a problem.</p>
<p t="8927480" d="2420">But you know, you&#39;re going to fix it.</p>
<p t="8929900" d="1950">And you can fix it.</p>
<p t="8931850" d="1320">And it&#39;s a problem.</p>
<p t="8933170" d="1570">And you know it&#39;s a problem.</p>
<p t="8934740" d="500">OK.</p>
<p t="8935240" d="1530">So there&#39;s like a precondition here.</p>
<p t="8936770" d="4020">So let&#39;s say there&#39;s a bunch of things around you that bug you.</p>
<p t="8940790" d="1590">And you think, hm.</p>
<p t="8942380" d="1170">Those things bug me.</p>
<p t="8943550" d="630">Why?</p>
<p t="8944180" d="2280">Well, you don&#39;t know, but they bug you.</p>
<p t="8946460" d="2400">And you might think, well, is one of those things</p>
<p t="8948860" d="2405">that bug me something I could fix?</p>
<p t="8951265" d="1555">And you might think well, yeah.</p>
<p t="8952820" d="4440">And there&#39;s another part, which is not only could I fix it, I would fix it.</p>
<p t="8957260" d="2581">Because you can think, well, I could fix that, but I won&#39;t.</p>
<p t="8959841" d="2249">If you&#39;re being honest, you know you just won&#39;t do it.</p>
<p t="8962090" d="3100">But there&#39;s often something that you would fix.</p>
<p t="8965190" d="1010">Start there.</p>
<p t="8966200" d="1380">Fix it.</p>
<p t="8967580" d="1310">Then, try again.</p>
<p t="8968890" d="2560">Try to see if there&#39;s something else you can fix.</p>
<p t="8971450" d="6610">So if you&#39;re going to beat the lie, you have to start with what you can do.</p>
<p t="8978060" d="3250">And you start locally, like right locally.</p>
<p t="8981310" d="4520">And you can tell it&#39;s the right amount of local because it bugs you.</p>
<p t="8985830" d="3300">You could fix it and you will fix it.</p>
<p t="8989130" d="690">So perfect.</p>
<p t="8989820" d="974">That&#39;s your problem.</p>
<p t="8990794" d="1666">That&#39;s exactly your problem right there.</p>
<p t="8992460" d="900">Fix it.</p>
<p t="8993360" d="1859">Well then, everything shifts a little bit.</p>
<p t="8995219" d="1291">Everything around you is just--</p>
<p t="8996510" d="3360">the balance between chaos and order is a little better.</p>
<p t="8999870" d="2130">Well, the same thing applies to your speech.</p>
<p t="9002000" d="1689">It&#39;s like, OK.</p>
<p t="9003689" d="2541">I have to lie here because otherwise I&#39;m going to get killed.</p>
<p t="9006230" d="3480">It&#39;s like, OK, well, maybe that&#39;s not the place to start.</p>
<p t="9009710" d="1631">Maybe that&#39;s just foolhardy.</p>
<p t="9011341" d="499">OK.</p>
<p t="9011840" d="2610">Would I say that you should lie in that situation?</p>
<p t="9014450" d="1980">I would say, I can&#39;t tell because I&#39;m not</p>
<p t="9016430" d="2074">in the situation and the particulars matter.</p>
<p t="9018504" d="1166">So I don&#39;t know what to say.</p>
<p t="9019670" d="2040">That situation might be so awful that there&#39;s</p>
<p t="9021710" d="2670">nothing you can do that isn&#39;t awful.</p>
<p t="9024380" d="2030">How about in your own home?</p>
<p t="9026410" d="2200">How about in relationship to yourself?</p>
<p t="9028610" d="3687">It&#39;s like, how about you start fixing up the little micro-lies that you leave</p>
<p t="9032297" d="1833">lying around everywhere, and then it&#39;s going</p>
<p t="9034130" d="2880">to make you tougher and more formidable?</p>
<p t="9037010" d="3180">You keep practicing that for like 15 years,</p>
<p t="9040190" d="5769">and then maybe you&#39;ll be able to start to address some of the larger problems.</p>
<p t="9045959" d="2791">Maybe you&#39;ll even start to understand what the larger problems are.</p>
<p t="9048750" d="2810">Because that&#39;s a problem with prematurely trying to do too much,</p>
<p t="9051560" d="500">right?</p>
<p t="9052060" d="2060">It&#39;s like, well, is that really the problem?</p>
<p t="9054120" d="2730">And what makes you think you&#39;ll make it better rather than worse?</p>
<p t="9056850" d="2350">So you got to pick the right-sized problem.</p>
<p t="9059200" d="5090">So I would say, start with little weights and work yourself up.</p>
<p t="9064290" d="2640">And that&#39;s how you develop competence, anyways.</p>
<p t="9066930" d="3940">If you&#39;re going to figure out how to set things straight,</p>
<p t="9070870" d="3740">you might as well start where you can set them straight.</p>
<p t="9074610" d="1750">And you might think, well, that&#39;s trivial.</p>
<p t="9076360" d="1350">It&#39;s like, it&#39;s not trivial.</p>
<p t="9077710" d="1350">You might think it&#39;s trivial.</p>
<p t="9079060" d="1800">You have no idea how important it might be</p>
<p t="9080860" d="4920">that you straighten up your relationship with your wife or your son.</p>
<p t="9085780" d="2820">You have no idea what that might lead to.</p>
<p t="9088600" d="4644">Just think of what Stalin&#39;s relationship with his father led to.</p>
<p t="9093244" d="1566">Well, it was awful.</p>
<p t="9094810" d="750">There&#39;s Stalin.</p>
<p t="9095560" d="2580">He killed like 60 million people.</p>
<p t="9098140" d="2650">His father was a brute.</p>
<p t="9100790" d="2340">So that seemed reasonably important.</p>
<p t="9103130" d="3460">Maybe he shouldn&#39;t have been a brute.</p>
<p t="9106590" d="2730">So you know how horrible things can be if you do things wrong.</p>
<p t="9109320" d="2320">It&#39;s like, well, how good can they be if you do things right?</p>
<p t="9111640" d="625">You don&#39;t know.</p>
<p t="9112265" d="1525">Try starting.</p>
<p t="9113790" d="1320">It&#39;s like, see what happens.</p>
<p t="9115110" d="4500">My experience has been that to the degree</p>
<p t="9119610" d="5080">that I&#39;m able to speak carefully--</p>
<p t="9124690" d="1630">and I do speak carefully.</p>
<p t="9126320" d="4470">And I don&#39;t really care about the consequences.</p>
<p t="9130790" d="1560">It isn&#39;t that they don&#39;t matter.</p>
<p t="9132350" d="4650">It&#39;s that I&#39;m not speaking to produce a consequence.</p>
<p t="9137000" d="4530">I&#39;m just trying to say what seems to me to be the case.</p>
<p t="9141530" d="6690">For me, that&#39;s been incredibly, ridiculously, practically useful.</p>
<p t="9148220" d="1180">Insanely useful.</p>
<p t="9149400" d="4790">Like it&#39;s opened doors that I would have never dreamed of opening.</p>
<p t="9154190" d="3690">And in my professional life, it&#39;s produced all sorts of opportunities.</p>
<p t="9157880" d="2370">And it&#39;s been a real aid in my private life, too.</p>
<p t="9160250" d="2020">And in my professional life.</p>
<p t="9162270" d="1850">It&#39;s not like I don&#39;t make mistakes.</p>
<p t="9164120" d="2790">I don&#39;t think that I am--</p>
<p t="9166910" d="4440">I would never think of myself as fundamentally a good person.</p>
<p t="9171350" d="3860">I think maybe I&#39;m fundamentally a bad person.</p>
<p t="9175210" d="1630">Because you know, I have dark thoughts.</p>
<p t="9176840" d="3690">And I&#39;m quite temperamental.</p>
<p t="9184040" d="1860">Anyways.</p>
<p t="9185900" d="1770">I do what I can to deal with all that.</p>
<p t="9187670" d="1260">And I don&#39;t do it perfectly.</p>
<p t="9188930" d="4470">And I slide backwards, mostly by avoidance.</p>
<p t="9193400" d="3382">I don&#39;t always stay on top of the things I should stay on top of.</p>
<p t="9196782" d="8608">But to the degree that I&#39;ve been able to adhere to this mode of being,</p>
<p t="9205390" d="3780">I can&#39;t think of a single thing that&#39;s happened that hasn&#39;t been--</p>
<p t="9212490" d="3810">in some ways, beyond my expectations.</p>
<p t="9216300" d="2700">And it&#39;s really fun talking to the students.</p>
<p t="9219000" d="2640">Because it&#39;s fun with the lectures because when</p>
<p t="9221640" d="1950">I&#39;m talking about the mythological material,</p>
<p t="9223590" d="3849">and I can sort of sort out the stories, I can just</p>
<p t="9227439" d="1291">see lights going on everywhere.</p>
<p t="9228730" d="980">It&#39;s like, click.</p>
<p t="9229710" d="2040">You know, you can see it&#39;s like--</p>
<p t="9231750" d="1800">you can tell when someone has an insight.</p>
<p t="9233550" d="1740">I think they open their eyes a bit more.</p>
<p t="9235290" d="3540">Maybe that&#39;s it because it&#39;s a bit of a surprise, so you can detect it.</p>
<p t="9238830" d="1350">And it is like light going on.</p>
<p t="9240180" d="4664">And so I&#39;ll walk someone, say, through this Egyptian story-- an audience--</p>
<p t="9244844" d="2416">and they just go click, click, click, click, click, click.</p>
<p t="9247260" d="790">It&#39;s fun.</p>
<p t="9248050" d="2360">It&#39;s really fun.</p>
<p t="9250410" d="2980">And people seem to respond to it positively,</p>
<p t="9253390" d="3005">which I&#39;ve always been completely surprised about.</p>
<p t="9256395" d="2625">I can&#39;t believe that I&#39;ve been able to lecture about the things</p>
<p t="9259020" d="5760">that I lecture about without running mightily afoul of something.</p>
<p t="9264780" d="6020">Because my classes are quite different than the standard psychology</p>
<p t="9270800" d="1890">class or the standard university class.</p>
<p t="9272690" d="3460">They&#39;re very different.</p>
<p t="9276150" d="920">I don&#39;t know.</p>
<p t="9277070" d="4260">So far, it seems to be working, which is a surprise to me.</p>
<p t="9285660" d="4430">So that&#39;s what I would say to people, is like select the domain</p>
<p t="9290090" d="1800">in which you can act.</p>
<p t="9291890" d="4660">Straighten it up first, and that&#39;ll transform things a bit.</p>
<p t="9296550" d="2317">You put your house in order.</p>
<p t="9298867" d="2833">Then, you can start to put your town in order, or maybe your street,</p>
<p t="9301700" d="958">or maybe your neighbor.</p>
<p t="9302658" d="1592">God only knows.</p>
<p t="9304250" d="2810">Start where you can start.</p>
<p t="9307060" d="2217">And you might think, well, what&#39;s that?</p>
<p t="9309277" d="2833">Well, it&#39;s nothing you can wave a placard in the street about, which</p>
<p t="9312110" d="790">is a good thing.</p>
<p t="9312900" d="1910">That&#39;s like praying in public.</p>
<p t="9314810" d="2460">This is more like praying in private.</p>
<p t="9317270" d="3550">Fix up what you can fix up, and see what happens.</p>
<p t="9320820" d="3910">And I don&#39;t think that there&#39;s anything that&#39;s more powerful than that.</p>
