<p t="660" d="2000">So, how are we going to do this?</p>
<p t="2660" d="1440">Are people just going to ask?</p>
<p t="4920" d="1160">All right.</p>
<p t="8160" d="980">Yes</p>
<p t="10020" d="6140">&quot;You have said that speech brings order out of chaos&quot;</p>
<p t="16380" d="3460">&quot;That&#39;s why free speech is important&quot;</p>
<p t="20040" d="4480">&quot;But why does it appear that speech brings chaos out of order?&quot;</p>
<p t="25920" d="1440">So you would ask that.</p>
<p t="27360" d="1040">The question is...</p>
<p t="28720" d="920">*laughter*</p>
<p t="30440" d="4520">The question is:  Speech brings order out of chaos</p>
<p t="34960" d="1560">--That&#39;s what I said--</p>
<p t="36800" d="3920">but it appears that speech brings chaos out of order as well</p>
<p t="41040" d="2240">and the answer to that is- it does.</p>
<p t="43560" d="4320">There is only so many complications I can address in the talk simultaneously</p>
<p t="48240" d="2000">umm.... if you look at</p>
<p t="50240" d="3080">If you look at the most archaic of archetypal heroes</p>
<p t="53320" d="3480">Those heroes confront something 
that represents chaos</p>
<p t="57120" d="3840">It&#39;s usually a monster that bears a treasure of some sort</p>
<p t="60960" d="4480">and that&#39;s a symbolic representation of the class of all unexplored things</p>
<p t="65440" d="3720">because things that we have not yet explored are threatening and destructive</p>
<p t="69160" d="2440">but also offer us infinite potential</p>
<p t="72080" d="3160">but more elaborated hero stories, lets say</p>
<p t="75240" d="4840">also reverse that and say that- well there are times when the order has become so corrupt and rigid</p>
<p t="80080" d="2840">that free speech fragments it into its parts</p>
<p t="82920" d="1520">so that it can rejuvenate itself</p>
<p t="84960" d="500">and so...</p>
<p t="86160" d="1480">actually in the gospels</p>
<p t="87640" d="3680">that&#39;s the hero that Christ is basically represented as</p>
<p t="91440" d="5880">He&#39;s not so much the dragon confronting...the dragon slayer who gathers the treasure</p>
<p t="97320" d="4600">Although that&#39;s implicit in the juxtaposition of Christ with the figure of like a serpentile satan</p>
<p t="101920" d="3840">but Christ is the thing that stands 
up against the corrupt state</p>
<p t="105760" d="2120">and rejuvenates it through speech</p>
<p t="108600" d="1920">And so technically speaking</p>
<p t="110520" d="3840">free speech- the logos is the thing that mediates between chaos and order</p>
<p t="114840" d="1520">and you can think about</p>
<p t="116600" d="2040">this is represented in many cultures- this idea</p>
<p t="118880" d="4800">You can see it most specifically in the Taoist conceptualisation</p>
<p t="123960" d="5680">because in the Taoist world, being is made out of chaos and order, yin and yang, masculine and feminine</p>
<p t="130120" d="2080">fundamentally it&#39;s chaos and order</p>
<p t="132200" d="3920">and order is the fact that wherever you go, there are things you understand</p>
<p t="136120" d="3920">and chaos is- the fact that wherever you go, there are things that you don&#39;t understand</p>
<p t="140040" d="5480">And so the idea is that being is made out of the things that you understand and the things that you don&#39;t understand</p>
<p t="145520" d="1720">and it&#39;s always that way</p>
<p t="147480" d="2880">which is why Tao is the symbol of being per se</p>
<p t="151040" d="1160">and it&#39;s the case</p>
<p t="152200" d="1520">Your brain is adapted in fact</p>
<p t="153720" d="2300">it&#39;s partly why it has two hemispheres--</p>
<p t="156020" d="2940">for the world that you understand, and the world you don&#39;t understand</p>
<p t="158960" d="3760">the world you understand, roughly speaking, being handled by the left</p>
<p t="162720" d="3320">the world you don&#39;t understand, roughly speaking, being handled by the right</p>
<p t="166480" d="5340">Well it&#39;s that line down the middle that&#39;s Tao.  That&#39;s meaning.</p>
<p t="171920" d="4360">And if you have one foot in chaos and one foot in order, you&#39;re maximising information flow</p>
<p t="176280" d="3480">and rejuvenating yourself at the same time that you&#39;re maintaining your structure</p>
<p t="180200" d="4400">and you will report on that internally as engagement in the world.</p>
<p t="185080" d="2620">It&#39;s the most fundamental orienting sense that you have.</p>
<p t="187700" d="2800">and it&#39;s deeply instantiated neurologically--</p>
<p t="190500" d="1780">unbelievably deeply.</p>
<p t="192360" d="1600">And so it really is the case</p>
<p t="193960" d="1960">from an evolutionary perspective</p>
<p t="195920" d="2080">that reality is chaos and order.</p>
<p t="198280" d="2240">It&#39;s that to which you&#39;re adapted.</p>
<p t="200520" d="2880">And so sometimes you are speaking on behalf of chaos,</p>
<p t="203400" d="1920">and sometimes you are speaking on behalf of order.</p>
<p t="205600" d="2060">It&#39;s more complicated than that too, though, because...</p>
<p t="207700" d="2300">when we have a dialogue, say,</p>
<p t="210100" d="3440">and we&#39;re mutually attempting 
to climb towards the truth</p>
<p t="213540" d="2740">instead of convincing each other that we&#39;re right...</p>
<p t="216960" d="6740">then what we are doing is engaging in the simultaneous fragmentation of old and archaic belief systems,</p>
<p t="223700" d="2840">and they&#39;re updated.
And you can experience that--</p>
<p t="226540" d="3380">because someone will say 
something that sets you back</p>
<p t="229920" d="2200">and then you&#39;ll get what they&#39;re saying,
 and it will CLICK together.</p>
<p t="232200" d="5200">And what you are experiencing is the death of an old conceptualisation structure</p>
<p t="237480" d="5440">(its disintegration), and then its 
re-configuration in a tighter order.</p>
<p t="243280" d="1800">And people love that.  They live for that.</p>
<p t="245080" d="3060">It&#39;s--  Really, it&#39;s what keeps you ALIVE.</p>
<p t="248140" d="2280">And you can experience that in a deep conversation,</p>
<p t="250420" d="3860">a truthful conversation,
a meeting of the minds and soul.</p>
<p t="254640" d="4000">And people love that.  It&#39;s curative.
All psychotherapists know this.</p>
<p t="258640" d="6840">Because, what you do in psychotherapy, in addition to helping people face the things that they&#39;re most afraid of</p>
<p t="265480" d="2440">so that they can overcome them</p>
<p t="267960" d="2720">is to allow them to tell someone the truth.</p>
<p t="271120" d="2560">&quot;What happened to you?  I&#39;ll listen...&quot;</p>
<p t="274040" d="1560">So they tell you.</p>
<p t="275600" d="2240">And they take themselves apart, and 
put themselves together,</p>
<p t="277840" d="3140">while they&#39;re speaking the truth about what happened.</p>
<p t="281520" d="1900">And it puts them together.</p>
<p t="283860" d="3820">The two fundamental elements of psychotherapy are...</p>
<p t="287680" d="1680">Let&#39;s find what you&#39;re afraid of and avoiding,</p>
<p t="289360" d="1620">and help you confront it,</p>
<p t="290980" d="2940">so that you can gather the information that&#39;s there...</p>
<p t="294480" d="5160">And...  Let&#39;s allow you to lay your story out in all of its catastrophe and detail</p>
<p t="299640" d="2440">so that you can straighten yourself out through speech.</p>
<p t="302080" d="2820">It&#39;s exactly what happens in psychotherapy.</p>
<p t="305020" d="3280">And it should happen in every real relationship.</p>
<p t="308300" d="3420">It&#39;s the spiritual purpose of a marriage, fundamentally, right?</p>
<p t="311720" d="3480">Because you face someone who&#39;s different than you, that you&#39;re tied to</p>
<p t="315200" d="2560">--and cannot run from--and so...
**laughter**</p>
<p t="317760" d="3220">you can reveal yourself...
Really, really...  It&#39;s a critical--</p>
<p t="320980" d="3120">It&#39;s a critical part of marriage.  Because if you can run,</p>
<p t="324100" d="3460">from someone they will never show you their true face.</p>
<p t="327560" d="3740">Because if someone shows you their TRUE face... you WILL run.</p>
<p t="331580" d="6560">And so you say in a marriage ceremony, &quot;I will allow you to show me your true face, and I will not run.&quot;</p>
<p t="338880" d="3360">And unless you mean that, you&#39;ll never be married.</p>
<p t="342240" d="3880">You&#39;ll never understand what it means.  And you&#39;ll never reap the benefits of it,</p>
<p t="346120" d="4300">which are practical, obviously, but also spiritual and psychological.</p>
<p t="351060" d="3280">There&#39;s a reason for the vow, but it HAS to be a vow.</p>
<p t="354340" d="4800">&#39;Cause otherwise you have a back door open, and you&#39;ll never really tell the person what you&#39;re like.</p>
<p t="359140" d="2440">And, and no bloody wonder, because really...</p>
<p t="361580" d="2040">who really wants to know what you&#39;re like?</p>
<p t="364080" d="3120">**laughter**
Not even you... that&#39;s for sure.</p>
<p t="370420" d="1920">So, I&#39;m not surprised for...</p>
<p t="372340" d="3600">I want to thank you, because what was surprising about your lecture today</p>
<p t="375940" d="3920">was this concept of altruism.  I think you were able to put everything together</p>
<p t="379860" d="3160">and at the end come out with a higher value of altruism.</p>
<p t="383720" d="3360">And, to me it was a surprise, you know &lt;inaudible&gt;.</p>
<p t="387080" d="3840">And I have a relationship with altruism, and the one that I find that&#39;s difficult for me</p>
<p t="390920" d="3320">is that there&#39;s an evolutionary process of my brain--</p>
<p t="394240" d="2240">it&#39;s an organ, it&#39;s developed, you know?</p>
<p t="397520" d="4160">And I&#39;m amazed at how often I think of 3 people: me, myself and I.</p>
<p t="402840" d="6800">To the point where I&#39;ve actually written down--counted--all the iterations of &quot;me, myself, and I&quot;</p>
<p t="409640" d="2700">in either my thoughts or my speech or even in someone else&#39;s</p>
<p t="412340" d="1360">And you&#39;ll get a PAGE...</p>
<p t="413700" d="1940">And sometimes we&#39;ll think of &quot;we&quot;.</p>
<p t="415640" d="4200">And as far as I&#39;ve been able to ascertain, it&#39;s because I have to expend energy</p>
<p t="420260" d="1920">to think about someone else.</p>
<p t="424320" d="560">And yet,</p>
<p t="425500" d="2080">I&#39;m adicted to ease and comfort</p>
<p t="427580" d="2240">because my natural evolution is one of ease and comfort.</p>
<p t="429820" d="4480">You hear it in Alcoholic&#39;s Anonymous, &quot;Well, booze ain&#39;t the problem.  You&#39;re addicted to ease and comfort.&quot;</p>
<p t="435100" d="2880">How do I overcome my--</p>
<p t="438020" d="4040">what I think is my sense of ease and comfort</p>
<p t="442100" d="4860">to be able to make altruism a 
more natural state of being?</p>
<p t="447420" d="1660">Jordan:  Good, good-- Good question.</p>
<p t="450160" d="3360">So, the question is-- the first was a comment about</p>
<p t="454320" d="2720">the emphasis in my talk today on altruism</p>
<p t="457040" d="6460">and the second is, &quot;How do I--how do people overcome their proclivity to only act on their own behalf?&quot;</p>
<p t="463640" d="2800">OK, so ... the first thing I will say is that</p>
<p t="466440" d="4560">I don&#39;t believe that what I spoke about today was in favor of altruism</p>
<p t="472020" d="3520">And, that&#39;s not a negative comment on your question.</p>
<p t="477720" d="3920">But there&#39;s ...   So here&#39;s a primary religious injunction:</p>
<p t="481640" d="3840">Treat the other person like you would like to be treated yourself.</p>
<p t="485980" d="2960">That does not mean &quot;be nice to other people&quot;.</p>
<p t="488940" d="4380">It does not mean &quot;sacrifice yourself excessively for other people&quot;.</p>
<p t="494780" d="4000">It means... Think about the other person as if they were YOU,</p>
<p t="498780" d="4800">and figure out how you can mutually interact to better both of you at the same time.</p>
<p t="503580" d="2420">You have to build yourself into the equation.</p>
<p t="506560" d="1440">It&#39;s an equation.</p>
<p t="508780" d="2640">It&#39;s not that others are more valuable,</p>
<p t="511420" d="2260">it&#39;s that we&#39;re ALL valuable.  We&#39;re equally valuable.</p>
<p t="513680" d="2220">And then you think &quot;well, how do you remind yourself of that?&quot;</p>
<p t="515900" d="2640">And the answer to that is, through terror.</p>
<p t="519280" d="2480">Because terror is the genuine motivator.</p>
<p t="521760" d="900">So they say--</p>
<p t="522820" d="2960">&quot;Fear of god is the beginning of all wisdom.&quot;</p>
<p t="525780" d="1640">Well, what does that mean?</p>
<p t="527420" d="3040">It means, first, that you don&#39;t get away with anything.</p>
<p t="530460" d="3720">And it&#39;s really useful to know that, because if you really know that,</p>
<p t="534200" d="2080">you won&#39;t TRY to get away with--</p>
<p t="536280" d="1640">well, you still will--because people are stupid--but,</p>
<p t="537920" d="3920">**laughter**
but at least it will mitigate the possibility.  So--</p>
<p t="542260" d="4640">Here, I&#39;ll tell you something that Jung said.  This is quite profound.</p>
<p t="546900" d="2640">And I think it&#39;s the right answer to this question.</p>
<p t="549600" d="4800">Yung believed-- He was interested in the emergence of higher morality.</p>
<p t="554400" d="4680">--something the developmental psychologist Piaget was also interested in--</p>
<p t="559080" d="4700">Piaget thought... we started out as individuals, then we learned to play games with other people.</p>
<p t="563780" d="4300">Kids--children--learned how to play games with other children, and that made them social.</p>
<p t="568080" d="2720">So, our society is a game, it&#39;s a giant game.</p>
<p t="571480" d="3200">That we&#39;re all playing together, voluntarily.</p>
<p t="574680" d="2360">And so children will first learn how to play the game,</p>
<p t="577040" d="2540">and only later did they learn the rules of the game.</p>
<p t="579580" d="4020">They learned how to play the game first, and then learned the rules--how to SPEAK the rules.</p>
<p t="583600" d="3820">And then at some point they realized that they were also creators of the rules.</p>
<p t="588960" d="1120">And so that&#39;s ...</p>
<p t="590080" d="1460">... moral development...</p>
<p t="592260" d="5280">... on a continual-- or, not a continual... it&#39;s a fractured staircase upward.</p>
<p t="598020" d="1760">But Jung was interested in</p>
<p t="599780" d="2800">elements of moral action that were higher than that, so...</p>
<p t="602720" d="3680">he conceptualized it symbolically.  So imagine this--</p>
<p t="606400" d="3420">He did this in the last book he wrote, called &quot;Mysterium Coniunctionis&quot;.</p>
<p t="611960" d="1040">So imagine that</p>
<p t="613000" d="4620">you exist so that your conceptual structures and your emotions are in uneasy relationship with one another.</p>
<p t="617620" d="3140">So you&#39;re kind of a house divided ... amongst yourself.</p>
