<p t="2970" d="3630">I talked a little bit last time about what
we were going to cover but we didn't get</p>
<p t="6600" d="3520">quite through it so I'm going to finish
that. For those of you who weren't here</p>
<p t="10120" d="6130">last time you can watch the lecture because
it's online. So, we stopped at the depth</p>
<p t="16250" d="5909">psychologists, really, and those are the psychoanalysts.
And psychoanalysts are people who are concerned</p>
<p t="22159" d="7731">with—well, for a psychoanalyst, roughly speaking,
you're a collection of loosely integrated</p>
<p t="29890" d="5210">spirits. That's one way of thinking about
it—or sub personalities. You're not a</p>
<p t="35100" d="5000">unity. And those subpersonalities have their
basis in, well in all sorts of things. They</p>
<p t="40100" d="6270">might have their basis in past especially
traumatic experience or in patterns of socialization</p>
<p t="46370" d="5070">that characterized your family, but they might
also have their basis in fundamental biological</p>
<p t="51440" d="7100">motivational systems. So, for example, a psychoanalyst
would contextualize anger, or perhaps sexual</p>
<p t="58540" d="5850">attraction, as a subpersonality. And the reason
for that is that—well you know what it's</p>
<p t="64390" d="5370">like when you get angry. You get angry at
someone you love and you know, first of all,</p>
<p t="69760" d="4870">you know, and it's some level you're wishing
harm. Now, that might only be that you want</p>
<p t="74630" d="4300">to win the argument and you want them to be
nicely crushed while you do it, but so there's</p>
<p t="78930" d="4020">a desire that comes along with the anger.
But there's a lot of other things that happen</p>
<p t="82950" d="4480">too. So, for example, if someone's annoying
you, even if you love them, the probability</p>
<p t="87430" d="4700">that at that moment you're going to be able
to easily access all the memories you have</p>
<p t="92130" d="5310">about how annoying they are and have difficult
time accessing the memories about how wonderful</p>
<p t="97440" d="3680">they've been to you is quite high. You know
and you know that because sometimes you get</p>
<p t="101120" d="3400">angry with someone and you have an argument
with them and you sort of clue in later, you</p>
<p t="104520" d="5510">snap out of your more or less possessed state
and you think, “Yeah, well you know, I really</p>
<p t="110030" d="5170">wasn't taking the context into mind and
I was kind of harsh.” So, well so and so</p>
<p t="115200" d="4310">then you think, “Well, who's in control.”
And that's the question the psychoanalysts</p>
<p t="119510" d="4770">are really interested in and their answer
is it's not generally you.</p>
<p t="124280" d="3949">And so it's very terrifying reading in some
sense because, you know, people like to think</p>
<p t="128229" d="6711">of themselves as masters of their own house
so to speak and it's just, it's only vaguely</p>
<p t="134940" d="7510">true. And, you know, people—you know that
too because you make maybe New Year's Eve—ah,</p>
<p t="142450" d="3380">what do you call those?—resolutions. How
you're going to be a better person. I think</p>
<p t="145830" d="3810">the most common ones is man, you're going
to hit the gym three times a week. It's</p>
<p t="149640" d="3959">like, “No, you're not actually!” And
so very few people do and that's partly</p>
<p t="153599" d="4250">because, well it's hard and so you don't
want to do hard things. And the reason for</p>
<p t="157849" d="3970">that is because they're hard, so it doesn't
take much explanation. But it's also because</p>
<p t="161819" d="4411">you can't just tell yourself what to do.
And that's annoying too because life would</p>
<p t="166230" d="4430">be a lot easier if you could just say, “Okay,
well you know, sit down, study for two hours,</p>
<p t="170660" d="4090">don't watch cats on YouTube—or whatever
it is that you're watching.” And no, no,</p>
<p t="174750" d="3099">no, that isn't what happens. You sit there
and you study for a while and then, you know,</p>
<p t="177849" d="3720">you're thinking about cats and the next
thing you know you're watching haunted mansions</p>
<p t="181569" d="8060">in London or some damn thing. You know, so
and it's a scary idea in some sense because</p>
<p t="189629" d="3481">if you think well, if you're not really
master of your own house, you know if you</p>
<p t="193110" d="4170">don't know yourself under full voluntary
control—and you certainly don't—then</p>
<p t="197280" d="1490">what does?</p>
<p t="198770" d="4820">And you know Freud is interesting in that
regard because he really talked about the</p>
<p t="203590" d="4440">motive powerful of fundamental motivational
systems. Mostly for Freud it was aggression</p>
<p t="208030" d="3630">and sexuality. And you know those are—those
are big motivators; let's make no mistake</p>
<p t="211660" d="6520">about it. And so he thought of you as—that
the conscious part of your personality maybe</p>
<p t="218180" d="5760">as the—it's like the caption of a ship
with a very unruly crew. It's a nice metaphor</p>
<p t="223940" d="3960">because of course the ship's on the ocean
and the oceans can be very stormy. And so</p>
<p t="227900" d="4470">you can only sort of plot your course and
you have to work with what's thrown at you.</p>
<p t="232370" d="5280">And then the unruly crew is—well, it's
all your drives. Drives is the wrong way of</p>
<p t="237650" d="6830">thinking about it. I like the psychoanalytic
notion of subpersonality because a subpersonality</p>
<p t="244480" d="6149">has a viewpoint, there's things it wants,
and it plans. So it's a living entity; it's</p>
<p t="250629" d="5190">not some dead cognitive system, you know.
So Freud was interested in some sense more</p>
<p t="255819" d="5581">about, I would say, the biological underpinnings
of the subpersonalities, you know. Because</p>
<p t="261400" d="4420">he was quite biologically oriented and he
realized that sexuality and aggression were</p>
<p t="265820" d="2750">very fundamental subpersonalities.</p>
<p t="268570" d="4310">And then there's Jung and Jung is much more
terrifying than Freud, which is really saying</p>
<p t="272880" d="5090">a lot because Freud's quite terrifying.
But Jung, he's just terrifying beyond belief.</p>
<p t="277970" d="6470">And, you know, for Jung the subpersonalities
that make you up are thousands and thousands</p>
<p t="284440" d="3680">of years old. They're cultural constructions
that are thousands and thousands of years</p>
<p t="288120" d="5269">old and they have you in their grip. So, for
Jung, for example, one of the things he said</p>
<p t="293389" d="4451">and I don't remember where it was—I love
this phrasing, it's so true. And you can</p>
<p t="297840" d="5230">think about this for like five years and you
can still think about it after that. One of</p>
<p t="303070" d="5490">the things that Jung said was that people
don't have ideas; ideas have people. And</p>
<p t="308560" d="4290">that's really something to think about because,
you know, just think about your own situation.</p>
<p t="312850" d="4039">So no doubt you have political views and you
think, “I have political views.” It's</p>
<p t="316889" d="4500">like, “Well, no you don't,” because
you share them with a lot of other people.</p>
<p t="321389" d="6611">So, they're certainly not yours. And not
only that, they've had a very lengthy historical</p>
<p t="328000" d="4530">development far before you ever showed up.
You know, so they're rooted—they're</p>
<p t="332530" d="4180">rooted right at the depths of your culture,
but then of course they've been elaborated</p>
<p t="336710" d="4530">by one philosopher or another extensively
over the last two or three hundred years and</p>
<p t="341240" d="4739">there's this whole system of thought and
poof! It inhabits you brain and then you think,</p>
<p t="345979" d="7241">“Well I've got political views.” It's
like, “No. The political views have you.”</p>
<p t="353220" d="5699">And that's a very salutary thought because
it's one of the ways to stop yourself from</p>
<p t="358919" d="4750">being possessed. Because people get possessed
all the time by ideas, right? That's what</p>
<p t="363669" d="4301">happened in Nazi Germany; that's what happened
in the Soviet Union. It happens everywhere</p>
<p t="367970" d="5600">all the time. And you might think, “Well,
possessed is a little strong,” but no it's</p>
<p t="373570" d="4610">not actually. It's a very nice—it's
a metaphor obviously, but it's the right</p>
<p t="378180" d="5510">kind of metaphor because a body of ideas like
political ideas, they're a living thing,</p>
<p t="383690" d="5920">you know. They're not some dead, dusty words
on a bookshelf somewhere; they're an integral</p>
<p t="389610" d="6119">part of a dynamic society. And the motive
force those ideas have motivates you. You're</p>
<p t="395729" d="5041">in their grip. And so, you can tell when you're
talking to someone who's completely possessed</p>
<p t="400770" d="4880">by an idea system or an ideological system
because they'll just bore you to death unless</p>
<p t="405650" d="4930">you happen to belief exactly the same thing.
So, they'll spout out a few of their fundamental</p>
<p t="410580" d="4770">belief axioms and then you can identify which
system they're part of. And then they just</p>
<p t="415350" d="4420">speak in clichés from that point onward and
you can predict everything they're going</p>
<p t="419770" d="6540">to say if you know the axioms of the system.
So, it's very—it's very non-authentic</p>
<p t="426310" d="6889">speech and that would be a way that say someone
like Rogers or Abraham Maslow, who were humanists</p>
<p t="433199" d="3970">of the 1960's, might talk about it. Because
the person isn't speaking from the depths</p>
<p t="437169" d="4141">of their own experience or from even their
embodied knowledge. You know, they're just</p>
<p t="441310" d="2630">mouthpieces for abstract ideas.</p>
<p t="443940" d="5650">And so it's very frightening to realize
the extent to which you can be the mouthpiece</p>
<p t="449590" d="4919">for abstract ideas, you know. And it's actually
one of the dangers of becoming educated, especially</p>
<p t="454509" d="3880">in a mass system like the university system,
because a lot of what happens when you come</p>
<p t="458389" d="7491">to university is that you're fed a set of
predigested ideas—I suppose that's one</p>
<p t="465880" d="4319">way of thinking about it, you know. And it's
very easy for you to think well that those</p>
<p t="470199" d="6431">are now you're ideas; they're not. They're
not. Lots of ideas you have to earn and if</p>
<p t="476630" d="4629">it's a great idea then you really have to
earn it. Because why should you be able to</p>
<p t="481259" d="4741">come along and like pluck up a great idea?
That's not how things work. You have to</p>
<p t="486000" d="2190">earn things that are valuable.</p>
<p t="488190" d="3870">So anyways, the depth psychologists, man they're
so good at that. It's lovely to read them.</p>
<p t="492060" d="3930">And the problem too is with a lot of people
we're going to talk about it's very difficult</p>
<p t="495990" d="5140">to summarize their work. You know, because
often the devil's in the details. So, you</p>
<p t="501130" d="3460">know, you might look at someone like Piaget
is a good example—the constructivist that</p>
<p t="504590" d="4250">we talked about briefly. Man, the guy wrote
dozens of books; you can't just summarize</p>
<p t="508840" d="5569">those suckers. It's not one coherent theory
that you can boil down to, you know, ten axioms</p>
<p t="514409" d="4141">and then you can read it while you're flying
from Toronto to Montreal and poof you're</p>
<p t="518550" d="4869">a Piagetian psychologist. Like, it doesn't
work like that. The people who formulated</p>
<p t="523419" d="6040">these theories were extremely intelligent
and they were often great writers. And so</p>
<p t="529459" d="4240">a lot of the knowledge is actually in the
writing itself and not in what you can extract</p>
<p t="533699" d="4990">out from the gist, you know. And most of the
theorists: Freud—Jung it's harder—but</p>
<p t="538689" d="4640">Freud, Rogers—people like that. You can
extract out the gist of their theories and</p>
<p t="543329" d="7930">then you can—ah, what would you say?—you
can stereotype it or you can caricature it</p>
<p t="551259" d="4260">and then you can point out how your caricature
is absurd and you can feel like you're even</p>
<p t="555519" d="5031">smarter than Freud. And, you know, you're
not. So, it's not a good idea. And so these</p>
<p t="560550" d="3969">people should also be approached with respect
because man they have so much to tell you.</p>
<p t="564519" d="1190">It's so useful.</p>
<p t="565709" d="5410">Okay, so we talked about the depth psychologists,
we talked about the constructivists; we didn't</p>
<p t="571119" d="4861">talk about the humanists and the existentialists
and the phenomenologists. It's a mouthful</p>
<p t="575980" d="6099">of words, you know, so let's put a little
bit of foundation under those. So, if you're</p>
<p t="582079" d="6050">a humanist—to be a humanist means really
to be a creature of the enlightenment. And</p>
<p t="588129" d="4031">a humanist thought in some sense—at least
this is what the humanists think—they think</p>
<p t="592160" d="6929">of it as post-religious. You know and they
think of humanistic thought as putting the</p>
<p t="599089" d="5420">value of the human being at the center of
the cosmos in some sense, valuing the person</p>
<p t="604509" d="8281">as they are, and then also valuing the person
that they could be and promoting the pathways</p>
<p t="612790" d="5139">of development that would allow people to
become what they could be as creatures that</p>
<p t="617929" d="7020">are valuable in their own right. So, a humanist,
for example, would be very skeptical of claims,</p>
<p t="624949" d="7500">so let's say standard Christian claims—and
I use that example because the realm of ideas</p>
<p t="632449" d="5690">that these thinkers emerged out of was almost
always Judeo-Christian. And, so, you know, the</p>
<p t="638139" d="3620">roots of their thinking are in those systems
and you can't understand their thinking</p>
<p t="641759" d="5651">without understanding that. So, part of humanism
was a rebellion against the idea that life</p>
<p t="647410" d="3959">on earth so to speak was of limited value
because anything of any importance was going</p>
<p t="651369" d="4880">to happen in the afterlife after you die.
So, it's like, “No, it's here and now.</p>
<p t="656249" d="4471">It's right now that matters. And you know,
life in the present is what's important,</p>
<p t="660720" d="4659">and you don't need some kind of afterlife
or some kind of belief in a transcendent reality</p>
<p t="665379" d="4640">in order to find value right here and now.”
So you know, fine. There's a lot of good</p>
<p t="670019" d="1380">things about that idea.</p>
<p t="671399" d="6211">You know and the whole idea that you can improve
yourself in some sense is a humanistic idea.</p>
<p t="677610" d="5930">And most of you—I mean how many of you believe
that can improve yourself? So, is there anybody</p>
<p t="683540" d="6159">who doesn't believe that that's willing
to admit it? So, usually people only don't</p>
<p t="689699" d="3800">believe that if they're very depressed or
hopeless. But it's not self-evident, you</p>
<p t="693499" d="4550">know, I mean and in many cultures—you could
think of medieval culture, for example, in</p>
<p t="698049" d="4330">Europe where you know you were sort of stuck
in your position—there was no real idea</p>
<p t="702379" d="4940">of self-improvement. You could try not to
sin but you weren't going to get like radically</p>
<p t="707319" d="5690">better in some way; you were just who you
were and that was that. But that's not the</p>
<p t="713009" d="1200">case with the humanists.</p>
<p t="714209" d="5670">Now, existentialists, they're kind of a
different kettle of fish. So, you know, when</p>
<p t="719879" d="4700">Freud talks about psychopathology—because
a lot of personality is about pathology, right,</p>
<p t="724579" d="4950">how personalities can go wrong—Freud kind
of thinks of the normal person, roughly speaking,</p>
<p t="729529" d="6160">as healthy in their normality, but perhaps
transformed into a pathological version of</p>
<p t="735689" d="4750">themselves by some sort of past trauma. And
that might often be an abusive childhood,</p>
<p t="740439" d="5020">you know, or maybe a sexually abusive childhood
because, you know, Freud talked a lot about</p>
<p t="745459" d="6951">that and it happens fairly frequently. So
for Freud, all things considered, if you weren't</p>
<p t="752410" d="4079">healthy there was a reason for it. You know,
something terrible has happened to you and</p>
<p t="756489" d="4130">you needed to come to terms with that terrible
thing, however you might do that, and put</p>
<p t="760619" d="4731">yourself back together and then you could
wander along being a healthy person. But the</p>
<p t="765350" d="4089">existentialists, that's not how they think
at all. They think the standard human being</p>
<p t="769439" d="6080">is pathological. And the reason they think
that is because they think that self-conscious</p>
<p t="775519" d="5891">existence, so life—the life of a creature
who knows it's bounded in time and space,</p>
<p t="781410" d="5529">right? Knows it's vulnerable to disease
and illness and death and the loss of things</p>
<p t="786939" d="5120">that they love. And the disintegration of
all things in some sense is—that's enough</p>
<p t="792059" d="5900">of a problem to give you problems without
having to have been abused by it. And so the</p>
<p t="797959" d="7201">existentialists view life itself as a problem
of sufficient magnitude that it can destabilize</p>
<p t="805160" d="4099">you mentally merely be being aware of it.</p>
<p t="809259" d="4600">And, so, they also believe that often what people
do as a consequence of that is flee from their</p>
<p t="813859" d="4340">own awareness. You know, so how do you deal
with the fact that life is suffering? Well,</p>
<p t="818199" d="4961">you don't think about it. Well, for an existentialist,
that's not a very good answer. And I would</p>
<p t="823160" d="4229">also say, generally speaking, for clinical
psychologists that's also not a very good</p>
<p t="827389" d="6331">answer because the literature suggests pretty
damn strongly that the harder you run from</p>
<p t="833720" d="5940">something that you're afraid of the larger
it becomes and the faster is chases you. So</p>
<p t="839660" d="5889">avoidance of–avoidance is generally a very
bad strategy. Now it's not always the case</p>
<p t="845549" d="5210">because sometimes you can't do anything
about something, really you can't. Well,</p>
<p t="850759" d="5010">there's not a lot of sense spending a lot
of time planning and struggling against it,</p>
<p t="855769" d="5340">you know. And sometimes people are in generally
genuinely hopeless situations but often not.</p>
<p t="861109" d="4220">So, I really like the existentialists, man.
I think their—well all the people that we're</p>
<p t="865329" d="7190">going to talk about—their thinking is extraordinarily
valuable. You know, it helps situate you in</p>
<p t="872519" d="4040">your own life. It helps clarify the nature
of your relationship to other people in the</p>
<p t="876559" d="4990">world. It helps you lay out what your future
could be if you were the creature that could</p>
<p t="881549" d="1780">be. It's really wonderful.</p>
<p t="883329" d="8711">Phenomenologists: they're a tricky bunch.
The fundamental phenomenologist was Martin</p>
<p t="892040" d="8359">Heidegger, who was also somewhat tangled up
with the Nazis, you know, which was clearly</p>
<p t="900399" d="4040">not a good thing. And, you know, people debate
about whether or not you can separate his</p>
<p t="904439" d="7791">philosophy from what tangled him up from the
Nazis and I think you can. You know, so anyways,</p>
<p t="912230" d="9079">Heidegger wanted to take a fresh look at the
nature of reality. And, so, Heidegger's idea</p>
<p t="921309" d="5120">was we made a fundamental philosophical error
way back when we were Greek—Ancient Greek</p>
<p t="926429" d="6731">roughly speaking—and that we started concentrating
on the wrong elements of—he doesn't really</p>
<p t="933160" d="6279">call it reality; he calls it being. So a phenomenologist
is someone who's concerned with being. And</p>
<p t="939439" d="3480">you might think, “Well what's the difference
between being and reality?” And the answer</p>
<p t="942919" d="5890">to that is it depends on how you define being
and it depends on how you define reality.</p>
<p t="948809" d="7430">So, Heidegger's observation was that, for
modern people roughly speaking, reality was</p>
<p t="956239" d="8220">sort of a deanimated material objective substrata.
It's dead in its essence, roughly speaking,</p>
<p t="964459" d="4070">and the things that are most real are precisely
those things. You could think about that as</p>
<p t="968529" d="5980">objective reality for all intensive purposes.
But what Heidegger tried to point out is it's</p>
<p t="974509" d="5980">a choice in some sense, because your knowledge
is finite, because you're fundamentally</p>
<p t="980489" d="5180">ignorant about most things, you have to decide
that certain things are true and then act</p>
<p t="985669" d="3760">from that point. And, you know, Heidegger's
point was: there's a lot of things that</p>
<p t="989429" d="5830">you can decide about at the very fundamental
level of axiom. And so one of the things you</p>
<p t="995259" d="4730">can decide, for example, is whether or not
the objective world is what's more real</p>
<p t="999989" d="4630">or whether or not your lived experience is
what's more real.</p>
<p t="1004619" d="3671">Now, you might think, “Well what's the
distinction there?” And I would say the</p>
<p t="1008290" d="6430">distinction is probably something like watching
someone in pain on a video and being in pain</p>
<p t="1014720" d="9290">yourself. You know, so pain's a good example
of an element of being because it's obviously—you</p>
<p t="1024010" d="7480">experience it with your own…it's hard
to talk about just because he uses different</p>
<p t="1031490" d="7620">terminology. Pain is an element of your being.
And it's not something—the pain itself</p>
<p t="1039110" d="4370">is not something that you can even conceptualize
in objective terms. Like you can measure it.</p>
<p t="1043480" d="2969">You know, maybe your heart rate goes up when
you're in pain or something like that. Or</p>
<p t="1046449" d="5631">your facial expressions change. You know,
so you can index it but the indexes are not</p>
<p t="1052080" d="5860">the phenomena; that's hence phenomenology,
right? And so phenomenologists have built</p>
<p t="1057940" d="4770">up an entire system of thinking predicated
on the initial axiom that the best way to</p>
<p t="1062710" d="6380">approach life is to assume that being is the
fundamental reality rather than the objective</p>
<p t="1069090" d="2360">as the fundamental level.</p>
<p t="1071450" d="2859">And then you might think, “Well, why do
people bother with that sort of thing?”</p>
<p t="1074309" d="5381">And part of it is: one of the—this is an
existentialist claim—one of the consequences</p>
<p t="1079690" d="5479">of developing the objective theory of existence
was obviously all the amazing technology we</p>
<p t="1085169" d="3630">have around us and, you know, great, thank
God for that. Otherwise we'd be sitting</p>
<p t="1088799" d="5730">outside freezing. But one of the consequences
of that is once people established objective</p>
<p t="1094529" d="5471">reality and then defined it as ultimately
real, terrible questions of the meaning of</p>
<p t="1100000" d="5259">life arose. You know, if the world—the universe—is
made out of nothing but dead matter, it's</p>
<p t="1105259" d="4941">eternally existing, we're nothing but a
candle flash in the wind, the idea creeps</p>
<p t="1110200" d="5270">into your mind that perhaps all the damn suffering
isn't worth it. Or to put it another way,</p>
<p t="1115470" d="6289">you know, does your life really have any real
meaning or is that just an illusion. Well,</p>
<p t="1121759" d="4091">Heidegger would say the reason that you have
that problem is because you're approaching</p>
<p t="1125850" d="5459">the entire problem wrong. Clearly, things have
meaning; they just don't if you make the</p>
<p t="1131309" d="6090">hypothesis that what's objective is ultimately
real and everything else is merely a secondary</p>
<p t="1137399" d="7140">consequence of that. So, anyways, it's complicated.
It takes a while to get your head around it.</p>
<p t="1144539" d="4531">The humanists and the existentialists and
to some degree the phenomenologists: they</p>
<p t="1149070" d="5339">all came out of—there was a variety of sources
for their thought and I would say one of them</p>
<p t="1154409" d="5441">is the clash between religion and science
or between value and objective truth. And</p>
<p t="1159850" d="4640">they're trying to rectify the division.
And Piaget himself was trying to do some of</p>
<p t="1164490" d="5289">that as well. So was Jung I guess. And the
other thing is a lot of the existentialist</p>
<p t="1169779" d="5980">and humanist work was post-World War II and
so, you know, after World War II happened</p>
<p t="1175759" d="4061">with its immense catastrophes, of course people
who were thinking about human nature were</p>
<p t="1179820" d="4270">very interested in why such a thing could
happen. And existentialism, at least as a</p>
<p t="1184090" d="6490">psychological school arose in part as a reaction
to the horrors of World War II. It's a very</p>
<p t="1190580" d="5569">serious branch of psychology and it mostly
characterized thinking in the 1950's before</p>
<p t="1196149" d="4530">the hippies came along and, you know, made
everything sweetness and light, so—which</p>
<p t="1200679" d="3161">is more where Rogers and Maslow fit.</p>
<p t="1203840" d="5400">So, we're going to talk about them a fair
bit—the three different categories. It's</p>
<p t="1209240" d="3850">kind of a strange approach in some sense that
this class takes because I talked to you about</p>
<p t="1213090" d="5939">some psychologists in that period but the
other people I talked to you mostly about,</p>
<p t="1219029" d="5770">they're not technically psychologists—depends
on what you mean by psychologist after all.</p>
<p t="1224799" d="5191">I talk a lot about Nietzsche and Dostoevsky
and also a lot about a Russian literary figure,</p>
<p t="1229990" d="6250">Alexander Solzhenitsyn, who wrote a book called
“The Gulag Archipelago” which was one of</p>
<p t="1236240" d="6189">the—there was a few cataclysmic events that
brought the totalitarian system of the Soviet</p>
<p t="1242429" d="6651">Union to a halt. And you can argue about what
they were but one of them for sure was Solzhenitsyn's</p>
<p t="1249080" d="6699">publication of “The Gulag Archipelago”
which is a 2700 word book—2700 page book,</p>
<p t="1255779" d="7081">got to get that right—that describes what
it was like to be there and how many people</p>
<p t="1262860" d="7539">died. And it's a searing book. He won a
Nobel Prize and he deserved it. I mean, Solzhenitsyn:</p>
<p t="1270399" d="5010">a remarkable person. He's like the Dostoevsky
of the twentieth century and that's really</p>
<p t="1275409" d="5551">saying something. And Dostoevsky's another
person I use a lot in that section. And both</p>
<p t="1280960" d="4110">Dostoevsky and Nietzsche regarded themselves
as psychologists fundamentally.</p>
<p t="1285070" d="3849">And, you know, it's funny because when you
think about scientists, you know, you usually</p>
<p t="1288919" d="4470">think about people who are conducting experiments,
right? But, then, one of the things—and you'll</p>
<p t="1293389" d="4461">notice this if you think about it because
a lot of you have taken a fair number of science</p>
<p t="1297850" d="4720">courses of one form or another. And, you know,
a lot of what you're taught when you're</p>
<p t="1302570" d="4819">taught how to do science is how to generate,
you know, how to lay out an experiment properly,</p>
<p t="1307389" d="4120">how to get the methodology right, how to do
the analysis properly, maybe how to structure</p>
<p t="1311509" d="6971">the revealing of your findings in proper scientific
format, you know, and how to test a hypothesis.</p>
<p t="1318480" d="2809">But one of the things that you're never
really told about is, well, how the hell do</p>
<p t="1321289" d="5211">you generate the hypothesis to begin with
because, you know, really that's a least</p>
<p t="1326500" d="5409">half the problem and it's probably a lot
more than half the problem. And, so, part of</p>
<p t="1331909" d="5681">being a scientist is the ability to be a hypothesis
generator, not just a hypothesis tester. Maybe</p>
<p t="1337590" d="7000">you need to be both to be a true scientist
but maybe not. Maybe you can just generate</p>
<p t="1344590" d="5150">extraordinary hypotheses and it's certainly
the case that people like Dostoevsky and Nietzsche</p>
<p t="1349740" d="3450">were unbelievably good hypothesis generators.</p>
<p t="1353190" d="5239">And so, you know, their thinking in many ways
underlies the entire development of thought—the</p>
<p t="1358429" d="3401">sort of thought that you guys are going to
encounter in university anyways—their thinking</p>
<p t="1361830" d="5829">underlies the entire development of the edifice
of I would say both scientific and nonscientific</p>
<p t="1367659" d="5770">thought across the entire twentieth century.
And, so, it's quite entertaining to go down</p>
<p t="1373429" d="4781">there and, you know, wander around the roots
of these sorts of things because you find</p>
<p t="1378210" d="4250">out how things are linked together and why
they're linked together and how they developed</p>
<p t="1382460" d="4770">and what that means. And, also, what it means
for you to have those ideas and why you have</p>
<p t="1387230" d="2390">them and what role they play in your life.</p>
<p t="1389620" d="6659">So, okay, so, after that, that's pretty much—in
some sense, you might think that's where</p>
<p t="1396279" d="8270">the clinical and philosophical part of the
course ends. Now, I'm a clinical psychologist</p>
<p t="1404549" d="4330">and most of the people who were great personality
theorists were clinical psychologists. And</p>
<p t="1408879" d="4471">that explains to some degree why the first
part of the course is philosophical. Because</p>
<p t="1413350" d="3909">the thing about clinical psychologists and
psychiatrists and medical doctors for that</p>
<p t="1417259" d="7300">matter is that they're not exactly scientists;
they're more like engineers. So, what an</p>
<p t="1424559" d="4771">engineer wants to do—an engineer might use
scientific knowledge and, you know, good for</p>
<p t="1429330" d="3839">them; they should. But really what they want
to do is make something change. They want</p>
<p t="1433169" d="6210">to build something, they want to transform
something, they want to act on a beneficial—generally—in</p>
<p t="1439379" d="5870">a beneficial way. Well, the same thing is
the case with the health domains. It's like</p>
<p t="1445249" d="4650">someone comes to you with a psychological
problem. What you want to do is you want to</p>
<p t="1449899" d="6480">make it better and better is not a scientific
category. So, to the degree that you're a—like</p>
<p t="1456379" d="3851">you can say well it's scientific because
worse means abnormal. It's like, that's</p>
<p t="1460230" d="4470">not right. You can make that case but it's
shallow because there's lots of times when</p>
<p t="1464700" d="6449">you don't consider normal healthy. You know,
you consider exceptional healthy, right? Or</p>
<p t="1471149" d="5311">maybe you consider exceptional desirable and
desirable might even be better than healthy,</p>
<p t="1476460" d="500">right?</p>
<p t="1476960" d="4199">So, you can't get out of the value domain
when you're trying to interact with people</p>
<p t="1481159" d="5691">and sort out their lives. Because partly what
you're always asking is: “What's wrong?”</p>
<p t="1486850" d="3939">“What's the matter?” “Why are you
dissatisfied?” “Why are you suffering?”</p>
<p t="1490789" d="4250">“Why aren't you productive?” “Why
do you fight with everyone?” You know, “Why</p>
<p t="1495039" d="5401">can't you sleep at night?” “Why do you
wake up screaming?” You know, “Why can't</p>
<p t="1500440" d="4920">you pursue anything that's to your own benefit?”
“Why do you hurt everyone that you know?”</p>
<p t="1505360" d="4059">You know, those are moral questions. And then
the next problem is: “Okay, well what are</p>
<p t="1509419" d="3171">we going to do about it?” “What do you
want?” “How would you like your life to</p>
<p t="1512590" d="2949">look if it could look the way you wanted it
to?” And then, “How are we going to get</p>
<p t="1515539" d="4590">from where you are to that?” And those are
all—they're engineering questions in a</p>
<p t="1520129" d="4880">sense but above all they're ethical questions
because they deal with how to act. So, you</p>
<p t="1525009" d="5331">know, I don't want to just slide over that.
Because that's generally what happens because</p>
<p t="1530340" d="3969">physicians and clinical psychologists and
say psychiatrists—even though they're</p>
<p t="1534309" d="3791">physicians—they like to think that what
they're doing science and that's not right.</p>
<p t="1538100" d="5189">It's informed by science, but that's not
the same thing. It's particularly true with</p>
<p t="1543289" d="3701">doctors because they're not even trained
to be scientists.</p>
<p t="1546990" d="7220">So, okay so that's that. And then the next
part of the course—the last half—it concentrates</p>
<p t="1554210" d="4990">on two elements of personality theory; more
modern elements I would say although not more</p>
<p t="1559200" d="8469">valuable necessarily because of that. Partly
very neurobiological, because we've made</p>
<p t="1567669" d="9801">a lot of strides in the last 50—100 years
let's say. In understanding the structure</p>
<p t="1577470" d="6510">and the function of the brain. Like the things
we don't know about the brain, man, it's—there</p>
<p t="1583980" d="4769">are lots of things we don't understand about
the brain. We have no idea, for example, what</p>
<p t="1588749" d="5741">its relationship is to conscientiousness except
more or less it seems necessary. You know,</p>
<p t="1594490" d="4649">so even that you can dispute to some degree
because there are great case histories of</p>
<p t="1599139" d="5420">people who were born with hydrocephalus. And
so that means that your skull basically fills</p>
<p t="1604559" d="7011">with water. And the most famous case of that
was a French guy who went for an MRI for God</p>
<p t="1611570" d="3949">only knows what reason—it had nothing to
do with what was eventually discovered—but</p>
<p t="1615519" d="5230">he only had five percent of his cortical tissue.
His whole brain—his whole head was filled</p>
<p t="1620749" d="4691">with cerebrospinal fluid and the brain was
just a little skin around the side that was</p>
<p t="1625440" d="3160">like a little balloon. And as far as they
could tell there was nothing wrong with him.</p>
<p t="1628600" d="3929">It's like, “Hmm, well isn't that interesting?
What the hell's all the rest of that brain</p>
<p t="1632529" d="5341">for?” And then you get the other issue—like
I don't know if you've ever heard of (can't</p>
<p t="1637870" d="6299">remember her name…I think it's Pepper…)
She had a famous parrot—an African grey.</p>
<p t="1644169" d="6010">You can look it up: talking African grey parrot.
And that damn parrot, man, that thing could</p>
<p t="1650179" d="5011">talk like a four-year-old kid. Way better
than any chimpanzee. Full sentences, it seemed</p>
<p t="1655190" d="5579">to know what it was doing. It's like, it's
a parrot, right? Its brain is this big!</p>
<p t="1660769" d="1650">So, how is that even possible?</p>
<p t="1662419" d="5941">So, okay so there's lots of things we don't
know about the brain really. And it's unbelievably</p>
<p t="1668360" d="4970">complicated. So, but we have learned a lot
of things that are interesting. We kind of</p>
<p t="1673330" d="5929">understand the existence and the location
of the fundamental reward and pain and anxiety</p>
<p t="1679259" d="4351">circuits. That's a big deal. Those are like
discovering major continents, you know? We</p>
<p t="1683610" d="4840">understand to some degree how people learn
and under what conditions they learn and we</p>
<p t="1688450" d="7260">understand, I would say to some degree, what
the fundamental motivations and emotions are.</p>
<p t="1695710" d="4459">Now those are not scientific categories: motivations
and emotions. They're linguistic categories</p>
<p t="1700169" d="5431">but we're stuck with them. So, but we know
a fair bit about their underlying neurobiological</p>
<p t="1705600" d="4919">basis and I want to take you through that
in some detail because for a bunch of reasons.</p>
<p t="1710519" d="6230">Partly, because it's provides a nice scientific
underpinning to a lot of the hypotheses and</p>
<p t="1716749" d="4780">presuppositions of the psychoanalysts, you
know? So, for example, Freud hypothesized</p>
<p t="1721529" d="5400">the existence of the id. Now there is no id
in your brain but it doesn't really matter</p>
<p t="1726929" d="4580">because the id—the idea of the id—is a
functional category; it's like a tool. But</p>
<p t="1731509" d="4711">there are lots of id-like structures in your
brain. You know and one of them in particular</p>
<p t="1736220" d="4049">is the hypothalamus and that thing—like
human beings like to think that their really</p>
<p t="1740269" d="5061">impressive cortical cap is the thing that's,
you know, in charge of things. But your hypothalamus,</p>
<p t="1745330" d="4000">which is this little tiny thing that sits
at the top of your spinal chord, man, that's</p>
<p t="1749330" d="6559">what running you. You know, as long as you're
not hungry or not angry or not chasing after</p>
<p t="1755889" d="5500">sexual excitement and not gambling and not
addicted; so, as long as you're completely</p>
<p t="1761389" d="6500">well fed and warm and comfortable, then you
can think and you're more or less in control.</p>
<p t="1767889" d="4670">But as soon as any of those things go astray
it's subcortical all the way.</p>
<p t="1772559" d="4801">You know, and you can see this, for example,
in conditions like anorexia. You know, because</p>
<p t="1777360" d="3730">anorexia—you could think of anorexia as
a war between the cortex and they hypothalamus.</p>
<p t="1781090" d="6480">And I'll tell you man, the only time the
cortex wins is when the anorexic dies, because</p>
<p t="1787570" d="3400">other than that it's the hypothalamus that
wins all the time, which is why anorexics</p>
<p t="1790970" d="4809">cannot stop themselves from binging. So, you
know, so they'll cut their body weight down</p>
<p t="1795779" d="5000">to say seventy five percent of what it should
be and that's hard. Like you really—it's</p>
<p t="1800779" d="5461">not easy to starve yourself like that. But
they'll still binge like mad and, you know,</p>
<p t="1806240" d="3720">eat a whole gallon of ice cream and two bags
of bread. And they can't stop themselves</p>
<p t="1809960" d="3219">and that's because your hypothalamus, it
would rather you didn't starve to death.</p>
<p t="1813179" d="4681">And if you're not paying attention, if you're
not on top of the game or maybe if you've</p>
<p t="1817860" d="5370">been hurt recently and so your resources or
your—what would you say?—the negative</p>
<p t="1823230" d="4710">emotion has been interfering with your cognitive
capacity, the hypothalamus will come up and</p>
<p t="1827940" d="4089">grab you and say, “Man, you're hungry
and it's off to the fridge with you.”</p>
<p t="1832029" d="3900">You know, so two in the morning you're going
to be eating everything in there in a kind</p>
<p t="1835929" d="2480">of a daze. And you'll snap out of that and
think, “Wow, what the hell was that?”</p>
<p t="1838409" d="5411">It was like well, that's the id, folks,
and it's no trivial thing. And it's a</p>
<p t="1843820" d="4609">good thing too because if it didn't tell
you what to do all the time—like think about</p>
<p t="1848429" d="4700">how foolish you are. If you had to breathe
voluntarily how many days do you think you'd</p>
<p t="1853129" d="4140">go through? Eh, it's like you'd wake up
one day and an hour later you'd forget to</p>
<p t="1857269" d="7130">breathe and then you'd be dead. So, like
your brain doesn't let you do anything important;</p>
<p t="1864399" d="3551">it takes care of all that in the background,
you know, because you're just not that smart.</p>
<p t="1867950" d="4319">I mean, you don't know how to digest things,
for example. You actually don't know how</p>
<p t="1872269" d="6201">you walk even though you can do it. So, there
are fundamental subsystems, some of them aren't</p>
<p t="1878470" d="3689">even conscious, weirdly enough, even though
they're neurological: they're doing all</p>
<p t="1882159" d="4330">the heavy lifting. And like your cortex is
along there—it's along for the ride in</p>
<p t="1886489" d="4750">some sense. And it sort of thinks its in control
but yeah, no. Not really.</p>
<p t="1891239" d="4481">Okay, so we're going to talk a fair bit
about fundamental brain structures and the</p>
<p t="1895720" d="4419">function of those structures because I like
functional neuroanatomy. I like—I don't</p>
<p t="1900139" d="3260">want to know just what the brain is made out
of but I want know what all the parts are</p>
<p t="1903399" d="5961">doing. And so, there's difficult papers
in there; Swanson, that's a hard paper,</p>
<p t="1909360" d="7100">and the paper by Gray. Those are papers that
were written by I think genius-level neuropsychologists</p>
<p t="1916460" d="4209">and, you know, they put their whole life's
work into a paper and so, you know, you're</p>
<p t="1920669" d="2931">going to pick it up and you're going to
think, “Wow, this is hard.” It's like,</p>
<p t="1923600" d="4929">“Yeah! Some genius spent thirty years writing
it. It's going to be hard.” But they're</p>
<p t="1928529" d="5280">so informative; they're worth the struggle
if that's the sort of thing that you want</p>
<p t="1933809" d="1291">to struggle with.</p>
<p t="1935100" d="5139">So, that's the biological end and then there's
the psychometric end. And psychometrics—very</p>
<p t="1940239" d="3880">unpopular field of psychology, even among
psychologists, and the reason for that is</p>
<p t="1944119" d="6150">that psychometricians, I guess, have actually
discovered things and people hate what they've</p>
<p t="1950269" d="4730">discovered. So, and no wonder. So, for example,
it was people who do psychometrics, engineers</p>
<p t="1954999" d="6540">actually who entered psychology, who discovered
intelligence. Technical psychometric intelligence.</p>
<p t="1961539" d="4740">IQ. And people will tell you there's lots
of kinds of intelligence. It's like, “No</p>
<p t="1966279" d="7161">there aren't. That's wrong.” And it's
wrong in this way: the statistics that psychologists</p>
<p t="1973440" d="4770">use were invented by the people who discovered
IQ. And that means that every single thing</p>
<p t="1978210" d="5380">that a psychologist has ever claimed that's
been verified in some way using some statistical</p>
<p t="1983590" d="5699">process has been verified the same way that
IQ was verified. And so you don't get to</p>
<p t="1989289" d="3931">say, “Well the IQ stuff's invalid,”
without saying all of psychology—and a lot</p>
<p t="1993220" d="3939">of other fields—is invalid too because it's
the same methods of proof. And it's even</p>
<p t="1997159" d="5181">worse than that because like the relationship
between IQ and life success is way stronger</p>
<p t="2002340" d="5380">than the relationship between almost any other
psychological phenomena and almost anything</p>
<p t="2007720" d="6829">else. So, for example, for you guys, even
though, you know, you're all far above average</p>
<p t="2014549" d="3911">in intelligence—because otherwise you wouldn't
be here—like at least eighty-fifth percentile.</p>
<p t="2018460" d="2789">And that's something to think about because
a lot of that is determined by biological</p>
<p t="2021249" d="2900">factors so, you know, so a huge chunk of the
reason that you're here is because, you</p>
<p t="2024149" d="5520">know, you won part of the genetic lottery.
So like hooray for you. And no one screwed</p>
<p t="2029669" d="5340">it up too badly as you were growing up. You
know, but even among you guys, the correlation</p>
<p t="2035009" d="5030">between your intelligence and your grade point
average is quite high even though it's a</p>
<p t="2040039" d="3691">truncated sample, right, because you're
all pretty bright. And even though there's</p>
<p t="2043730" d="5480">a lot of error in the grade measurement system
because it doesn't only index intelligence,</p>
<p t="2049210" d="7099">it's still very powerful. And, so, if you
controlled for conscientiousness and other</p>
<p t="2056309" d="5850">elements of personality, which you can do
statistically, in twenty years the ten percent</p>
<p t="2062159" d="3531">of the people in this room who have the highest
IQs will have the highest income virtually</p>
<p t="2065690" d="4580">certainly. You know, unless some terrible
thing happens to them. You can overcome it</p>
<p t="2070270" d="4149">to some degree if you're really hard working.
And that's conscientiousness, you know,</p>
<p t="2074419" d="4091">but that's also a trait which seems to have
quite a heavy biological loading.</p>
<p t="2078510" d="4629">So, well so that's the sort of thing that
people hate about psychometricians because</p>
<p t="2083139" d="5730">they come up with these facts and they're
facts that are really dismal. And I can give</p>
<p t="2088869" d="6940">you an example: so you guys all have an IQ
of over 115 roughly speaking. 100 makes you</p>
<p t="2095809" d="5030">about as smart as the typical high school
graduate. You know, 115—that's kind of</p>
<p t="2100839" d="8510">the low end for managing the rigors of a fairly
high-end university. You know, 115, you're</p>
<p t="2109349" d="4411">still going to have a lot of trouble; you're
going to have to work like mad. So, but okay</p>
<p t="2113760" d="7190">so 115: now, that's one standard deviation
above the mean. One standard deviation below</p>
<p t="2120950" d="3760">the mean is an IQ of 85. Now there's just
as many people out there in the world who</p>
<p t="2124710" d="7320">have an IQ of 85 as there are people who are
able to go to college. Okay, so then you think,</p>
<p t="2132030" d="6839">“What can you do if you have an IQ of 85?”
And, well, here's one answer: so, the US Army</p>
<p t="2138869" d="4351">has been doing psychometric testing for a
hundred and some years for a whole bunch of</p>
<p t="2143220" d="5040">reasons but they've done a lot of the basic
science, you know. And one thing about the</p>
<p t="2148260" d="5150">US Army is they like to have recruits. And
you can understand why because do you really</p>
<p t="2153410" d="3990">want to go off somewhere and get shot? And
the answer to that is generally no. So it's</p>
<p t="2157400" d="4550">not like there are people lining up to get
into the army. Even in peace times it's</p>
<p t="2161950" d="5560">hard to get people. And also, the Americans
have used the US Army as a—you know, imagine</p>
<p t="2167510" d="4950">you have an underclass of people who aren't
doing well, which is the case in every society,</p>
<p t="2172460" d="4320">and you want to boost some of them up, you
know, into something resembling the middle</p>
<p t="2176780" d="4549">class. You can do that fairly effectively
by inducting young men in particular into</p>
<p t="2181329" d="3691">the army because they get some training and,
you know, they get some discipline and maybe</p>
<p t="2185020" d="4049">they can kind of clamber up into the middle
class. And so there's a lot of policy reasons</p>
<p t="2189069" d="6341">A) why the American Army armed forces want
people, and B) you know, just to be in the</p>
<p t="2195410" d="4990">army but also for social reasons—positive
social reasons. So, they're not likely not</p>
<p t="2200400" d="7649">to let you in. The consequence of hundred
years of IQ testing was the establishment</p>
<p t="2208049" d="4721">of a law in the United States: you cannot
induct anyone into the army; you cannot accept</p>
<p t="2212770" d="5950">them into the army if they have an IQ of less
than 82. That's ten percent of the population.</p>
<p t="2218720" d="7310">So you think about that. That means one person
in ten cannot do anything that is of positive</p>
<p t="2226030" d="6319">value in an organization that's rather complex
but not more complex than other organizations</p>
<p t="2232349" d="6270">that's desperate for people. Nothing they
can offer has positive value. It's worse</p>
<p t="2238619" d="4651">to have them in the army than not to have
them there at all. Really, now, you know,</p>
<p t="2243270" d="6299">that's a terrible way of putting it but
it's a horrible statistic. Because it also</p>
<p t="2249569" d="4421">means, you know, if you think about the army
as roughly equivalent to world in some sense</p>
<p t="2253990" d="4589">in terms of it's complexity, it means that
there's ten percent of the population who</p>
<p t="2258579" d="5911">just cannot really exist well in a complex
cognitive society. So, and you might say,</p>
<p t="2264490" d="2950">“Well, you know, something should be done
about that.” It's like, “Good luck”.</p>
<p t="2267440" d="3740">People have been trying to do something about
that for a very long time. Like, there's</p>
<p t="2271180" d="6460">been billions, if not trillions, of dollars
poured into attempts to do cognitive remediation</p>
<p t="2277640" d="2820">in the United States. Well, not to mention
that we actually have an education system</p>
<p t="2280460" d="4490">and the goal is actually to make people smarter.</p>
<p t="2284950" d="5300">So, we're going to talk a lot about psychometrics
and the thing about the psychometricians is</p>
<p t="2290250" d="4680">they're basically brute force statisticians.
In some ways they're atheoretical. You know,</p>
<p t="2294930" d="5159">and they use computer power, roughly speaking,
and advanced statistical techniques to look</p>
<p t="2300089" d="4801">at large data sets and extract out patterns.
And, you know, I was—I hated the Big Five</p>
<p t="2304890" d="3419">when I first came on it. I thought, “Oh
God, this is boring.” It's like, there's</p>
<p t="2308309" d="5331">no theory behind it; it's not prescriptive;
it's not interesting in any literary manner,</p>
<p t="2313640" d="6870">like it doesn't have a good story; it came
out of—it's so dry. But, you know, it</p>
<p t="2320510" d="8809">works and that's how it is. So, we're going
to spend a lot of time on psychometrics and,</p>
<p t="2329319" d="4371">you know, my lab too has done a fair bit of
work over the last ten years elaborating out</p>
<p t="2333690" d="5000">the Big Five Model. So one of the things we'll
talk about is the Big Ten Model and what it</p>
<p t="2338690" d="4679">does, roughly speaking, is break each of the
five into two—we call them aspects. And</p>
<p t="2343369" d="4180">they're pretty interesting. Like they predict
political belief, for example, quite nicely.</p>
<p t="2347549" d="5421">So, conservatives tend to be more orderly,
which is part of conscientiousness and less</p>
<p t="2352970" d="5190">creative, less open. And liberals tend to
be more open and less conscientious. Which</p>
<p t="2358160" d="4220">a cynic would say that's why they're so
into income redistribution: because they actually</p>
<p t="2362380" d="4370">don't work. So, you know, the conservatives
work like mad and the liberals say, “Hey</p>
<p t="2366750" d="3510">hey, how about some of that money?” You
know, and, “The system's unfair.” And</p>
<p t="2370260" d="4150">the conservatives say, “Well no. We worked
hard and we're not giving you any.” Well,</p>
<p t="2374410" d="5510">you know, they both have flaws in their theories.
The liberals, by the way, make very good entrepreneurs.</p>
<p t="2379920" d="7129">Like, no let me rephrase that. Most entrepreneurs
are liberal in their political outlook and</p>
<p t="2387049" d="3671">that's because they're high in openness.
So the way it really seems to work is that</p>
<p t="2390720" d="5800">liberal-minded people start businesses and
conservatives run them. So, they're necessary</p>
<p t="2396520" d="4250">for one other. Yeah, well because the liberals,
being open, they're off to the next idea,</p>
<p t="2400770" d="3569">you know, and they don't want to attempt
to the damn details; they get bored of that.</p>
<p t="2404339" d="3950">They're not particularly orderly, you know.
But once you've established a process and</p>
<p t="2408289" d="3800">it works you need someone to watch to make
sure the process keeps working. Well that's</p>
<p t="2412089" d="3291">not very interesting if you're a creative
person.</p>
<p t="2415380" d="14530">So, okay, so, that's basically that. That's
the course. So, now, what have we got for time</p>
<p t="2429910" d="4070">here? So I think what I'll do now is I'm
going tell you a story and you're going</p>
<p t="2433980" d="5440">to think it has absolutely nothing to do with
what we've been talking about, but that's</p>
<p t="2439420" d="10320">okay. That's okay. So I picked this weird
picture. It's a picture of Jonah—biblical</p>
<p t="2449740" d="9150">character. It's a 2500-year-old story so
that's a pretty old story. And generally</p>
<p t="2458890" d="4540">if a story is 2500 years old it's a lot
older than that. You know, it just happened</p>
<p t="2463430" d="4600">to be written down 2500 years ago, but, you
know, that long ago it wasn't like there</p>
<p t="2468030" d="4410">were novels and books and that you could find
fifty different stories, you know, at your</p>
<p t="2472440" d="4139">fingertips. There were a few stories and everyone
knew them. And God only knows how long they'd</p>
<p t="2476579" d="5391">been around but it was a very very very very
long time. So, this was written down 2500 years</p>
<p t="2481970" d="6339">ago but we don't really have any idea how
old it is. And, in some sense, it's almost</p>
<p t="2488309" d="5770">infinitely old, at least on any human scale.
Now, you see this picture and what you see</p>
<p t="2494079" d="6151">is this thing that—what would you call it?
Well, it's a medieval idea of a whale is</p>
<p t="2500230" d="2780">what it is. You know, and you might think,
“Well, that isn't really what a whale</p>
<p t="2503010" d="5109">looks like,” and that's kind of right
but a medieval whale wasn't the whale that</p>
<p t="2508119" d="7480">we have. Like, whale in medieval times meant
large terrifying underwater thing. You know,</p>
<p t="2515599" d="4010">and, so, maybe that was—maybe a giant squid
was a whale and a whale was a whale and a</p>
<p t="2519609" d="5291">shark was a whale and, you know, the category's
not the same. So, that kind of accounts for</p>
<p t="2524900" d="6679">the—that in pure ignorance is what accounts
for the kind of strange mythologized representation.</p>
<p t="2531579" d="4641">But it's still a representation of something;
it's just a little generalized. Now what</p>
<p t="2536220" d="6639">he's doing is vomiting Jonah up onto dry
land. So, and you think, “That's pretty</p>
<p t="2542859" d="891">damn weird.”</p>
<p t="2543750" d="5589">How many have you seen Pinocchio? That's
a lot, eh? How many of you haven't? Really?</p>
<p t="2549339" d="4161">You haven't seen Pinocchio? What kind of
parents did you have anyways?</p>
<p t="2553500" d="1119">[Students' laughter]</p>
<p t="2554619" d="4970">Okay, well, you remember in Pinocchio that
Pinocchio's father is stuck in a whale,</p>
<p t="2559589" d="4891">eh, and then Pinocchio has to go down there
and rescue him. And one of the things you</p>
<p t="2564480" d="4280">didn't notice when you were watching Pinocchio
is just how daft that is. There you are sitting</p>
<p t="2568760" d="6250">there, you're watching a puppet go down
into the ocean to rescue his father from a</p>
<p t="2575010" d="3260">whale. And you think, “Oh, that makes sense.”</p>
<p t="2578270" d="779">[Students' laughter]</p>
<p t="2579049" d="3961">It's like, well also that's interesting,
right? That's interesting. Why does that</p>
<p t="2583010" d="8210">make sense? Why does that make sense? Because
it doesn't make any sense. But see that's</p>
<p t="2591220" d="5280">a good example of the grip of any archetypal
idea because an archetypal idea is a very</p>
<p t="2596500" d="4500">deep and old idea that makes sense to you
even though if someone points out to you that</p>
<p t="2601000" d="4369">you believe, which you more or less do while
you're watching a movie, you think, “Oh</p>
<p t="2605369" d="3861">yeah, it's really weird that I believe that.”
It's like, you know, and that isn't a</p>
<p t="2609230" d="5109">puppet going down into the ocean to rescue
his father from a whale either, just so you</p>
<p t="2614339" d="3950">know it. It's a drawing of a puppet going
down into the ocean to rescue his father from</p>
<p t="2618289" d="6681">a whale so it's like divorced from reality
in all sorts of ways. But what's so interesting</p>
<p t="2624970" d="4200">is you go into the theatre and watch something
like that and if someone taps you on the shoulder</p>
<p t="2629170" d="3470">and say, “Hey hey, do you know what you're
doing?” You say, “Why don't you shut</p>
<p t="2632640" d="1439">up and let me watch the movie.”</p>
<p t="2634079" d="540">[Students' laughter]</p>
<p t="2634619" d="3581">Right, you don't notice, “Oh yes I'm
very peculiar. I'm a very peculiar thing</p>
<p t="2638200" d="4510">sitting here watching this and not noticing
how strange I am.” You know, and so well,</p>
<p t="2642710" d="7300">that's partly why I'm going to tell you
this story, because it's true even though</p>
<p t="2650010" d="1220">it isn't.</p>
<p t="2651230" d="6639">You know, and that's a funny thing. I had
a very very strange professor at the University</p>
<p t="2657869" d="4101">of Alberta. He died a few years ago. He got
on a bus, I think it was in Winnipeg, and</p>
<p t="2661970" d="5750">he never got off the bus and no one ever say
him again. So, he had been a prison psychologist.</p>
<p t="2667720" d="3879">He worked in the maximum-security prison in
the University of Alberta so who knows, maybe</p>
<p t="2671599" d="5940">he met one of his old clients. You know, it's
possible but it's very strange—very strange</p>
<p t="2677539" d="7351">ending. Anyways, one time we were talking
about fiction, you know, and he said, “Fiction</p>
<p t="2684890" d="4370">is a lie that can tell you the truth.” And
that's a very interesting way of thinking</p>
<p t="2689260" d="6339">about it, you know, because you read fiction
and, you know, it's true. But it's not</p>
<p t="2695599" d="4931">obviously because it's not really about
a thing that actually happened. But it's</p>
<p t="2700530" d="3549">more than that in some ways because if it's
good fiction it's about a whole bunch of</p>
<p t="2704079" d="5951">things that happened sort of like that. Right,
it's a distillation. It's like someone</p>
<p t="2710030" d="5650">tells you a long story and then, you know,
you talk to your partner and they ask you,</p>
<p t="2715680" d="3050">“What was that all about?” And then you
tell them in two sentences what it was about.</p>
<p t="2718730" d="6050">You boil it down to the gist, right? Well
a really good story is the gist of something.</p>
<p t="2724780" d="5150">And some of the really old stories, the really
weird ones like Jonah and the Whale, for example—which</p>
<p t="2729930" d="4950">as I said is told to some degree in the story
of Pinocchio—they're the gist of a lot</p>
<p t="2734880" d="6300">of things and people have been boiling those
damn stories down for a very very very very</p>
<p t="2741180" d="6520">very very long period of time. Thousands of
people over thousands of years and they come</p>
<p t="2747700" d="5030">up with these weird stories that people remember.
And then people think, “Well, they're</p>
<p t="2752730" d="2730">real.” It's like, “Yeah they are but
they're not real in the way a scientific</p>
<p t="2755460" d="2190">story is real. It's a different kind of
real.”</p>
<p t="2757650" d="8919">So here's the story of Jonah. And so it's
an old Jewish story. There's probably a</p>
<p t="2766569" d="6861">variant of it in the Quaran, but I don't
know that variant so and maybe there isn't.</p>
<p t="2773430" d="6810">Anyways, Jonah lives in 500 BC and God has
a chat with him one day and he says, “Look</p>
<p t="2780240" d="6410">Jonah, there's this city, Nineveh, and people
there, you know, they're really not on the</p>
<p t="2786650" d="4439">straight and narrow and things are going to
go to hell in a hand basket very rapidly if</p>
<p t="2791089" d="3421">someone doesn't do something about that.
So, I think that you should go to Nineveh and</p>
<p t="2794510" d="3410">you should tell the king and all the people
that are there that, you know, really they're</p>
<p t="2797920" d="4600">just not doing the right thing”. And Jonah,
being a perfectly intelligent person, says,</p>
<p t="2802520" d="5460">“You want me to go to a city and you want
me to go tell the king, like this authoritarian</p>
<p t="2807980" d="3520">guy who has absolute power over everything,
that there's something wrong with what he's</p>
<p t="2811500" d="4430">doing that all his citizens are corrupt? That's
what you want me to do?” And Jonah says,</p>
<p t="2815930" d="5490">“There's no way I'm doing that!” because
as I said he's a smart guy. So he runs off</p>
<p t="2821420" d="5570">and he goes to this town and as he's running
off he rents a boat more or less. And it's</p>
<p t="2826990" d="3040">a big boat and there are fishermen on it.
And they're going to like row him something</p>
<p t="2830030" d="5170">that God can't find him, which is not going
to be an easy thing. And, so, God of course</p>
<p t="2835200" d="4399">can't be fooled by such relatively poor
strategic choices because he's omniscient</p>
<p t="2839599" d="781">and all that.</p>
<p t="2840380" d="3820">And, so, he's out on the water, Jonah, and
there's the fisherman there and then so</p>
<p t="2844200" d="4530">God calls up this big storm. And the fisherman
are shorting out about this because they're</p>
<p t="2848730" d="3270">going to swamp the boat and then they're
all going to die and they're not that happy</p>
<p t="2852000" d="4799">about that. So, what they decide to do is throw
everything overboard so that the boat is lightened.</p>
<p t="2856799" d="3510">But that doesn't help much because the storm
gets worse. And so then they all of them start</p>
<p t="2860309" d="4030">praying. And they all have different gods
so, you know, it's like a little god competition.</p>
<p t="2864339" d="5101">And one fisherman talks to one god and another
fisherman talks to another god and nothing's</p>
<p t="2869440" d="4530">happening. So, Jonah happens to be asleep in
the hold of the ship. Now, he's already told</p>
<p t="2873970" d="4200">them that he's been running from his god
and so they think, “Ha, we better go wake</p>
<p t="2878170" d="3439">up Jonah because maybe he's the guy that's
causing all the trouble.” So, they go down</p>
<p t="2881609" d="4801">there and they wake him up and they ask him
about his god. And he says, “Well my god</p>
<p t="2886410" d="4159">made the heavens and the earth,” and their
gods, they weren't doing anything that magnificent</p>
<p t="2890569" d="2851">so they're pretty freaked out about this.
And so they told Jonah it's like, “What</p>
<p t="2893420" d="4199">the hell are you running away from this guy
for? It's not a good idea.” And Jonah</p>
<p t="2897619" d="3081">says, “Yeah, yeah, I'm sure it's my fault
that this storm has come up so why don't</p>
<p t="2900700" d="4260">you just throw me over.” And they say, “Well
we can't really do that because, you know,</p>
<p t="2904960" d="3869">you shouldn't run away like that, but you're
not a murderer or anything; we can't just</p>
<p t="2908829" d="4421">toss you over.” And so they decide to try
to row to shore but God's not having any</p>
<p t="2913250" d="4500">of that. So, he raises up a big storm and it's
getting worse and worse and finally the fisherman</p>
<p t="2917750" d="4420">say, “Ah, you know, over you go.” And
Jonah's into that because he knows he's</p>
<p t="2922170" d="5780">a bad guy. And, so, a whale swallows him. Now
you think, “Hmm, that's probably not exactly</p>
<p t="2927950" d="3940">right because first, if a whale swallowed
you then you'd be dead.” And it was probably</p>
<p t="2931890" d="4030">a shark anyways. It's not like you're
going to be thriving down there. It's not</p>
<p t="2935920" d="5760">a big cavern like, you know, like the Pinocchio
whale; it's solid and there's no oxygen</p>
<p t="2941680" d="4260">and so you're dead. But that isn't what
happens. Jonah's in the whale and he's</p>
<p t="2945940" d="3980">kind of freaked out by this because now he's
in a whale and there's a storm and God's</p>
<p t="2949920" d="3389">angry at him. So, the first thing he does is
pray and tell God what an idea he his and</p>
<p t="2953309" d="3980">that, you know, he'd like to be forgiven.
And so the whale zips up to shore and vomits</p>
<p t="2957289" d="6651">him onto the beach, which the very very undignified
mode of arriving anywhere.</p>
<p t="2963940" d="1300">[Students' laughter]</p>
<p t="2965240" d="5589">So, that's the Jonah story. And, then, of
course Jonah picks himself up and he thinks,</p>
<p t="2970829" d="3661">“Yeah yeah, you know, that wasn't so good.
It was a little rough. I think maybe I'm</p>
<p t="2974490" d="4069">going off to Nineveh to tell the Ninehvites,
or whoever they were, that they're just</p>
<p t="2978559" d="4131">not living properly because that's a lot
better than making God angry. You know, because</p>
<p t="2982690" d="3710">what with the storms and the fisherman and
the whales and all that.” So, then, he goes</p>
<p t="2986400" d="3730">off to Nineveh and, you know, he tells them
what's going on and it seems to more or</p>
<p t="2990130" d="5510">less work. So, that's a very interesting
story and you think, “Well, how did people</p>
<p t="2995640" d="5959">believe that?” I mean, and one question
might be: well, do you believe that story?</p>
<p t="3001599" d="4520">And then you think, “Well no,” but then
you think, “Well maybe that's more complex</p>
<p t="3006119" d="4170">question than you might think because it turns
out that I believed the Pinocchio story.”</p>
<p t="3010289" d="3481">And you say, “Well, no I didn't really
believe it,” and then I would say, “Well</p>
<p t="3013770" d="5319">it kind of depends on what you mean by believe,
doesn't it?” Because you watched it and</p>
<p t="3019089" d="3581">while you were watching it man you were into
it, you understood it, you didn't want it</p>
<p t="3022670" d="5429">to be interrupted, you followed it. So, it's
like, did you believe it? No, you were like</p>
<p t="3028099" d="4341">a four-year-old skeptic sitting there thinking,
“Well, you know, puppet, whale. No, it doesn't</p>
<p t="3032440" d="4310">add up.” You're not; you're acting out
your belief in it by being engaged in it and</p>
<p t="3036750" d="3890">if someone taps you on the shoulder and wakes
you up thirty years later or twenty years</p>
<p t="3040640" d="4280">later you say, “Oh no, I don't believe
that.” It's like, you know, it's kind</p>
<p t="3044920" d="1439">of remarkable what you'll believe.</p>
<p t="3046359" d="5720">I mean, how many of you are Star Wars like
aficionados? You know you won't admit it,</p>
<p t="3052079" d="381">will you?</p>
<p t="3052460" d="450">[Students' laughter]</p>
<p t="3052910" d="4899">Yeah, but there's lots of you in here.
I know. You know, and so that's all mythology.</p>
<p t="3057809" d="4760">It's all mythology. You know that of course,
the person who What was his name? The guy</p>
<p t="3062569" d="5331">who came up with the Stars Wars idea. Lucas.
Lucas was a student of Joseph Campbell. Joseph</p>
<p t="3067900" d="6570">Campbell was a psychologist/mythologist and
the Star Wars stories are updated mythology</p>
<p t="3074470" d="3839">just like Harry Potter and all the other things
that capture people's imagination. So, you</p>
<p t="3078309" d="6441">bloody well do believe this. And there's
a reason for it too. Now what time is it?</p>
<p t="3084750" d="3980">Ah, we'll stop there. I'll tell you the
reason the next time we meet.</p>
