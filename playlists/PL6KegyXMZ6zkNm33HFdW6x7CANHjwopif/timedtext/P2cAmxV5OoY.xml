<p t="3580" d="3110">Then the memes came and then a day later</p>
<p t="7800" d="2320">kind of took a joyless turn.</p>
<p t="10120" d="1660">Yeah yesterday and today right now</p>
<p t="12120" d="3750">Yeah, well it&#39;s amazing well, so here&#39;s the strange thing hey, so</p>
<p t="16510" d="5059">I kind of played let&#39;s say knight on white horse and</p>
<p t="22760" d="2840">so the Guardian yesterday published a</p>
<p t="27440" d="2040">Astoundingly reprehensible article -</p>
<p t="29480" d="820">About your book?</p>
<p t="30300" d="4960">No, about the Channel 4 interview. No, they&#39;ve done some nice interviews about my book</p>
<p t="35460" d="2880">so they&#39;ve been kind of all over the place with me you know but</p>
<p t="39100" d="2720">the Channel 4 people claim that</p>
<p t="42100" d="3520">Kathy has been targeted with threats, you know?</p>
<p t="46180" d="6440">A torrent of online abuse by internet trolls, it&#39;s like 50,000 trolls. You know that&#39;s a lot of trolls</p>
<p t="52640" d="3180">You might start thinking maybe they&#39;re not all trolls, but in any case</p>
<p t="56980" d="2300">overwhelmed by misogynistic abuse and</p>
<p t="59700" d="7280">threats and that they had called in a security specialist to assess the level of threat and so</p>
<p t="67270" d="5569">It was the beginning of the attempt to twist the story around so that the story became:</p>
<p t="74560" d="1650">Kathy Newman -</p>
<p t="76210" d="7670">poor embattled Channel 4 newscaster was merely trying to do her job even though she might have been a bit provocative</p>
<p t="84460" d="3460">interviewed alt-right hero Dr. Jordan Peterson</p>
<p t="88480" d="4460">in an honest manner to to expose his agenda,</p>
<p t="93480" d="3120">posted the results to YouTube and was immediately</p>
<p t="96840" d="2300">mobbed by his army of</p>
<p t="99760" d="4440">Internet trolls right so she went from - so, my sense is she went from</p>
<p t="106520" d="5620">journalist playing a variety of complicated games to</p>
<p t="115620" d="3680">target of criticism online to</p>
<p t="120540" d="1200">heroine</p>
<p t="121740" d="2480">embattled heroine in the panoply of</p>
<p t="125060" d="4620">martyrs to whom similar things have happened in the past and what&#39;s terrible about it -</p>
<p t="129780" d="3520">So, and I inadvertently I would say</p>
<p t="134400" d="1260">contributed to that because</p>
<p t="135670" d="5989">when the Guardian story came out I read it and the story purported to be about the threats that she had received</p>
<p t="142060" d="6199">but really this story because the story opened with the description of me and the description was let&#39;s call it far from flattery</p>
<p t="148320" d="6620">you know, it was the same old thing:  Dr. Peterson, he&#39;s a provocateur. He has an army of trolls if anybody ever</p>
<p t="155740" d="3800">dares to challenge him, let&#39;s say, I know all they&#39;re doing is honestly</p>
<p t="159600" d="5000">charging the trolls come out and then they have to fear for their lives, and that was that was the story</p>
<p t="164600" d="3940">(that&#39;s the narrative now) the threat that threats were just the</p>
<p t="169400" d="5360">prerequisite for the story, and then yeah like a dozen UK news</p>
<p t="175560" d="5680">media sources that the newspapers in particular have picked us this up some</p>
<p t="182160" d="4140">even more critical of me than that some in a slightly more balanced fashion</p>
<p t="186580" d="5160">but and see when the Guardian story broke I tweeted something</p>
<p t="192420" d="4220">I said look if you&#39;re-- I&#39;ve looked at the tweet too are they?</p>
<p t="197320" d="3979">YouTube comments and most of the more merely criticism, but if you&#39;re threatening her</p>
<p t="201910" d="2000">well, stop, you know, because</p>
<p t="204250" d="3110">we had an exchange of words, which is what we&#39;re supposed to do.</p>
<p t="207390" d="4949">I think this message to your followers was one of the most liked tweet you ever put out. - Yeah,</p>
<p t="212340" d="1720">but here&#39;s the terrible thing about it.</p>
<p t="214060" d="6560">You know, what happened was that the fact that I tweeted that was instantly used as</p>
<p t="220880" d="4260">validation for the claim that there were threats and that was just yeah</p>
<p t="225150" d="3270">That&#39;s what happened and see it&#39;s weird because when I wrote that I thought</p>
<p t="229000" d="2000">Was part of me that thought</p>
<p t="232360" d="4060">that thought that that might happen there was a little warning bell that went off that said look you know</p>
<p t="236800" d="4440">There&#39;s no evidence that these threats are credible, and if you respond by</p>
<p t="243580" d="1980">asking people to back off</p>
<p t="245560" d="6410">You&#39;re also implying that there are people who who should back off that this is real, and I thought no</p>
<p t="251970" d="2000">I&#39;m gonna do it anyways because</p>
<p t="254020" d="1770">She has been targeted</p>
<p t="255790" d="5869">She has been subject to a very large number of very vitriolic comments</p>
<p t="261660" d="4440">And maybe that&#39;s enough and so you know it&#39;s okay to come out say that&#39;s enough</p>
<p t="266410" d="3260">But the thing it wasn&#39;t okay because as soon as I did it</p>
<p t="269920" d="1710">Then the fact that I did it was</p>
<p t="271630" d="5490">Used as proof that all of these claims were valid and now that just floored me like I was very</p>
<p t="278520" d="4820">Distraught, I think is the right word about that this morning because I didn&#39;t I didn&#39;t see that coming</p>
<p t="283570" d="5269">&gt;Then were there threats against her have you seen them &gt;define threat fresh suffice</p>
<p t="288860" d="3020">There&#39;s no threats that were sufficient to get the police involved</p>
