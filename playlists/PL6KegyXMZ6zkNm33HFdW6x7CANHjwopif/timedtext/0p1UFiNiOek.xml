<p t="45760" d="500">Hey.</p>
<p t="47520" d="2240">So, as some of you may know,</p>
<p t="49760" d="3240">I went to give a talk at McMaster University on Friday.</p>
<p t="53380" d="3520">(Chanting) Shame on you! Shame! Shame! Shame on you!</p>
<p t="57820" d="3120">And uh, it was originally supposed to be a panel</p>
<p t="60940" d="2120">with 3 other people and also a moderator</p>
<p t="63140" d="2400">and the panelists and the moderator</p>
<p t="65540" d="3500">either chose to, or were forced to bow out as a consequence</p>
<p t="69040" d="2120">of public pressure being applied to them</p>
<p t="71180" d="4120">for being willing to appear with me on the same stage.</p>
<p t="75300" d="2140">So anyways, I went there and talked</p>
<p t="77440" d="960">and there was a lot of protest.</p>
<p t="78400" d="13060">(Chanting) Transphobic piece of shit!</p>
<p t="91560" d="2560">Um, a lot of disruption and that&#39;s fine</p>
<p t="94120" d="2440">because people can say what they want</p>
<p t="96560" d="1880">and I suppose they can do what they want too,</p>
<p t="98440" d="1700">and I&#39;m not complaining about that.</p>
<p t="100560" d="2300">But when I got home tonight,</p>
<p t="103340" d="5920">I found this other missive from the McMaster University.</p>
<p t="109460" d="2680">This organization called PACBIC,</p>
<p t="112140" d="1360">and I want to read it to you</p>
<p t="113500" d="2620">because it actually does irritate me half to death.</p>
<p t="117540" d="3360">I&#39;ll read it to you and you can make up your own mind.</p>
<p t="225460" d="2000">God, you can hardly read this.</p>
<p t="357380" d="3840">There is nothing new about Dr. Peterson&#39;s position then.</p>
<p t="361220" d="3460">It is a position taken by multitudes of others before him.</p>
<p t="422860" d="3760">We anticipate that Dr. Peterson&#39;s talk will, and should</p>
<p t="426620" d="3160">result in public critical opposition to his ideas,</p>
<p t="429780" d="2200">including public opposition to how he has treated</p>
<p t="431980" d="2120">trans and gender non-conforming people,</p>
<p t="434100" d="2140">which may take the form of public protest.</p>
<p t="437000" d="20000">(Chanting) This is where we draw the line!</p>
<p t="457000" d="3140">In the present climate, proponents of free speech may</p>
<p t="460140" d="3100">try to paint such opposition as just another indicator</p>
<p t="463240" d="3320">that Dr. Peterson&#39;s freedom of speech is in fact under threat.</p>
<p t="491160" d="1520">Statement issued by:</p>
<p t="514560" d="2820">Okay, fine. So here&#39;s the point.</p>
<p t="518200" d="1360">This letter states:</p>
<p t="559160" d="2360">Okay, no problem.</p>
<p t="561540" d="2760">So, this is what I&#39;ll say about that.</p>
<p t="564980" d="1920">To the members of the PACBIC,</p>
<p t="566900" d="3700">President Advisory Committee on Building an Inclusive Community.</p>
<p t="571180" d="3280">If you would like to debate with me about the issue</p>
<p t="574460" d="2980">of gender and sexuality, I&#39;m willing to do that</p>
<p t="577440" d="2180">with as many people as you want to put forward,</p>
<p t="579620" d="3360">at any time you want, at any place of your choosing.</p>
<p t="582980" d="1980">Hopefully sooner rather than later.</p>
<p t="584960" d="2620">And if you&#39;re not willing to do that, and you&#39;re gonna</p>
<p t="587580" d="2380">write cowardly little letters like this and make them</p>
<p t="589960" d="3000">public instead, I might suggest that if you&#39;re unwilling</p>
<p t="592960" d="2360">to defend your ideas in public, that you should just</p>
<p t="595320" d="1200">shut up and go away.</p>
<p t="596520" d="2860">And I might also suggest that you should stop teaching</p>
<p t="599380" d="2540">students the kind of nonsense that you are teaching them.</p>
<p t="601920" d="1940">Anyways, I don&#39;t have much more to say than that,</p>
<p t="603860" d="2240">except, I&#39;ll just repeat it.</p>
<p t="606100" d="4780">I have no problem defending my ideas about gender and sexual difference.</p>
<p t="610880" d="3220">And if you guys think that you know what the hell you&#39;re</p>
<p t="614100" d="2440">talking about then why don&#39;t you come out and face me</p>
<p t="616540" d="2980">instead of sending your student proxies to complain</p>
<p t="619520" d="3340">about me when I come to your university to try to make a case.</p>
<p t="622860" d="3040">I think you&#39;re appallingly cowardly.</p>
<p t="625900" d="1140">And so I&#39;m calling you out.</p>
<p t="627040" d="2540">Come and debate me, whenever you want.</p>
<p t="835340" d="2520">You pig! You wanna get me killed!</p>
<p t="837860" d="1200">When&#39;d ya unload it?</p>
<p t="841307" d="800">Last night.</p>
<p t="843280" d="3900">You see, in this world there&#39;s two kinds of people my friend.</p>
<p t="848440" d="2200">Those with loaded guns,</p>
<p t="850800" d="1200">and those who dig.</p>
<p t="853280" d="860">You dig.</p>
