<p t="320" d="7510">Okay, so today we&#39;re going to talk about openness.</p>
<p t="7830" d="8880">Now, you might say in some sense that openness
is the last discovered of the big five traits,</p>
<p t="16710" d="6800">and it&#39;s also the one that comes up most weakly
in the factor analysis.</p>
<p t="23510" d="8329">When Hans Eysenck formulated his trait representation
which was extraversion, neuroticism, and psychoticism,</p>
<p t="31839" d="10841">he felt that he encapsulated all of the fundamental
variation in human personality and he was</p>
<p t="42680" d="4190">loathe to include intelligence as a personality
trait.</p>
<p t="46870" d="7320">Now, the relationship between psychoticism
and openness is rather complex.</p>
<p t="54190" d="4140">Eysenck basically felt that people could be
extraverted and that would be the positive</p>
<p t="58330" d="4170">dimension, and could be high in negative emotion
and that would be the negative emotion dimension,</p>
<p t="62500" d="5920">and that they could also have a predisposition
to psychosis.</p>
<p t="68420" d="7690">He was thinking about the brain systems that
underlie schizophrenia and that tendency to</p>
<p t="76110" d="7640">dissociate and develop hallucinations, but
also maybe the systems in human beings that</p>
<p t="83750" d="5520">are affected by hallucinogenic drugs, which
seem to affect human beings differently than</p>
<p t="89270" d="2660">they affect other creatures.</p>
<p t="91930" d="7360">Eysenck&#39;s psychoticism eventually was broken
down into low agreeableness and low conscientiousness--it</p>
<p t="99290" d="4220">didn&#39;t predict the predisposition to psychosis
at all.</p>
<p t="103510" d="6999">And later factor analysis found that you could
load out intelligence and creativity as a</p>
<p t="110509" d="2161">personality dimension separately.</p>
<p t="112670" d="6670">Now, it&#39;s a bit tricky because you have IQ
measures and IQ measures are much more direct</p>
<p t="119340" d="2319">measures of intelligence then the personality
measures.</p>
<p t="121659" d="4301">I mean the personality measure is something
like: do you think you&#39;re smart?</p>
<p t="125960" d="6870">You know, I&#39;m being a bit flippant about that
because it&#39;s more sophisticated than that,</p>
<p t="132830" d="4610">but when you talk about someone as a smart
person, you&#39;re generally referring to the</p>
<p t="137440" d="2250">trait that we would describe as openness.</p>
<p t="139690" d="6860">You also are doing that when you refer to
creativity as a predisposition.</p>
<p t="146550" d="5890">And you can measure the smart part a lot better
with IQ, and IQ is also a pretty good predictor</p>
<p t="152440" d="2410">of creativity.</p>
<p t="154850" d="3900">Well, so let&#39;s see how they&#39;re associated.</p>
<p t="158750" d="8090">You remember that you have your big two traits--stability
and plasticity--and stability breaks down</p>
<p t="166840" d="3020">into conscientiousness, emotional stability,
and agreeableness.</p>
<p t="169860" d="5550">And then you can see how each of the aspects
are correlated--how highly they&#39;re correlated.</p>
<p t="175410" d="5000">So industriousness and orderliness at about
.4, volatility and withdrawal in emotional</p>
<p t="180410" d="6620">stability--or neuroticism actually--about
.6, and agreeableness and politeness at about</p>
<p t="187030" d="1640">.4.</p>
<p t="188670" d="7890">And then the next trait is extraversion and
openness--that makes plasticity--and people</p>
<p t="196560" d="4680">who are high in plasticity tend to be good
entrepreneurs, by the way.</p>
<p t="201240" d="8030">And extraversion breaks into assertiveness
and enthusiasm, correlated at about .5, and</p>
<p t="209270" d="4810">then openness and intelligence--the correlation
there is lower--it&#39;s .35.</p>
<p t="214080" d="4560">The average correlation between the big 5
is .2, and the correlation between the big</p>
<p t="218640" d="1280">two is about .2.</p>
<p t="219920" d="7390">And so you have to remember, you might ask
yourself, well is a correlation of .4 twice</p>
<p t="227310" d="2540">as large as a correlation of .2?</p>
<p t="229850" d="4800">And the answer to that is no, because you
have to square them to compare them arithmetically.</p>
<p t="234650" d="9640">So a correlation of .2 gives you .04, 4% squared,
and a correlation of .4 gives you 16% squared,</p>
<p t="244290" d="3430">so there&#39;s actually a difference of a factor
of 4.</p>
<p t="247720" d="6540">And so you need to remember that when you&#39;re
considering effect sizes so that you can understand</p>
<p t="254260" d="1520">exactly what they mean.</p>
<p t="255780" d="5880">Now, if you&#39;re accounting for 16% of the variance
which would be a correlation of .4, then that</p>
<p t="261660" d="2650">leaves 84% left unexplained.</p>
<p t="264310" d="6470">But that&#39;s a bit of an overstatement most
of the time in psychology because our measures</p>
<p t="270780" d="8580">are rather imperfect and so, for example,
if you give someone a personality test and</p>
<p t="279360" d="6190">let&#39;s say that the validity of their self
report is about .6 or .7, which is probably</p>
<p t="285550" d="6430">what it is--maybe it might be a little bit
higher than that--that means that their self-report</p>
<p t="291980" d="4400">is only picking up 50% of the variation in
their personality.</p>
<p t="296380" d="8800">And if an R derived from that measure accounts
for 16% of the variance, in some sense it&#39;s</p>
<p t="305180" d="2040">twice as powerful as it appears to be.</p>
<p t="307220" d="2010">Because the measure is so error-ridden.</p>
<p t="309230" d="4690">And a lot of the things that we measure in
psychology are error-ridden, and what that</p>
<p t="313920" d="4340">means is that the correlations--generally
what it means, although not invariably--is</p>
<p t="318260" d="2360">that the correlations are bigger than they
look.</p>
<p t="320620" d="5280">In any case, the correlations that come up
in personality research are certainly big</p>
<p t="325900" d="6560">enough to be meaningful, and I would say meaningful
in terms of predicting major life outcomes</p>
<p t="332460" d="9130">and predicting important economic outcomes
and that sort of thing.</p>
<p t="341590" d="4590">One of the things you might ask yourself is,
exactly what does intelligence measure?</p>
<p t="346180" d="5450">So we&#39;ll start with intelligence, and that
would be equivalent to intellect roughly speaking.</p>
<p t="351630" d="6680">So intellect in the big 5, the aspect seems
to be associated with interest in ideas.</p>
<p t="358310" d="7490">Whereas the openness proper aspect seems to
be associated with aesthetic sensibility and</p>
<p t="365800" d="1000">creativity.</p>
<p t="366800" d="3360">That&#39;s the best way to think about it, as
far as we&#39;ve been able to figure out.</p>
<p t="370160" d="6920">And the biggest relationship is between intellect
and intelligence, as measured psychometrically.</p>
<p t="377080" d="2900">Now, intelligence is an interesting concept.</p>
<p t="379980" d="2480">It&#39;s very controversial.</p>
<p t="382460" d="7440">In fact, one of the things that continually
happens over and over again in psychology</p>
<p t="389900" d="5650">is that psychologists discover all sorts of
new kinds of intelligence, and the biggest</p>
<p t="395550" d="4280">two proponents of that sort of thing I suppose
were Bob Sternberg, who came up with this</p>
<p t="399830" d="3790">thing he called practical intelligence, and
then Howard Gardner, who came up with the</p>
<p t="403620" d="5310">theory of multiple intelligences, which had
a very large effect on educational psychology</p>
<p t="408930" d="3280">when the theory was first proposed.</p>
<p t="412210" d="5320">And that&#39;s not saying much because, generally
speaking, it&#39;s very difficult to find a discipline</p>
<p t="417530" d="4150">that&#39;s more susceptible to fads than educational
psychology.</p>
<p t="421680" d="5220">As far as I can tell, generally speaking,
each fad is worse than the previous one.</p>
<p t="426900" d="8740">So, Gardner posited that, I think there were
7 or 8 different intelligences: linguistic,</p>
<p t="435640" d="7830">musical, logical, mathematical, spatial, body/kinaesthetic,
intrapersonal, and interpersonal.</p>
<p t="443470" d="4640">And people talk about emotional intelligence
and they talk about practical intelligence.</p>
<p t="448110" d="3400">As far as I&#39;m concerned, all of that&#39;s complete
rubbish.</p>
<p t="451510" d="2200">And there&#39;s technical reasons for that.</p>
<p t="453710" d="3460">I mean, there&#39;s technical and philosophical
reasons for that.</p>
<p t="457170" d="3570">The first thing is, you can&#39;t just mess up
a word.</p>
<p t="460740" d="4170">You know, the whole point of having a word
is so that it defines some things, it describes</p>
<p t="464910" d="2759">some things, and doesn&#39;t describe other things,
right.</p>
<p t="467669" d="5851">And so you can make the word intelligence
account for whatever you want.</p>
<p t="473520" d="5990">And so you can say that the ability to dance
is a form of intelligence.</p>
<p t="479510" d="3120">But the problem with that is you blur out
the word so badly, you can&#39;t tell what it</p>
<p t="482630" d="1400">means anymore.</p>
<p t="484030" d="4690">And so I would also point out: we had perfectly
good words for those major intelligences.</p>
<p t="488720" d="2010">We called them talents.</p>
<p t="490730" d="5250">And so it&#39;s perfectly reasonable to make a
distinction between a talent and intelligence.</p>
<p t="495980" d="3460">Now you might say, well how the hell do you
know the difference?</p>
<p t="499440" d="5340">If things look similar to some degree, then
how do you know if they&#39;re the same or different?</p>
<p t="504780" d="3460">Well that&#39;s exactly what you do when you do
the construct validity process.</p>
<p t="508240" d="5400">So let&#39;s say you rated a number of people
on their dancing ability.</p>
<p t="513640" d="5370">And then you rated a number of people on their
ability to multiply two two-digit numbers</p>
<p t="519010" d="1520">in their head quickly.</p>
<p t="520530" d="6580">Well then, you see technically, if both of
those were intelligences, then the people</p>
<p t="527110" d="5440">who could dance better could multiply two-digit
numbers faster in their head.</p>
<p t="532550" d="9690">They would be slightly positively-- *coughs*
--see that&#39;s what happens when I don&#39;t have</p>
<p t="542240" d="2050">any diet coke.</p>
<p t="544290" d="7280">So anyways, if intelligence was the right
word to subsume both of those, then what you&#39;d</p>
<p t="551570" d="1660">see is there&#39;d be a high correlation.</p>
<p t="553230" d="3770">The people who were good dancers would also
be the ones who could multiply most rapidly--I</p>
<p t="557000" d="7330">mean multiply in their head.</p>
<p t="564330" d="5050">But you&#39;re not going to be able to extract
out a single factor like that.</p>
<p t="569380" d="4090">It&#39;s just not the case that those things associate
like that.</p>
<p t="573470" d="13040">So for something to be one phenomena, the
things that it-- *coughs* -- obviously I&#39;ve</p>
<p t="586510" d="4110">talked too much this semester.</p>
<p t="590620" d="5710">All the things that are subsumed under that
definition have to be correlated.</p>
<p t="596330" d="1220">And highly correlated.</p>
<p t="597550" d="2110">Because otherwise they&#39;re not the same thing.</p>
<p t="599660" d="2890">It&#39;s the definition of the same thing.</p>
<p t="602550" d="8930">Now IQ is a very peculiar construct, a very
unique construct from a psychological perspective.</p>
<p t="611480" d="6290">But also, more generally, from a social science
perspective because IQ has the most predictive</p>
<p t="617770" d="5800">validity of anything ever discovered in the
social sciences, period.</p>
<p t="623570" d="7740">Now the other thing that is interesting about
IQ is that a lot of the people who were interested</p>
<p t="631310" d="6380">early in the measure of intelligence were
engineers turned psychologists.</p>
<p t="637690" d="3940">And the engineers have actually had quite
a whopping effect on psychology.</p>
<p t="641630" d="4760">Part of the reason that psychology has an
advanced methodology and advances statistical</p>
<p t="646390" d="4901">techniques is because we got invaded by engineers
in the early part of the 20th century, and</p>
<p t="651291" d="4389">so the engineers made our measurements much
more rigorous than they would have otherwise</p>
<p t="655680" d="2030">been and it&#39;s been a huge advantage.</p>
<p t="657710" d="4020">I mean, one of the things that&#39;s happening
to psychology is that it&#39;s starting to eat</p>
<p t="661730" d="1960">other disciplines.</p>
<p t="663690" d="4310">It&#39;s had a massive effect on economics and
it&#39;s going to have a massive effect on political</p>
<p t="668000" d="1000">science.</p>
<p t="669000" d="2620">And the reason for that is because we know
how to measure things, and it actually turns</p>
<p t="671620" d="2060">out to matter that you know how to measure
things.</p>
<p t="673680" d="6210">Obviously, I mean if you&#39;re going to be talking
about something that&#39;s specific and well-defined,</p>
<p t="679890" d="4780">first of all, if you can&#39;t make it specific
and well-defined, all you can really do is</p>
<p t="684670" d="1790">argue about it.</p>
<p t="686460" d="6730">And there are better and worse arguments,
but the problem is that just because an argument</p>
<p t="693190" d="2950">is good doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s right.</p>
<p t="696140" d="1000">And that&#39;s a big problem.</p>
<p t="697140" d="3530">It&#39;s also something to remember when you&#39;re
arguing about people that you have a relationship</p>
<p t="700670" d="4020">with because if you happen to be better at
structuring your arguments and you&#39;re more</p>
<p t="704690" d="4310">verbally fluent, and perhaps more assertive
and perhaps less agreeable, you&#39;re going to</p>
<p t="709000" d="2250">win the argument.</p>
<p t="711250" d="1910">But that doesn&#39;t mean you&#39;re right.</p>
<p t="713160" d="2340">Unfortunately it&#39;s not that simple.</p>
<p t="715500" d="8870">And so as far as I can tell, the empirical
process is restricting or eliminating the</p>
<p t="724370" d="4980">catastrophically detrimental effects of pure
theory.</p>
<p t="729350" d="4690">Well, and our measurement techniques have
been pretty good about that.</p>
<p t="734040" d="2790">Okay so now what happens with IQ here?</p>
<p t="736830" d="6170">I can define IQ for you just so you know what
it is.</p>
<p t="743000" d="4029">Imagine that you had a library of questions.</p>
<p t="747029" d="2191">So here&#39;s some questions.</p>
<p t="749220" d="5200">There&#39;s millions of questions in this data
bank.</p>
<p t="754420" d="1419">What&#39;s 2 times 68?</p>
<p t="755839" d="1331">What&#39;s the capital of Georgia?</p>
<p t="757170" d="2979">What&#39;s the definition of hypertrixanemia?</p>
<p t="760149" d="6341">What comes after in this sequence: 2, 4, 8,
16?</p>
<p t="766490" d="3960">Remember these numbers--so I&#39;d tell you the
numbers and you&#39;d have to tell me them back--2,</p>
<p t="770450" d="4250">4, 1, 3, 5, 7, 6, 12, 15, 14, 18, 20, 22.</p>
<p t="774700" d="7930">And then I might ask you, in fact, to remember
them backwards, and that&#39;s a working memory</p>
<p t="782630" d="1000">test.</p>
<p t="783630" d="6269">Okay, so those are all questions that require
abstraction and mental operations: that&#39;s</p>
<p t="789899" d="1611">the key as far as I can tell.</p>
<p t="791510" d="5160">So you might say, exactly what constitutes
an abstraction?</p>
<p t="796670" d="5070">And it looks to me like what an abstraction
is--there&#39;s the capacity to formulate an abstraction</p>
<p t="801740" d="2242">and there&#39;s the capacity to manipulate them.</p>
<p t="803982" d="4748">To formulate an abstraction, I think what
you do is you take a phenomena and you represent</p>
<p t="808730" d="2490">it with something that&#39;s low resolution.</p>
<p t="811220" d="1530">That&#39;s more or less what an abstraction is.</p>
<p t="812750" d="9400">So, for example, if I imagine this classroom
later, my imagined representation is going</p>
<p t="822150" d="6090">to be of much lower resolution than the actual
classroom, but it&#39;s sufficient for certain</p>
<p t="828240" d="1000">purposes.</p>
<p t="829240" d="4060">Just like a thumbnail on a computer is sufficient
for certain purposes.</p>
<p t="833300" d="7990">And then once I simplify the phenomena in
question, then I can also perform certain</p>
<p t="841290" d="8169">operations on it, say, in imagination or semantically,
and the capacity to generate that abstraction</p>
<p t="849459" d="5431">and the ability to manipulate those seems
to be the core element of intelligence.</p>
<p t="854890" d="7069">And I think part of the reason why intelligence,
roughly speaking, is a human dimension--although</p>
<p t="861959" d="6331">obviously you can to some degree rank order
animals in terms of their capacity to learn,</p>
<p t="868290" d="5620">but there&#39;s this whopping differentiation
between human beings and animals in this area</p>
<p t="873910" d="3000">particularly--is because we can use abstractions.</p>
<p t="876910" d="5799">Now, I heard a woman named Temple Grandin
speak once and it was a very interesting talk.</p>
<p t="882709" d="8451">She&#39;s very autistic, but very brilliant, which
is not very common for people who are autistic</p>
<p t="891160" d="3570">because usually it&#39;s associated with a substantial
amount of intellectual impairment.</p>
<p t="894730" d="6549">But she also had an extraordinarily devoted
parent who spent almost all her time trying</p>
<p t="901279" d="3681">to pull her daughter out of her autistic isolation.</p>
<p t="904960" d="6180">Now Grandin has gone on to become a University
of Chicago professor--and she works in the</p>
<p t="911140" d="7139">agricultural area--and she has redesigned
the chutes, the walkways basically, that take</p>
<p t="918279" d="1491">cattle to the slaughter house.</p>
<p t="919770" d="4500">And she&#39;s done that to make them much less
stressful for the animals.</p>
<p t="924270" d="3379">And part of the reason she can do that, as
far as she&#39;s concerned, is because she thinks</p>
<p t="927649" d="1591">like an animal.</p>
<p t="929240" d="5230">And what that means, as far as she can tell,
is that she cannot generate an abstraction--not</p>
<p t="934470" d="1270">easily.</p>
<p t="935740" d="4760">Now she can speak so obviously she learned
to do it to some degree, but she talked more</p>
<p t="940500" d="4380">about deficits in imagination or concretization
of imagination.</p>
<p t="944880" d="4590">So one of the weird things that you see with
autistic kids, not frequently but now and</p>
<p t="949470" d="3160">then--there&#39;s actually a famous example of
this on the web.</p>
<p t="952630" d="3820">There&#39;s a guy, I think he&#39;s from Britain,
and you can take him in a helicopter and fly</p>
<p t="956450" d="5920">him over a city, and then he can stand in
front of a piece of paper, like 12x8, start</p>
<p t="962370" d="4380">anywhere, and draw the entire city.</p>
<p t="966750" d="4589">Now and then you see autistic savants who
are children who can draw perfectly realistically,</p>
<p t="971339" d="4971">and so maybe they&#39;ll draw a horse and they
don&#39;t even start the horse like a kid would--like</p>
<p t="976310" d="3991">a normal kid would sketch the outline of the
horse and put some eyes in.</p>
<p t="980301" d="6259">They put some eyes in and make the horse perfectly
detailed.</p>
<p t="986560" d="8200">And what Grandin claimed was that-- she said
okay, you think of &quot;house&quot; or think of &quot;church&quot;.</p>
<p t="994760" d="2370">And she says, what comes to mind if you think
of church?</p>
<p t="997130" d="4100">And maybe she&#39;d say, well you get this little
image of something that&#39;s sort of shaped like</p>
<p t="1001230" d="5080">this with a steeped on top or a cross or something
like that, and that&#39;s a church.</p>
<p t="1006310" d="3230">And so maybe you think of house and it&#39;s like
a little kid&#39;s house.</p>
<p t="1009540" d="4470">It&#39;s got a rectangle and a parallelogram--that&#39;s
not a parallelogram, whatever the hell you</p>
<p t="1014010" d="4610">call that thing on the top--and then it&#39;s
got a chimney with smoke coming out of it,</p>
<p t="1018620" d="1000">right.</p>
<p t="1019620" d="1000">Two windows and a door.</p>
<p t="1020620" d="1000">House.</p>
<p t="1021620" d="1520">Yeah, but there are no houses like that.</p>
<p t="1023140" d="3999">Each individual house looks a lot different
than that.</p>
<p t="1027139" d="3740">And so in order to have that conception of
house, essentially what you have to do is</p>
<p t="1030879" d="5300">you have to take that class of all possible
houses and extract out the features that are</p>
<p t="1036179" d="1900">common across all of them.</p>
<p t="1038079" d="2250">And that&#39;s an abstraction.</p>
<p t="1040329" d="4370">And so, as far as Grandin&#39;s concerned, she
doesn&#39;t have abstractions like that.</p>
<p t="1044699" d="3771">When you ask her to think of &quot;church&quot;, she
remembers &quot;a church&quot;.</p>
<p t="1048470" d="3480">It&#39;s always singular instances.</p>
<p t="1051950" d="6789">Now the thing about human beings is that we
perceive singular instances to some degree,</p>
<p t="1058739" d="4481">although I think our abstraction capacity
often interferes with our ability to do that.</p>
<p t="1063220" d="2639">But we also perceive abstractions.</p>
<p t="1065859" d="3251">And you can kind of tell this if you&#39;re ever
trying to learn to draw.</p>
<p t="1069110" d="2169">Like if I say, draw a hand.</p>
<p t="1071279" d="4900">You guys, most of you unless you have artistic
training, you&#39;re going to draw what&#39;s essentially</p>
<p t="1076179" d="1661">a hieroglyphic hand.</p>
<p t="1077840" d="4649">I think the drawings that children come up
with aren&#39;t drawings; I think they&#39;re hieroglyphs.</p>
<p t="1082489" d="3880">They&#39;re abstracted representations that are
quasi-linguistic.</p>
<p t="1086369" d="3231">They&#39;re not artwork, they&#39;re proto-language.</p>
<p t="1089600" d="3740">And hieroglyphs of course were one of the
earliest forms of written language.</p>
<p t="1093340" d="4219">It makes sense, because if you want to communicate
about something, why not draw an image.</p>
<p t="1097559" d="2271">And eventually the image turns into a word.</p>
<p t="1099830" d="5050">But I actually think that&#39;s the developmental
progression of language among human beings.</p>
<p t="1104880" d="3609">It&#39;s the abstracted image first and then it&#39;s
the word.</p>
<p t="1108489" d="6300">Anyways, if you drew a hand, you&#39;d likely
draw a hieroglyphic hand: 5 fingers or maybe</p>
<p t="1114789" d="3120">even 4, right, because that&#39;s what animators
do.</p>
<p t="1117909" d="3400">You can&#39;t fit all those sausages on one circle.</p>
<p t="1121309" d="2740">So they just simplify it down to 4 and no
one even cares.</p>
<p t="1124049" d="6250">You watch an animated program, which is highly
abstracted--I mean Homer Simpson looks nothing</p>
<p t="1130299" d="1510">like an actual person.</p>
<p t="1131809" d="5271">Like really tremendously unlike an actual
person, and it&#39;s completely irrelevant.</p>
<p t="1137080" d="2950">After two or three seconds it doesn&#39;t matter
at all.</p>
<p t="1140030" d="5349">Which is also why I think 3D movies--it&#39;s
never a technology that&#39;s ever caught on.</p>
<p t="1145379" d="2481">Because after the first 4 seconds, who the
hell cares.</p>
<p t="1147860" d="4780">It&#39;s irrelevant whether you see in three dimensions
because you don&#39;t need much information to</p>
<p t="1152640" d="2220">actually structure your perception.</p>
<p t="1154860" d="3990">Now if you want to see your hand--weirdly
enough--so that you can draw it, you have</p>
<p t="1158850" d="2529">to snap out of your normal mode of perception.</p>
<p t="1161379" d="4191">I find often it&#39;s a lot easier to do that
with one eye closed because it flattens it</p>
<p t="1165570" d="1000">out.</p>
<p t="1166570" d="3109">And then you have to stop looking at your
hand as if it&#39;s a hand.</p>
<p t="1169679" d="1730">You have to look at it again like it&#39;s an
object.</p>
<p t="1171409" d="3691">And as soon as you do that it&#39;s actually rather
shocking because it&#39;s such a strange looking</p>
<p t="1175100" d="1000">thing.</p>
<p t="1176100" d="4539">If you put your hand in a non-canonical position
*gestures* --that&#39;s a canonical position,</p>
<p t="1180639" d="5001">I would say--if you put your hand in a non-canonical
position and then look at it, it&#39;s the weirdest</p>
<p t="1185640" d="1000">shaped thing.</p>
<p t="1186640" d="1969">It&#39;s quite shocking to see it, you know.</p>
<p t="1188609" d="3440">And then you can draw it--once you can actually
see it like that--but before that, you&#39;re</p>
<p t="1192049" d="3230">pretty much stuck in &quot;hand&quot;.</p>
<p t="1195279" d="6681">So anyways, I think what happens with intelligence
is that people are capable of abstracting</p>
<p t="1201960" d="1899">and then they can manipulate abstractions.</p>
<p t="1203859" d="5820">And so let&#39;s take another look at what abstractions
might be.</p>
<p t="1209679" d="4230">Now part of the reason that I think abstraction
is so useful is because things are really</p>
<p t="1213909" d="4240">really complicated and it&#39;s going to be a
lot more difficult to manipulate the actual</p>
<p t="1218149" d="4260">thing than to manipulate some representative
abstraction of it.</p>
<p t="1222409" d="5701">So if you could get an abstraction that captures
the gist of the entity--now how we do that</p>
<p t="1228110" d="5049">is not exactly obvious--but if you can, then
you can expend a lot more resources concentrating</p>
<p t="1233159" d="5990">on the relevant parts of the entity and a
lot less time concentrating on the irrelevant</p>
<p t="1239149" d="1000">parts.</p>
<p t="1240149" d="6780">So for example if you ask a child to draw
a house, what colour the house is is irrelevant.</p>
<p t="1246929" d="2440">Now why it&#39;s irrelevant is not exactly obvious.</p>
<p t="1249369" d="3201">I guess it&#39;s because colour can vary across
houses.</p>
<p t="1252570" d="5280">And colour varies across all sorts of other
things, and so colour turns out to be a non-canonical</p>
<p t="1257850" d="3569">element of &quot;house&quot; and so you can just dispense
with it when you&#39;re thinking about a house.</p>
<p t="1261419" d="4181">You&#39;d say, well it doesn&#39;t matter what colour
the house is--it&#39;s still a house.</p>
<p t="1265600" d="4899">So what exactly defines those features that
make something a house rather than something</p>
<p t="1270499" d="2721">else are not that easy to figure out.</p>
<p t="1273220" d="4589">You could say, well, a house has four walls
and a roof.</p>
<p t="1277809" d="4350">And those are the external walls and I guess
you could identify the minimal necessary components,</p>
<p t="1282159" d="3330">but even that&#39;s not so simple.</p>
<p t="1285489" d="4731">And you could say a house is also something
that someone lives in, which allows you to</p>
<p t="1290220" d="5819">put caves as houses because caves obviously
share very little in common with the standard</p>
<p t="1296039" d="1921">house.</p>
<p t="1297960" d="4279">My point is that it&#39;s difficult exactly to
figure out what set of features we do use</p>
<p t="1302239" d="4690">to determine whether something is a member
of a class.</p>
<p t="1306929" d="5521">There&#39;s this guy named Gigerenzer who’s
thought about this a lot, and he thinks that</p>
<p t="1312450" d="2939">they&#39;re a combination of objective and functional,
basically.</p>
<p t="1315389" d="4780">And that enables us to do things like come
up with a category of &quot;things you would take</p>
<p t="1320169" d="3091">from your apartment if it was on fire&quot;.</p>
<p t="1323260" d="4519">Which is a really interesting category because
most of the things that you&#39;re going to take</p>
<p t="1327779" d="4331">bear very little resemblance--it&#39;s hard to
see why they make a category.</p>
<p t="1332110" d="9399">Pets, family members--probably in that order--photo
albums, identification, what else might you</p>
<p t="1341509" d="1000">take?</p>
<p t="1342509" d="1331">Your phone, I suppose.</p>
<p t="1343840" d="4620">What else would you take out of an apartment
during a fire?</p>
<p t="1348460" d="4480">Well you guys would be out on the street stark
naked obviously.</p>
<p t="1352940" d="5219">Well you get the point is that those things
that I just mentioned seem to share very little</p>
<p t="1358159" d="3870">in terms of objective features in common,
but there&#39;s some reason that they still cohere</p>
<p t="1362029" d="1000">as a category.</p>
<p t="1363029" d="2460">Alright, so why do you need to abstract?</p>
<p t="1365489" d="3131">Well, because you can handle the complexity
of the world better.</p>
<p t="1368620" d="4970">Even your perception is a form of abstraction,
you know, because when you look at someone,</p>
<p t="1373590" d="4309">a lot of the abstraction is done for you because
you just can&#39;t perceive very well, but when</p>
<p t="1377899" d="4240">you look at someone--first of all, you only
see the surface of them that&#39;s facing you</p>
<p t="1382139" d="2741">and not the other surface, so that&#39;s a big
limitation.</p>
<p t="1384880" d="5340">You only see them now in this split second,
rather than extended across time.</p>
<p t="1390220" d="8510">You don&#39;t see any of their microstructure
beyond the general pattern of the physiology</p>
<p t="1398730" d="1490">at this level of resolution.</p>
<p t="1400220" d="1049">You don&#39;t see anything beyond that.</p>
<p t="1401269" d="4390">I can&#39;t see your cells or your organs or anything
like that, which is actually a real problem</p>
<p t="1405659" d="1220">often for us.</p>
<p t="1406879" d="2941">And I can&#39;t see the systems that you&#39;re part
of.</p>
<p t="1409820" d="5209">So right off the bat, just to perceive gives
you a low resolution representation, and a</p>
<p t="1415029" d="2301">lot of that is limitations of your processing.</p>
<p t="1417330" d="1939">Your eyes just can&#39;t zoom in that far.</p>
<p t="1419269" d="2760">You don&#39;t have the cortical capacity to improve
your vision.</p>
<p t="1422029" d="3051">Plus, how much do you really want to see at
one time?</p>
<p t="1425080" d="2729">No more than necessary, whatever that means.</p>
<p t="1427809" d="2610">And evolution seems to take care of that problem.</p>
<p t="1430419" d="4860">So your perception abstracts for you right
away, but then I would say maybe you make</p>
<p t="1435279" d="3770">a leap from perception to conception, something
like that.</p>
<p t="1439049" d="4980">And so that would be the leap from the perception
of the actual object to the image of the object,</p>
<p t="1444029" d="3600">and then a leap from the image of the object
to the word.</p>
<p t="1447629" d="5571">So it looks to me that a word is a representation
of an image which is a representation of an</p>
<p t="1453200" d="4969">object or a situation--it&#39;s something like
that.</p>
<p t="1458169" d="2960">And you need those because you have to deal
with a complex world.</p>
<p t="1461129" d="2400">So here&#39;s one way of thinking about it.</p>
<p t="1463529" d="2441">Look at the top left corner of that diagram.</p>
<p t="1465970" d="7189">I call that the thing in itself, and what
it is is an array of dots, roughly speaking,</p>
<p t="1473159" d="5500">and--I think there&#39;s 350 dots there--and you
might say, well--and then if it was a real</p>
<p t="1478659" d="4730">world object you could imagine that would
be in three dimensions, not two, because that&#39;s</p>
<p t="1483389" d="5311">two, and it would be transformed because it
would be also extended across time.</p>
<p t="1488700" d="4250">And it would have microstructures that were
far smaller than that and macrostructures</p>
<p t="1492950" d="7929">that were far bigger, so even that is an abstraction,
but I&#39;m using a fairly complex abstraction</p>
<p t="1500879" d="1890">to represent the thing in itself.</p>
<p t="1502769" d="2801">That&#39;s the thing you cannot perceive, right.</p>
<p t="1505570" d="1169">What something actually is.</p>
<p t="1506739" d="1240">You just get an image.</p>
<p t="1507979" d="3950">And then the next five things are ways you
could look at that.</p>
<p t="1511929" d="1670">So you could say, well, it&#39;s a rectangle.</p>
<p t="1513599" d="3800">You could say it&#39;s four rectangles, and forget
about the dots.</p>
<p t="1517399" d="5890">You could say that it&#39;s--I think that&#39;s 16
lines or, what is it, 32 lines?</p>
<p t="1523289" d="1970">24 lines.</p>
<p t="1525259" d="6110">So if that thing in itself was an orchard
and you were going to walk south to north</p>
<p t="1531369" d="3190">through it, that would be a good representation.</p>
<p t="1534559" d="5200">Those would be corridors, roughly speaking,
and then object four is a combination of object</p>
<p t="1539759" d="1260">one and object two.</p>
<p t="1541019" d="6191">And then object five is, well, all that&#39;s
blurred out are the little groups of six dots.</p>
<p t="1547210" d="3130">And so you might say, well, what is that thing?</p>
<p t="1550340" d="3260">And then the answer is, well it&#39;s any of those
five things.</p>
<p t="1553600" d="3069">And so that&#39;s an interesting way of thinking
about it too because one of the things it</p>
<p t="1556669" d="4801">shows you is that you can disagree about what
something is right at the level of perception.</p>
<p t="1561470" d="3640">And then you might say well which of those
is the best representation?</p>
<p t="1565110" d="5840">And the first answer might be, well, the most
complex one: the one in the left-hand corner.</p>
<p t="1570950" d="4419">But that&#39;s not necessarily the case--it might
depend on what you want the representation</p>
<p t="1575369" d="1000">for.</p>
<p t="1576369" d="4930">Like imagine--it&#39;s weird, it&#39;s weird--because
imagine you have a map, okay.</p>
<p t="1581299" d="4090">And so you think, well I&#39;m going to make the
best map in the world, and so you make a map</p>
<p t="1585389" d="5760">that&#39;s exactly the same size as the territory
that it represents and has all the detail.</p>
<p t="1591149" d="6010">Well that&#39;s not any use at all, that thing,
because you could just use the territory,</p>
<p t="1597159" d="1210">right?</p>
<p t="1598369" d="7310">Just because, as a map gets increasingly detailed,
to some degree, it&#39;s increasingly useless</p>
<p t="1605679" d="1261">as a map.</p>
<p t="1606940" d="4929">And so what you need is this weird combination
between accuracy and simplicity.</p>
<p t="1611869" d="4951">And so you want your map to be no more complicated
than is necessary than to take you from point</p>
<p t="1616820" d="3339">A to point B, that&#39;s it.</p>
<p t="1620159" d="4150">Because otherwise, it wouldn&#39;t be simple to
use and the additional complexity would limit</p>
<p t="1624309" d="4830">the utility of the map.</p>
<p t="1629139" d="3551">So you might say that what we&#39;re trying to
do with our intelligence is to get what we</p>
<p t="1632690" d="4650">need with the least amount of effort possible.</p>
<p t="1637340" d="8769">And there&#39;s a sort of Piagetian idea that&#39;s
lurking behind that, which is: you have limited</p>
<p t="1646109" d="5400">resources, you don&#39;t want to expend more energy
than is necessary, and you want to build representations</p>
<p t="1651509" d="6020">of the world that suffice to keep you going
now and then next week and next month, and</p>
<p t="1657529" d="2421">then along and then in groups.</p>
<p t="1659950" d="5069">And so you build a representation of the world
that has some concordance of the thing in</p>
<p t="1665019" d="4571">itself, but has this functional simplicity
so that you can actually use it in the real</p>
<p t="1669590" d="1000">world.</p>
<p t="1670590" d="3059">Alright, so back to this diagram.</p>
<p t="1673649" d="5210">So I&#39;ve got the object and five representations,
and then there are ways of representing it</p>
<p t="1678859" d="5130">linguistically at the bottom.</p>
<p t="1683989" d="4631">What that is--the words are basically a simplification
of something that&#39;s already simplified.</p>
<p t="1688620" d="9899">So intelligence seems to have something to
do with the process of functional simplification.</p>
<p t="1698519" d="5801">Now, back to the library of questions.</p>
<p t="1704320" d="4599">So you have this database of questions and
so then what is you is pull out a hundred</p>
<p t="1708919" d="1640">questions, randomly.</p>
<p t="1710559" d="5700">Alright, and you want to pick out a hundred
because if you just pick out one--like if</p>
<p t="1716259" d="3630">I asked you what the capital of Georgia was
and I asked you what the capital of Georgia</p>
<p t="1719889" d="5120">was, and you got it wrong and you got it right,
I couldn&#39;t really say with any degree of certainty</p>
<p t="1725009" d="3010">that that means that you have more intelligence.</p>
<p t="1728019" d="5171">Because the probability that I&#39;d get an accurate
measure with one question is quite low, but</p>
<p t="1733190" d="8010">if I used three questions, well then, I would
start to become--my measurement would start</p>
<p t="1741200" d="4260">to become less error-ridden, and if I used
10 it would even be better, and if I used</p>
<p t="1745460" d="1300">20...</p>
<p t="1746760" d="4889">For a personality questionnaire, the rule
of thumb--and this is just a rule of thumb--is</p>
<p t="1751649" d="4910">that, if you don&#39;t have 20 questions in the
questionnaire then you don&#39;t have enough questions</p>
<p t="1756559" d="3771">to really generate a reliable measure.</p>
<p t="1760330" d="7959">So you&#39;ll still see single item measures used
in psychology, but you can add additional</p>
<p t="1768289" d="3990">accuracy by increasing the number of items.</p>
<p t="1772279" d="6440">I designed an IQ test a while back and we
got a pretty good reliability and pretty good</p>
<p t="1778719" d="1491">validity.</p>
<p t="1780210" d="4269">Reliability is, you know, you test the same
set of people twice and the rank order of</p>
<p t="1784479" d="1630">their performance stays the same.</p>
<p t="1786109" d="5120">So if you got 90 on the previous on the previous
test you&#39;d get 90, and if you got 95, because</p>
<p t="1791229" d="4400">you&#39;re more intelligent in this example, if
you got 95 on the last one you&#39;d get 95 on</p>
<p t="1795629" d="1000">this one.</p>
<p t="1796629" d="1180">So that&#39;s reliability.</p>
<p t="1797809" d="5590">We could get a pretty reliable IQ test with
nine items, but it was substantially improved</p>
<p t="1803399" d="1571">with 17.</p>
<p t="1804970" d="5159">And with increments you get a, what would
you call it, diminishing returns.</p>
<p t="1810129" d="1721">So a hundred is plenty.</p>
<p t="1811850" d="6120">Okay, so you pull out a hundred questions
and then you take 100 people and you gave</p>
<p t="1817970" d="4929">them those questions, and then you score them--right
and wrong, that&#39;s all there is--and then you</p>
<p t="1822899" d="1331">sum the scores.</p>
<p t="1824230" d="5829">Okay, so basically, the sum behaves like the
average--let&#39;s say you average the scores</p>
<p t="1830059" d="3730">just to make the argument a little bit more
straightforward.</p>
<p t="1833789" d="8350">You average the scores, and so each of you
gets the average calculated across the times</p>
<p t="1842139" d="5470">that you were right and wrong, so it&#39;s an
approximation of the frequency of how right</p>
<p t="1847609" d="5631">you were, and then we rank order you: 1 to
100.</p>
<p t="1853240" d="1519">That&#39;s IQ.</p>
<p t="1854759" d="2601">That&#39;s all there is to it.</p>
<p t="1857360" d="2789">Now people say IQ doesn&#39;t exist.</p>
<p t="1860149" d="5640">Well, that&#39;s annoying, because all they&#39;re
doing is gerrymandering the definition of</p>
<p t="1865789" d="1620">the word exist.</p>
<p t="1867409" d="5900">You know, because you can do that: if you
ask if A is equivalent to B, the answer is,</p>
<p t="1873309" d="4560">it depends on what you mean by A and what
you mean by B. It&#39;s almost always a foolish</p>
<p t="1877869" d="4951">question because you can take B and A and
bend them and twist them in such a way that</p>
<p t="1882820" d="3059">you can make one thing another thing without
too much problem.</p>
<p t="1885879" d="5780">People usually get around that by only using
a word in a context, right--in a sentence</p>
<p t="1891659" d="4701">or a phrase or a paragraph that defines the
word so that you can&#39;t weasel around like</p>
<p t="1896360" d="1199">that.</p>
<p t="1897559" d="7790">But more specifically in psychology, we have
methods to tell if something is real, and</p>
<p t="1905349" d="8040">if IQ doesn&#39;t pass the test of reality for
a psychological measure, then no other psychological</p>
<p t="1913389" d="5370">measures pass the test because they&#39;re validated
exactly the same way IQ is, and they don&#39;t</p>
<p t="1918759" d="1691">work as well.</p>
<p t="1920450" d="5349">So you can say, well no, that&#39;s not real,
but then you have to throw out--you probably</p>
<p t="1925799" d="5090">have to throw out the social sciences completely
insofar as they&#39;re actually sciences.</p>
<p t="1930889" d="3040">Because the same statistics are used to generate
their findings.</p>
<p t="1933929" d="3550">So you can&#39;t just say, well this really powerful
thing doesn&#39;t exist while a bunch of these</p>
<p t="1937479" d="2490">weak things exist and they&#39;re measured the
same way.</p>
<p t="1939969" d="1960">You don&#39;t get to play that game.</p>
<p t="1941929" d="3540">Okay, so does it exist?</p>
<p t="1945469" d="3460">Well you can measure it reliably, so that&#39;s
definitely something.</p>
<p t="1948929" d="3320">You know, because you might say, well does
your shadow exist?</p>
<p t="1952249" d="5400">Well, generally speaking under normal conditions
you could measure your shadow relatively reliably.</p>
<p t="1957649" d="2110">Does it exist?</p>
<p t="1959759" d="5350">Well, it passes one test of existence.</p>
<p t="1965109" d="6570">You can&#39;t detect it with a number of senses--you
can&#39;t touch it--for example, but whether or</p>
<p t="1971679" d="3960">not something exists is actually a rather
tricky question.</p>
<p t="1975639" d="9840">But 
you can measure it and it&#39;s useful, and that&#39;s</p>
<p t="1985479" d="3010">not a bad definition of &quot;exist&quot;.</p>
<p t="1988489" d="5050">So, what&#39;s it good for?</p>
<p t="1993539" d="5041">Well, it predicts major life outcomes, and
importantly.</p>
<p t="1998580" d="7789">And we can talk about the power of intelligence
momentarily.</p>
<p t="2006369" d="4790">If you were actually going to calculate an
IQ score per se, you would take the rank order</p>
<p t="2011159" d="6120">that I just described and you would correct
if for age, because you can&#39;t really expect</p>
<p t="2017279" d="5461">a 7 year old to know as much as a 15 year
old or a 20 year old, so generally speaking</p>
<p t="2022740" d="4669">if you take a technical IQ test, it will rank
order you but it will only rank order you</p>
<p t="2027409" d="2770">with people the same age as you.</p>
<p t="2030179" d="3411">So that&#39;s just another, you know, it&#39;s an
additional correction, whether or not that</p>
<p t="2033590" d="7490">actually gives you a more accurate estimate
of IQ depends on what you mean by accurate.</p>
<p t="2041080" d="7530">A very bright 7 year old generally doesn&#39;t
know enough to do much useful in the way of</p>
<p t="2048610" d="9420">work, but they can learn extremely quickly,
and so if you compare 7 year olds to people</p>
<p t="2058030" d="4889">of other ages purely in terms of their score
on an IQ test, there&#39;s a high probability</p>
<p t="2062919" d="4011">that you would underestimate their speed of
learning.</p>
<p t="2066930" d="5090">By the same token though, by the time you&#39;re
40 you have a lot of accumulated knowledge,</p>
<p t="2072020" d="8379">and so if you only measured learning speed
then you would overestimate the 7 year old&#39;s</p>
<p t="2080399" d="4481">advantage over the 40 year old.</p>
<p t="2084880" d="9410">IQ is basically a unitary phenomena, but you
can fractionate it into...it&#39;s very very complicated,</p>
<p t="2094290" d="3460">for reasons that I&#39;ll tell you about in a
minute.</p>
<p t="2097750" d="5000">If you had to divide IQ into two, the way
you would divide it would be into crystallized</p>
<p t="2102750" d="1950">and fluid intelligence.</p>
<p t="2104700" d="4970">And fluid intelligence would be, roughly,
the ability to learn.</p>
<p t="2109670" d="5030">And crystallized intelligence would be, roughly,
a measure of how much you&#39;ve learned.</p>
<p t="2114700" d="6881">Now those are separate to some degree, and
here&#39;s why they&#39;re separate: as you age, your</p>
<p t="2121581" d="2919">capacity to learn decreases.</p>
<p t="2124500" d="1660">It&#39;s quite ugly.</p>
<p t="2126160" d="5410">So by the time you&#39;re about 24, you&#39;re starting
to get stupider, from the perspective of being</p>
<p t="2131570" d="1030">able to learn.</p>
<p t="2132600" d="4750">And that&#39;s just pretty much a linear trip
downhill until you depart the world.</p>
<p t="2137350" d="4680">So it&#39;s nasty to see because it&#39;s quite a
steep generation.</p>
<p t="2142030" d="7150">You can stave that off, by the way, with cardiovascular
exercise and weightlifting--so that&#39;s the</p>
<p t="2149180" d="2960">best way to keep your learning capacity intact.</p>
<p t="2152140" d="3760">It&#39;s not to do cognitive exercises, it&#39;s to
do physical exercises.</p>
<p t="2155900" d="6530">And then as you age, the amount you know goes
up and what happens is those two things actually</p>
<p t="2162430" d="2850">tend to average out.</p>
<p t="2165280" d="4850">Now you might say, well if I&#39;m claiming that
IQ is a unitary thing, how can I make the</p>
<p t="2170130" d="5050">claim that you can divide it into two elements
and that those elements are in some sense</p>
<p t="2175180" d="1000">separate.</p>
<p t="2176180" d="6650">And I think the reason is for this: your prefrontal
cortex, roughly speaking--so that&#39;s the part</p>
<p t="2182830" d="5080">of your brain here forward--you can think
about in part, it&#39;s the part that does the</p>
<p t="2187910" d="5590">programming of motor activity--voluntary motor
activity--but it also seems to be...so let&#39;s</p>
<p t="2193500" d="4880">say you&#39;re doing something new and you&#39;re
pretty clunky and awkward at it, and then</p>
<p t="2198380" d="4290">you do it more and more and you get smoother
and smoother and smoother at it, and you automatize</p>
<p t="2202670" d="1000">it.</p>
<p t="2203670" d="4580">What happens is you&#39;re using your prefrontal
cortex and, to some degree, your whole right</p>
<p t="2208250" d="4940">hemisphere as you&#39;re first doing it, and then
as you get better and better at it the ability</p>
<p t="2213190" d="3830">shifts to the left and then goes backwards.</p>
<p t="2217020" d="4640">So what&#39;s happening, to some degree, is your
prefrontal cortex is programming the rest</p>
<p t="2221660" d="1510">of your brain.</p>
<p t="2223170" d="6900">And you can think of fluid intelligence as
a measure of the ability of your brain to</p>
<p t="2230070" d="6680">program itself, and crystallized ability as
a measure of how much programming is there.</p>
<p t="2236750" d="3450">So they&#39;re separate in that manner because
they perform separate functions, but then</p>
<p t="2240200" d="5180">you can also understand that the better your
programmer is, the better your programming</p>
<p t="2245380" d="3280">is going to be so that inflates the correlation.</p>
<p t="2248660" d="6130">And so you can have to separate things functionally--that
are even dissociable in terms of age--but</p>
<p t="2254790" d="5680">because they work so tightly together--it&#39;s
like, how fast can you dig a hole and how</p>
<p t="2260470" d="1860">big is the pile of dirt?</p>
<p t="2262330" d="3780">Well obviously those two things are different
in some important sense, but they&#39;re going</p>
<p t="2266110" d="3410">to be highly correlated because the faster
you can dig a hole, the bigger the pile of</p>
<p t="2269520" d="1000">dirt.</p>
<p t="2270520" d="7120">So anyways, crystallized intelligence is also
often measured as verbal intelligence, but</p>
<p t="2277640" d="5450">the better measure fundamentally is crystallized
intelligence.</p>
<p t="2283090" d="8790">Now, you know how we looked at the personality
hierarchy, right--that was this *gestures</p>
<p t="2291880" d="2150">to slide*.</p>
<p t="2294030" d="7480">And what you see is three strata, roughly
speaking: aspect, trait, superfactor.</p>
<p t="2301510" d="6360">And it looks like--the superfactors, I would
say, the validity of those superfactors is</p>
<p t="2307870" d="2140">not yet clear.</p>
<p t="2310010" d="4520">You can get a lot of useful prediction by
looking at the traits, and there&#39;s more and</p>
<p t="2314530" d="5291">more evidence--there&#39;s about 400 studies now
using the aspects--there&#39;s more and more evidence</p>
<p t="2319821" d="7119">that you can also derive additional useful
predictive validity from differentiating the</p>
<p t="2326940" d="3920">personality down to the aspect level.</p>
<p t="2330860" d="4290">So that&#39;s the highest resolution personality
level we have.</p>
<p t="2335150" d="5150">There are people who claim that there&#39;s something
at the apex which you might call &quot;good personality&quot;,</p>
<p t="2340300" d="2260">but I don&#39;t think so.</p>
<p t="2342560" d="2230">I think it&#39;s--I don&#39;t think so.</p>
<p t="2344790" d="5900">You&#39;d have to read the literature to understand
the dispute--it&#39;s a statistical dispute roughly</p>
<p t="2350690" d="5850">speaking--but we&#39;ve found in our research
that stability and plasticity are only correlated</p>
<p t="2356540" d="1000">at 0.2.</p>
<p t="2357540" d="1230">They&#39;re pretty separate.</p>
<p t="2358770" d="9020">So I&#39;m going to stick with that for now even
though it might be wrong.</p>
<p t="2367790" d="38570">Okay, so </p>
<p t="2406360" d="6410">if you read the cognitive literature and the
neuropsychological literature, you will find</p>
<p t="2412770" d="7490">that neuropsychologists tend to assume that
there are forms of cognitive ability that</p>
<p t="2420260" d="3880">you cannot describe as IQ.</p>
<p t="2424140" d="5810">And they make that claim because they&#39;ll take
a test and they&#39;ll use the test to measure</p>
<p t="2429950" d="4180">something, and then they&#39;ll correlate that
with IQ and the correlation will only be about</p>
<p t="2434130" d="1570">0.2 or 0.3.</p>
<p t="2435700" d="5800">And they&#39;ll say, well that&#39;s not a high enough
correlation to justify saying that those things</p>
<p t="2441500" d="4650">are identical--because the correlation should
be more like 0.8 for them to be identical.</p>
<p t="2446150" d="6040">But the problem is, let&#39;s say I had a measure
if your IQ and your IQ and your IQ and your</p>
<p t="2452190" d="5600">IQ, and then I asked you two questions, and
you and you and you, and I summed your answers,</p>
<p t="2457790" d="2580">whether they correct or incorrect.</p>
<p t="2460370" d="4780">Now what would happen is, there&#39;d be some
correlation between your total score on those</p>
<p t="2465150" d="2930">two questions and your overall IQ.</p>
<p t="2468080" d="2080">Maybe it would be 0.3.</p>
<p t="2470160" d="5630">But that wouldn&#39;t justify me in claiming that
the two question IQ test is different from</p>
<p t="2475790" d="4270">the full scale IQ test--it&#39;s just worse.</p>
<p t="2480060" d="4340">And you&#39;re going to run into this problem
when you read psychological literature and</p>
<p t="2484400" d="4990">if you ever do any research because it&#39;s very
difficult to determine whether you get what&#39;s</p>
<p t="2489390" d="4620">called &quot;discriminant validity&quot; which is, this
thing measures this thing, and this thing</p>
<p t="2494010" d="3160">measures this thing, and they&#39;re actually
different.</p>
<p t="2497170" d="4310">Or whether you just have a lousy measure of
this and a lousy measure of this and so the</p>
<p t="2501480" d="1420">correlation is low.</p>
<p t="2502900" d="8240">Now here&#39;s a neuropsychological test, and
you can make the case that this is measuring</p>
<p t="2511140" d="2800">something different than IQ.</p>
<p t="2513940" d="7880">So imagine that you see an array of 12 pictures--they&#39;re
just drawings, drawings of a telephone and</p>
<p t="2521820" d="2970">a booth and a chair--just common objects.</p>
<p t="2524790" d="1750">So you see 12 of them.</p>
<p t="2526540" d="5030">And then you have to click one, and then when
you do that, they move.</p>
<p t="2531570" d="3630">And then the next time you have to click one
you haven&#39;t already clicked.</p>
<p t="2535200" d="3310">And then they move again and you click, and
then they move again and you click.</p>
<p t="2538510" d="4250">And you see by about the time that you get
to about 8 of them, you&#39;re starting to run</p>
<p t="2542760" d="5440">into trouble because it&#39;s difficult to remember
more than 8 abstractions simultaneously--7</p>
<p t="2548200" d="5910">actually, and some people claim it&#39;s as low
as 4--that&#39;s the capacity of working memory.</p>
<p t="2554110" d="2900">Which is why we kind of like phone numbers
to be 7 digits long.</p>
<p t="2557010" d="6130">A lot of the things we want to just remember
are 7 units long, and if we want to remember</p>
<p t="2563140" d="2330">more than that, we chunk.</p>
<p t="2565470" d="7430">Although if I show you some dots *draws dots*
how many dots?</p>
<p t="2572900" d="1000">3.</p>
<p t="2573900" d="1040">You don&#39;t have to count them.</p>
<p t="2574940" d="8190">You can see 3 dots. *draws more dots* You
can see 4 dots.</p>
<p t="2583130" d="2890">It&#39;s not obvious that you can see 5 dots.</p>
<p t="2586020" d="3240">At that point you start to go &quot;3 and 2&quot;.</p>
<p t="2589260" d="6400">And then if there&#39;s 6 dots, well that&#39;s how
they would be arranged on a dice, right.</p>
<p t="2595660" d="3420">The reason they&#39;d be arranged on a dice that
way is because you can see two sets of three</p>
<p t="2599080" d="1440">and infer 6.</p>
<p t="2600520" d="5930">You know, if they&#39;re sort of randomly dispersed
like that, and I say well how many dots is</p>
<p t="2606450" d="3060">that, well you have to count them.</p>
<p t="2609510" d="4610">And what that shows you is that your working
memory--which is really a function of fluid</p>
<p t="2614120" d="2760">intelligence--is a very very narrow thing.</p>
<p t="2616880" d="1040">And it&#39;s like your vision.</p>
<p t="2617920" d="3980">You know, remember we saw the gorilla video,
right, and you can only pick up the thing</p>
<p t="2621900" d="1530">that you&#39;re attending to.</p>
<p t="2623430" d="5140">Well working memory is like that, it&#39;s this
narrow narrow form of attention and it sort</p>
<p t="2628570" d="5090">of specifies unitary phenomena--I mean that&#39;s
not quite unitary but it&#39;s close enough.</p>
<p t="2633660" d="5380">And I think the reason it does that--it&#39;s
like, why&#39;s your attention so narrow--is because</p>
<p t="2639040" d="4540">often what you&#39;re trying to do as you work
in the world is to make binary choices.</p>
<p t="2643580" d="4210">You know, you don&#39;t want to choose between
20 things, you want to choose between two</p>
<p t="2647790" d="3870">things, because then when you choose between
two things you can actually act.</p>
<p t="2651660" d="3720">If it&#39;s still two things you can&#39;t act, if
it&#39;s one thing you can act.</p>
<p t="2655380" d="4510">So imagine you go into a Chinese restaurant
is a good example, because Chinese restaurants</p>
<p t="2659890" d="4830">virtually always have like 400 items on the
menu. and you might ask yourself, well how</p>
<p t="2664720" d="2890">the hell do you figure out what you want.</p>
<p t="2667610" d="4390">And what you don&#39;t do is go through every
single menu item and contemplate it because</p>
<p t="2672000" d="1640">then you&#39;d be there for a week.</p>
<p t="2673640" d="3240">So what you seem to do is eradicate chunks.</p>
<p t="2676880" d="5740">So you might say, well I&#39;m not in the mood
for anything but fish.</p>
<p t="2682620" d="2260">Okay, bang, three-quarters of the menu disappears.</p>
<p t="2684880" d="2970">You know, and then you might go, well I don&#39;t
want it breaded.</p>
<p t="2687850" d="4400">Whack, and then another half is gone and now
you&#39;re down to maybe 8 choices.</p>
<p t="2692250" d="3492">And, you know, you reduce that to 4 and then
to 2 perhaps.</p>
<p t="2695742" d="1718">Well I&#39;d like this or I&#39;d like that.</p>
<p t="2697460" d="2160">But the waiter doesn&#39;t care about that.</p>
<p t="2699620" d="4180">The waiter wants to know which one you want,
because until it&#39;s reduced to one you don&#39;t</p>
<p t="2703800" d="1460">get to act.</p>
<p t="2705260" d="6730">And so the reduction, the reduced narrow strip
that we use to perceive the world in partly</p>
<p t="2711990" d="2260">is a consequence of processing inadequacy.</p>
<p t="2714250" d="4760">But it&#39;s also partly because we really are
trying to reduce things all the time to 0</p>
<p t="2719010" d="2800">and 1, yes and no.</p>
<p t="2721810" d="4780">Okay, so back to the three stratum theory
of cognitive abilities.</p>
<p t="2726590" d="6660">Now, you&#39;ve got this array of 12 items and
it keeps shifting.</p>
<p t="2733250" d="6390">And what I would do is score you by the number
of duplications--if you pick the same item</p>
<p t="2739640" d="1450">more than once, you lose a point.</p>
<p t="2741090" d="4860">So the maximum points you can get is 12 and,
you know, people usually make 3 or 4 mistakes.</p>
<p t="2745950" d="4800">And so I can take your score on that test--maybe
I&#39;d give it to you 2 or 3 times just to make</p>
<p t="2750750" d="4620">sure I have a reasonably stable indicator--and
then I could correlate it with your full-scale</p>
<p t="2755370" d="1000">fluid IQ.</p>
<p t="2756370" d="3540">And I&#39;d get a correlation of about 0.25 or
0.3.</p>
<p t="2759910" d="4960">Now, if you don&#39;t know anything about psychometrics
you&#39;d say, well that&#39;s obviously measuring</p>
<p t="2764870" d="5230">something different than full scale IQ because
it only correlates at 0.25 or 0.3.</p>
<p t="2770100" d="4020">But what it turns out is, no: it&#39;s more analogous
to the problem that we were just talking about</p>
<p t="2774120" d="4810">where I asked you three questions and tried
to derive your entire IQ from that.</p>
<p t="2778930" d="2280">It&#39;s just a bad measurement.</p>
<p t="2781210" d="5770">Now what happens is if you take the neuropsychological
tests that people have developed, that theoretically</p>
<p t="2786980" d="6860">assess the different parts of the brain, and
you factor analyze them and you extract out</p>
<p t="2793840" d="4220">a single factor, the single factor looks exactly
like fluid intelligence.</p>
<p t="2798060" d="7760">Now, is it exactly the same as fluid intelligence?</p>
<p t="2805820" d="4150">The onus would be on the person who claims
it&#39;s not to demonstrate the difference.</p>
<p t="2809970" d="6390">We did give university students a very extensive
battery of pre-frontal-cortical tests and</p>
<p t="2816360" d="6660">measured their IQ, and then we used the pre-frontal-cortical
test average and the IQ to predict grades.</p>
<p t="2823020" d="5860">And what we did find was the pre-frontal tests
predicted over and above the IQ.</p>
<p t="2828880" d="8390">But we thought maybe, if you took the pre-frontal
average and IQ and you added them to predict</p>
<p t="2837270" d="4020">grades, say--that&#39;s a regression analysis--they
both added in.</p>
<p t="2841290" d="3780">So they predicted different parts of the variation.</p>
<p t="2845070" d="4080">It added additional necessary information.</p>
<p t="2849150" d="5580">However, if you took all the neuropsychological
tests and all the individual IQ tests and</p>
<p t="2854730" d="5130">you put them in one data set and then extracted
out a single factor--so that would be fluid</p>
<p t="2859860" d="3950">intelligence, roughly speaking--that predicted
grades very well.</p>
<p t="2863810" d="2810">And then what was left over didn&#39;t predict
at all.</p>
<p t="2866620" d="6980">So what we concluded was that neuropsychological
tests--pre-frontal-cortical tests--test intelligence,</p>
<p t="2873600" d="6580">and they test a slightly different thing than
fluid intelligence tests do, but that isn&#39;t</p>
<p t="2880180" d="3580">because they&#39;re testing something different,
it&#39;s because fluid intelligence tests the</p>
<p t="2883760" d="6550">way they&#39;re currently constituted--don&#39;t sample
the universe of potential questions as well</p>
<p t="2890310" d="1720">as they should.</p>
<p t="2892030" d="4470">So it wasn&#39;t that we discovered something
different, we discovered a measurement error,</p>
<p t="2896500" d="1000">roughly speaking.</p>
<p t="2897500" d="1430">That only took 5 years by the way.</p>
<p t="2898930" d="1630">It took 5 years to figure that out.</p>
<p t="2900560" d="6380">It was very annoying because when we started
I was trying to predict grades, you know,</p>
<p t="2906940" d="4890">and I didn&#39;t know the IQ literature very well
at that point, because psychologists don&#39;t</p>
<p t="2911830" d="4770">usually teach it very much, because IQ bothers
the hell out of everybody.</p>
<p t="2916600" d="7330">And so, and the neuropsychologists who have
their own field are motivated to make the</p>
<p t="2923930" d="4070">claim that they&#39;ve discovered something new
and I just took that on face value.</p>
<p t="2928000" d="4400">But then we tried to predict--like okay if
I&#39;m going to predict how well you do at your</p>
<p t="2932400" d="5690">job, well I want to get a good cognitive measure
because if it&#39;s a complex job it keeps changing</p>
<p t="2938090" d="3020">and you have to learn to keep up, and if you
can&#39;t do that, you&#39;re not going to do very</p>
<p t="2941110" d="1000">well.</p>
<p t="2942110" d="3600">So that would be bad for you and it would
be bad for everyone around you.</p>
<p t="2945710" d="7710">And so we were trying to pick up additional
information that would enable the accuracy</p>
<p t="2953420" d="5580">of the prediction to be increased, and looked
at the neuropsych literature but, at most,</p>
<p t="2959000" d="1360">it was an ambivalent success.</p>
<p t="2960360" d="2720">(00:49:25)
Okay, so how does that relate to this?</p>
<p t="2963080" d="5420">Well at the bottom tier, where it&#39;s the most
differentiated, you have single tests.</p>
<p t="2968500" d="4370">And they&#39;re only correlated with each other
at about 0.2, maybe 0.3.</p>
<p t="2972870" d="2870">So you might say, well, they&#39;re all measuring
different things--they&#39;re not.</p>
<p t="2975740" d="2560">They&#39;re all measuring the same thing badly.</p>
<p t="2978300" d="1950">And then you might clump them.</p>
<p t="2980250" d="7400">So let&#39;s say I ask you--oh god--maybe I give
you a test that asks you--that tested your</p>
<p t="2987650" d="4040">vocabulary with 6-letter words, and then I
gave you another test that tested your vocabulary</p>
<p t="2991690" d="3560">with 7-letter words, and then another one
that tested your vocabulary with 8-letter</p>
<p t="2995250" d="1000">words.</p>
<p t="2996250" d="1560">And I said, well those are all different tests.</p>
<p t="2997810" d="4880">Well they would correlate quite highly--not
perfectly--but I could clump them together</p>
<p t="3002690" d="2310">and make one sort of super test out of them.</p>
<p t="3005000" d="6080">And then I could take supertest A and supertest
B and supertest C and look at the correlations</p>
<p t="3011080" d="3960">between those, and those would climb to about
0.5 or 0.6.</p>
<p t="3015040" d="3840">And then if I clumped the supertests together,
which would be happening by the time we got</p>
<p t="3018880" d="6430">to stratum 2 there, then the correlation between
the tests would start to rise to about 0.7.</p>
<p t="3025310" d="5431">And then if I collapsed all the supertests
into a single measure, then the correlation</p>
<p t="3030741" d="4619">between any of those stratum 2 tests and G,
because that would be the highest level thing--G</p>
<p t="3035360" d="5350">is general intelligence, that&#39;s roughly speaking
fluid intelligence--the correlation between</p>
<p t="3040710" d="4790">any of the supertests and G would be about
0.8.</p>
<p t="3045500" d="5390">So the point of all this--there&#39;s no way of
discussing this sort of thing without doing</p>
<p t="3050890" d="4070">it statistically and technically because they
are statistical and technical processes.</p>
<p t="3054960" d="6600">So what happens is that, now let&#39;s say now
you have a measure of fluid intelligence.</p>
<p t="3061560" d="2560">Okay, you&#39;ve got this measure.</p>
<p t="3064120" d="5000">And you take one of the stratum 2 sets of
tests and you use both to predict academic</p>
<p t="3069120" d="1380">achievement.</p>
<p t="3070500" d="4160">What happens is that the superfactor, G, kills
the rest of them.</p>
<p t="3074660" d="5290">You&#39;re just not going to be able to find any
of the tests in the bottom strata that are</p>
<p t="3079950" d="4480">going to add to the prediction of what the
general factor can give you.</p>
<p t="3084430" d="3660">Now with personality, that&#39;s just not the
case.</p>
<p t="3088090" d="6240">You can&#39;t pull out a single factor that predicts
how personality is going to influence job</p>
<p t="3094330" d="2170">performance across your life.</p>
<p t="3096500" d="5840">If you add neuroticism--if you take a single
factor and you add neuroticism, neuroticism</p>
<p t="3102340" d="2890">is going to kick the single factor out.</p>
<p t="3105230" d="2660">Conscientiousness is going to kick the single
factor out, and so forth.</p>
<p t="3107890" d="2110">Because there isn&#39;t a single factor.</p>
<p t="3110000" d="4020">It&#39;s not--the tests aren&#39;t highly correlated
enough to say that they&#39;re all measuring the</p>
<p t="3114020" d="1730">same thing to some degree.</p>
<p t="3115750" d="1890">The personality traits really are different.</p>
<p t="3117640" d="5030">You know, you can clump them into plasticity
and stability, but even there you&#39;re maintaining</p>
<p t="3122670" d="1430">a lot of validity.</p>
<p t="3124100" d="6831">So if I took stability and used conscientiousness
to predict job performance, conscientiousness</p>
<p t="3130931" d="2239">would wipe out stability--it&#39;d be a better
measure.</p>
<p t="3133170" d="5380">But you never get that--you virtually never
get that with the lower tests in the IQ strata.</p>
<p t="3138550" d="7820">Okay, now *mumbling*.</p>
<p t="3146370" d="3080">That&#39;s a good representation of how these
things are associated.</p>
<p t="3149450" d="5210">So at the bottom you have the single tests
and then they chunk into, say, sequential</p>
<p t="3154660" d="5291">reasoning, quantitative reasoning, and induction
on the fluid intelligence side, and general</p>
<p t="3159951" d="3519">knowledge and language development on the
crystallized intelligence side--that&#39;s the</p>
<p t="3163470" d="6380">red--and then they&#39;re all subsumed underneath
fluid intelligence, which is the measure that</p>
<p t="3169850" d="1840">you really want to have.</p>
<p t="3171690" d="4220">Okay, so what good is that?</p>
<p t="3175910" d="6780">Well, it basically correlates 0.5 with major
life outcomes.</p>
<p t="3182690" d="4660">And that&#39;s 25% of the variance, and maybe
you can get it a bit higher than that, but</p>
<p t="3187350" d="4780">we&#39;ll just stick with 0.5 as a representation.</p>
<p t="3192130" d="10610">And so, let&#39;s 
say you take a bunch of students, 100 of them,</p>
<p t="3202740" d="6620">and you want to sort them into those who will
pass the class with a 50% failure rate.</p>
<p t="3209360" d="3000">So you just pick them randomly--you&#39;re going
to pass, you&#39;re going to fail, you&#39;re going</p>
<p t="3212360" d="1000">to pass, you&#39;re going to fail.</p>
<p t="3213360" d="1000">So that&#39;s no knowledge.</p>
<p t="3214360" d="1530">I have no predictive knowledge whatsoever.</p>
<p t="3215890" d="6210">So my validity--the validity of my classification
is basically going to be equivalent to chance:</p>
<p t="3222100" d="1000">zero.</p>
<p t="3223100" d="4780">Right, I&#39;m only going to have a 50% chance
of picking who passes and who fails.</p>
<p t="3227880" d="7180">If I used IQs--if I had all your IQ scores--and
I did the prediction, I&#39;d get it right 75%</p>
<p t="3235060" d="1630">of the time.</p>
<p t="3236690" d="1440">So it&#39;s a huge difference.</p>
<p t="3238130" d="3650">It cuts the failure rate in half by using
IQ.</p>
<p t="3241780" d="5710">And IQ is a very good predictor of health,
it&#39;s a predictor of longevity, it&#39;s a predictor</p>
<p t="3247490" d="4050">of resistance to post traumatic stress disorder,
it&#39;s a predictor of--obviously--occupational</p>
<p t="3251540" d="7190">status, it&#39;s a prediction of educational success,
it&#39;s a predictor of income.</p>
<p t="3258730" d="1890">It&#39;s a very powerful predictor.</p>
<p t="3260620" d="5060">And here&#39;s another way of conceptualizing
its effects.</p>
<p t="3265680" d="6280">So imagine you could choose how you were going
to be when you were born--this is in North</p>
<p t="3271960" d="4100">America because it&#39;s going to vary by society,
at least to some degree.</p>
<p t="3276060" d="5490">You get to be born into a family that&#39;s at
the 95th percentile for wealth, or you get</p>
<p t="3281550" d="3880">to be born at the 95th percentile for intelligence.</p>
<p t="3285430" d="3100">Who&#39;s better off at the age of 40?</p>
<p t="3288530" d="5760">And the answer is the person who picks being
born with an IQ in the 95th percentile at</p>
<p t="3294290" d="1000">birth.</p>
<p t="3295290" d="7090">It&#39;s a more powerful predictor of long-term
life outcome than familial wealth.</p>
<p t="3302380" d="1660">And it shows up everywhere.</p>
<p t="3304040" d="3683">One of the things we did recently was look
at disgust sensitivity--we&#39;re going to talk</p>
<p t="3307723" d="4557">a little bit about that when we talk about
conscientiousness because orderly people seem</p>
<p t="3312280" d="3700">to be more sensitive to disgust than disorderly
people.</p>
<p t="3315980" d="2390">That seems to be why they’re orderly.</p>
<p t="3318370" d="5100">But, the higher you are in IQ, the less disgust
sensitive you are.</p>
<p t="3323470" d="2290">Now we don&#39;t know exactly why that is.</p>
<p t="3325760" d="6680">Maybe it&#39;s because, you know, maybe you could
make the inference that IQ is related in some</p>
<p t="3332440" d="6970">way to the physiological integrity of the
cortex rather than the limbic system, which</p>
<p t="3339410" d="4360">is the source of, say, emotions and motivations.</p>
<p t="3343770" d="6520">And the more powerful it is, the more inhibitory
capacity it has over the more fundamental</p>
<p t="3350290" d="1920">motivations and emotions.</p>
<p t="3352210" d="1340">You could make that case.</p>
<p t="3353550" d="6520">The problem is that intelligent people don&#39;t
necessarily seem to be any less impulsive,</p>
<p t="3360070" d="6180">so... and you can have a pretty vicious personality
disorder that&#39;s characterized by extremely</p>
<p t="3366250" d="5420">disorganized behaviour and a complete inability
to put long term plans into operation, and</p>
<p t="3371670" d="1530">still have a high IQ.</p>
<p t="3373200" d="6060">So, one of the things we really can&#39;t figure
out--it&#39;s just a hell of a thing to try to</p>
<p t="3379260" d="1430">figure out.</p>
<p t="3380690" d="3710">Like the relationship between IQ and industriousness
is zero.</p>
<p t="3384400" d="5950">And that just makes no sense to me because
most of the brain models are predicated on</p>
<p t="3390350" d="6190">the idea that your ability to engage in long-term
planning is a factor that&#39;s associated with</p>
<p t="3396540" d="1560">intelligence.</p>
<p t="3398100" d="4430">But then industriousness people seem to not
only engage in long-term planning, they seem</p>
<p t="3402530" d="3880">to do it right so that if they&#39;re more industrious
and they put their plans into operation, then</p>
<p t="3406410" d="1980">the plans seem to actually work.</p>
<p t="3408390" d="2600">But it&#39;s not correlated with IQ.</p>
<p t="3410990" d="5000">So then I can&#39;t figure out, well obviously
the industrious person, in some way, is able</p>
<p t="3415990" d="2170">to regulate their own behaviour.</p>
<p t="3418160" d="2709">You know, well they&#39;re not procrastinating,
for example.</p>
<p t="3420869" d="5750">And you&#39;d think that that--the ability to
not procrastinate--would be a cognitive feature,</p>
<p t="3426619" d="1421">but it doesn&#39;t seem to be.</p>
<p t="3428040" d="3690">And we have no idea what makes people industrious,
and we can&#39;t figure it out.</p>
<p t="3431730" d="4480">So it&#39;s this incredibly potent predictor--it&#39;s
just about as powerful as IQ--and we have</p>
<p t="3436210" d="5590">no idea what it is.</p>
<p t="3441800" d="4620">So if you think you have a smart idea about
that and you want to pursue it, feel free</p>
<p t="3446420" d="2590">because there&#39;s a big mystery there that no
one&#39;s been able to crack.</p>
<p t="3449010" d="4750">And we&#39;ve been at it for a long time and have
had almost no success.</p>
<p t="3453760" d="5950">You know, we had people do things like, we&#39;d
give them sentences of n’s, m&#39;s and u&#39;s--sort</p>
<p t="3459710" d="2710">of randomly distributed--and then we&#39;d have
them count the u&#39;s.</p>
<p t="3462420" d="5270">You know, like a whole page of sentences--they’re
not sentences, they&#39;re just strings of letters.</p>
<p t="3467690" d="1730">Count the u&#39;s--how useless!</p>
<p t="3469420" d="3170">You&#39;d think that someone industrious would
do that better.</p>
<p t="3472590" d="2070">They don&#39;t.</p>
<p t="3474660" d="1500">That&#39;s an IQ test.</p>
<p t="3476160" d="3700">The people who can count the u&#39;s faster have
higher IQs.</p>
<p t="3479860" d="5490">Almost everything that you would do where
it has to do with manipulations of abstractions</p>
<p t="3485350" d="6270">of any sort--even something that basic--seems
to be fundamentally associated with IQ.</p>
<p t="3491620" d="3730">People with higher IQs have slightly bigger
heads, if you control for body size.</p>
<p t="3495350" d="3910">They have slightly bigger brains, if you control
for body size.</p>
<p t="3499260" d="5780">The axons on their neurons are a bit thicker,
so the electrical messages seem to travel</p>
<p t="3505040" d="2630">a little bit more efficiently.</p>
<p t="3507670" d="3120">They are slightly faster in simple reflex
tests.</p>
<p t="3510790" d="4550">So it goes right down to the level of...because
a simple reflex--a light goes on, you push</p>
<p t="3515340" d="3060">a button--there&#39;s not many neurons mediating
that response.</p>
<p t="3518400" d="1440">You know, chains of neurons.</p>
<p t="3519840" d="3050">There&#39;s only a few neurons communicating so
that you can do that.</p>
<p t="3522890" d="5750">But even at that relatively simple processing
level, IQ is associated with speed.</p>
<p t="3528640" d="2310">So there&#39;s a physiological component.</p>
<p t="3530950" d="3630">You&#39;re less likely to develop Alzheimer&#39;s
disease if you have a high IQ.</p>
<p t="3534580" d="2160">And maybe that&#39;s just because your brain is
more robust.</p>
<p t="3536740" d="5310">You know, so you could sustain damage, say,
of up to 50% of your brain and you wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p t="3542050" d="3720">even show it if you have a sufficiently high
IQ.</p>
<p t="3545770" d="4400">Whereas if you&#39;re on the bottom end of the
IQ distribution, you&#39;re much more--you seem</p>
<p t="3550170" d="3600">to be much more susceptible to physiological
damage.</p>
<p t="3553770" d="5270">Nutrition is a big predictor of IQ variation.</p>
<p t="3559040" d="2300">And a lot of that&#39;s been hammered out of modern
societies.</p>
<p t="3561340" d="6640">You know, so 150 years ago people&#39;s IQ was
pretty tightly associated with their nutritional</p>
<p t="3567980" d="4270">status, but now there are very few people
in North America who don&#39;t have enough to</p>
<p t="3572250" d="3100">eat, even though there&#39;s some variation in
quality of diet.</p>
<p t="3575350" d="9100">And that&#39;s flattened out a lot of the cultural
variability in intelligence.</p>
<p t="3584450" d="10390">Okay, so this guy named Hemphill did this
paper--an American psychologist a while back--and</p>
<p t="3594840" d="3800">one of the things he was interested in doing--remember
we talked about effect sizes, right.</p>
<p t="3598640" d="4920">How big is an effect in psychology or in social
sciences in general?</p>
<p t="3603560" d="7070">And people have used rules of thumb that 0.5
was a moderate effect and 0.3 was a minimal</p>
<p t="3610630" d="6300">effect and 0.2 was starting to diminish to
the point of non-utility.</p>
<p t="3616930" d="4550">But what Hemphill did instead of guessing,
because that was just a guess, was actually</p>
<p t="3621480" d="4030">go and look at papers that were published
in psychology to see what effect sizes were</p>
<p t="3625510" d="1490">being reported.</p>
<p t="3627000" d="4390">So it&#39;s empirical analysis of how big the
effects that psychologists and other social</p>
<p t="3631390" d="2700">scientists report.</p>
<p t="3634090" d="8870">And so what he found was that the highest
third of paper or the third of papers that</p>
<p t="3642960" d="7310">had the biggest effects reported effects from
0.35 to 0.78, the middle third from 0.21 to</p>
<p t="3650270" d="4230">0.33, and the lower third from 0.02 to 0.21.</p>
<p t="3654500" d="11190">*mumbling* If you look on the left side here
you see an r of less than 0.15 characterizes</p>
<p t="3665690" d="2840">the first quarter of published studies.</p>
<p t="3668530" d="4730">An r of 0.15 to 0.35, the next quartile.</p>
<p t="3673260" d="6530">So 50% of psychological studies report an
r of less than 0.35.</p>
<p t="3679790" d="9960">90% report an r of less than 0.5, and only
7 to 8% report an r of 0.5 or above.</p>
<p t="3689750" d="5320">So what that means is that the relationship
between IQ and, say, academic performance</p>
<p t="3695070" d="8340">or long-term life income is higher than that
reported in all but about 5% of psychology</p>
<p t="3703410" d="1240">studies.</p>
<p t="3704650" d="8860">Okay so here&#39;s an interesting--you might say,
again, in order to determine that something</p>
<p t="3713510" d="3070">exists, you have to be able to measure it
and then it has to be good for something.</p>
<p t="3716580" d="5810">So it has to be grippable and it has to be
useable as a tool, we&#39;ll say for the sake</p>
<p t="3722390" d="1070">of argument.</p>
<p t="3723460" d="4620">What sort of IQ do you need for what kind
of job?</p>
<p t="3728080" d="5430">This was derived from a company called Wonderlic,
and Wonderlic does employment testing.</p>
<p t="3733510" d="1770">Psychologists usually don&#39;t use the Wonderlic
test.</p>
<p t="3735280" d="3240">It&#39;s a relatively short IQ test, and it&#39;s
a good test.</p>
<p t="3738520" d="3470">I think psychologists don&#39;t use it because
it was developed commercially, but we tested</p>
<p t="3741990" d="3780">the Wonderlic out a lot and it has excellent
psychometric properties.</p>
<p t="3745770" d="2190">It&#39;s a very good IQ test.</p>
<p t="3747960" d="8330">It probably errs a little bit in testing crystallized
IQ rather than fluid IQ, but we won&#39;t argue</p>
<p t="3756290" d="1680">about that for the time being.</p>
<p t="3757970" d="9250">Alright so, if you have an IQ from 116 to
130, that puts you in the 86th to 95th percentile.</p>
<p t="3767220" d="5050">Right, so that means you&#39;re minimally--if
there were 8 people in a room, on average</p>
<p t="3772270" d="3270">you&#39;d be the smartest person.</p>
<p t="3775540" d="7730">I should tell you, just so you know, that
if you&#39;re a state college student--we&#39;ll use</p>
<p t="3783270" d="4780">the US as an example because there&#39;s more
differentiation between the American universities</p>
<p t="3788050" d="7380">in terms of quality than there is the Canadian
universities--if you&#39;re in an average American</p>
<p t="3795430" d="3990">post-secondary institution, your IQ is 115.</p>
<p t="3799420" d="5220">And so, you think, that&#39;s not all that bright.</p>
<p t="3804640" d="6969">But that&#39;s brighter than 7 out of 8 people
in the general population.</p>
<p t="3811609" d="5381">And so the are as many people--if you look
at the North American distribution...so you</p>
<p t="3816990" d="4000">have the 50th percentile in the middle of
the normal distribution, you have the 85th</p>
<p t="3820990" d="3010">percentile here, and you have the 15th percentile
here.</p>
<p t="3824000" d="5460">So about 70% of people fall between the 15th
and the 85th percentile.</p>
<p t="3829460" d="4260">At the 15th percentile you&#39;re not really very
literate.</p>
<p t="3833720" d="4149">And so what that means is that in the United
States there&#39;s just as many people who aren&#39;t</p>
<p t="3837869" d="3601">literate as there are people who are in college.</p>
<p t="3841470" d="6940">And what I would mean by literate is not so
much--like here&#39;s a bare bones definition</p>
<p t="3848410" d="4340">of literate: you can follow written instructions.</p>
<p t="3852750" d="3270">And so what that means is it&#39;s kind of a two-fold
issue, right.</p>
<p t="3856020" d="5470">You can make out the words and the phrases
and the sentences, but then you can translate</p>
<p t="3861490" d="3520">them into actual action--you can use them
as information.</p>
<p t="3865010" d="3430">And at 85 you&#39;re going to have not a very
good time doing that.</p>
<p t="3868440" d="8400">And so, when you&#39;re wondering things about
the way society is structured and why people</p>
<p t="3876840" d="4840">don&#39;t necessarily make the most intellectually
sophisticated choices, one thing that&#39;s very</p>
<p t="3881680" d="4090">much worth remembering is that there&#39;s just
as many people who are functionally illiterate</p>
<p t="3885770" d="5380">in north America as there are people who are
in tier-one colleges.</p>
<p t="3891150" d="1000">It&#39;s quite shocking.</p>
<p t="3892150" d="4860">Anyways, okay so you want to be an attorney,
a research analyst, an editor, an advertising</p>
<p t="3897010" d="5650">manager, a chemist, an engineer, an executive,
a systems analyst, an auditor--so you&#39;re up</p>
<p t="3902660" d="2820">in the professional levels there.</p>
<p t="3905480" d="3620">You need an IQ of at least 116.</p>
<p t="3909100" d="2140">And so 130 would be better.</p>
<p t="3911240" d="5750">My suspicions are that the average IQ of people
in this room is about 120 to 125.</p>
<p t="3916990" d="2560">It might be a little higher than that.</p>
<p t="3919550" d="4080">It&#39;s hard to measure IQ in the U of T population
because a lot of people have English as a</p>
<p t="3923630" d="5630">second language and so that makes it harder
to measure crystallized intelligence obviously</p>
<p t="3929260" d="2310">using an English language test.</p>
<p t="3931570" d="6460">But we&#39;ve found, when we&#39;ve done our studies
at the U of T, that the average exceeds 120.</p>
<p t="3938030" d="5820">So, you know, so you guys have the cognitive
power to basically pursue professional level</p>
<p t="3943850" d="3280">careers.</p>
<p t="3947130" d="8710">From 110 to 115: manager, supervisor, programmer,
teacher, general manager, purchasing agent,</p>
<p t="3955840" d="2500">registered nurse, sales account executive.</p>
<p t="3958340" d="2210">These are actually empirically derived, by
the way.</p>
<p t="3960550" d="4490">So the Wonderlic company has tested a very
large number of people.</p>
<p t="3965040" d="4750">And so these are the actual averages of the
professions that they are describing--it&#39;s</p>
<p t="3969790" d="5710">not hypothetical.</p>
<p t="3975500" d="13030">103 to 108, so that&#39;s the 60 to the 70th percentile:
clerk, customer service rep, computer operator,</p>
<p t="3988530" d="5340">medical debt collector, secretary, accounting
clerk, general sales, telephone sales, assistant</p>
<p t="3993870" d="3790">manager, credit clerk, drafter, designer,
bookkeeper.</p>
<p t="3997660" d="7520">There&#39;s a lot of white-collar, like low level,
entry level, white collar jobs in that particular</p>
<p t="4005180" d="1000">category.</p>
<p t="4006180" d="5520">So that would be the brighter people among
the high school students who didn&#39;t go to</p>
<p t="4011700" d="1390">college and university.</p>
<p t="4013090" d="6840">IQ, this is dead average, 50th to the 55th
percentile: police officer, receptionist,</p>
<p t="4019930" d="7020">cashier, general clerical staff, inside sales
clerk, meter reader, printer, teller, data</p>
<p t="4026950" d="3600">entry, electrical, helper, dispatcher, general
office.</p>
<p t="4030550" d="2490">So that&#39;s right at 100.</p>
<p t="4033040" d="7880">95 to 98, so that&#39;s the 42nd to the 45th percentile:
quality control checker, claims clerk, security</p>
<p t="4040920" d="1910">guard or unskilled labourer.</p>
<p t="4042830" d="7471">So look, the unskilled labourers are up at
95th of 98, so that&#39;s--at the unskilled labour</p>
<p t="4050301" d="3799">level you still have an IQ that&#39;s higher than
40% of the population.</p>
<p t="4054100" d="4250">Ark welder, die setter, mechanic, medical
dental assistant.</p>
<p t="4058350" d="8640">IQ 87 to 93: messenger, factory production
worker, assembler, food service worker, nurse&#39;s</p>
<p t="4066990" d="3360">aid, warehouseman, custodian, janitor, material
handler, and packer.</p>
<p t="4070350" d="8350">Okay, so now what you see happening--it looks
to me like you can conceptualize jobs most</p>
<p t="4078700" d="3490">simply with a two by two matrix.</p>
<p t="4082190" d="5900">Okay, so there&#39;s managerial/administrative
jobs and creative jobs--that&#39;s the first one--and</p>
<p t="4088090" d="2990">then there&#39;s low complexity/high complexity.</p>
<p t="4091080" d="5230">And so, what you&#39;re starting to fall into
at the 21st to the 37th percentile--so that&#39;s</p>
<p t="4096310" d="4619">still one person in three--are low complexity,
managerial jobs.</p>
<p t="4100929" d="5190">And so what I mean by that is, if you&#39;re in
a low complexity job, imagine you&#39;re responsible</p>
<p t="4106119" d="1761">for 30 things.</p>
<p t="4107880" d="3409">But roughly speaking, it&#39;s the same 30 things
all the time.</p>
<p t="4111289" d="4270">And roughly speaking, they have to be taken
care of the same way each time.</p>
<p t="4115559" d="4970">So you have a finite domain of responsibility
and you can master it.</p>
<p t="4120529" d="4510">And IQ will predict how fast you master it,
but once you master it, it won&#39;t predict how</p>
<p t="4125039" d="1091">well you do.</p>
<p t="4126130" d="4810">What happens then, in all likelihood, is that
conscientiousness starts to predict, or maybe</p>
<p t="4130940" d="3930">emotional stability starts to predict, or
some of the other personality factors start</p>
<p t="4134870" d="1090">to become more important.</p>
<p t="4135960" d="7910">So, but at 87 to 93, you&#39;re down at the level
of custodian and janitor.</p>
<p t="4143870" d="2039">And then that&#39;s that.</p>
<p t="4145909" d="11131">And that&#39;s not so good because you have the
bottom 15-20% of the population who don&#39;t</p>
<p t="4157040" d="2420">have a cognitive ability at that level.</p>
<p t="4159460" d="5500">And so one of the things that you&#39;re going
to hear a lot about as you get older is reasons</p>
<p t="4164960" d="1969">for unemployment.</p>
<p t="4166929" d="3830">And one of the prime reasons for unemployment
in the future is increasingly going to be</p>
<p t="4170759" d="5030">that there is just nothing for someone of
that level of intelligence to do.</p>
<p t="4175789" d="4591">And this is partly why people hate IQ, because
you think, that is a nasty nasty thing to</p>
<p t="4180380" d="1000">conclude.</p>
<p t="4181380" d="1359">Let me tell you a story.</p>
<p t="4182739" d="8300">So, I had a client at one point who I suspected
he had a verbal IQ of about 85 and a non-verbal</p>
<p t="4191039" d="1501">IQ that was lower.</p>
<p t="4192540" d="5329">He had other psychological issues, but we&#39;ll
just concentrate on that one for the time</p>
<p t="4197869" d="3721">being.</p>
<p t="4201590" d="2989">And he had a hard time finding a job.</p>
<p t="4204579" d="5441">He was socially anxious and that didn&#39;t help,
but even if he could overcome that it was</p>
<p t="4210020" d="5110">very difficult for him to master the basic
skills that were involved in what you would</p>
<p t="4215130" d="2980">consider even relatively straightforward tasks.</p>
<p t="4218110" d="5410">I spent a lot of time trying to find him a
job, which was insanely difficult.</p>
<p t="4223520" d="6130">He went to the government first to get help,
and they told him to type up his resume on</p>
<p t="4229650" d="2750">a computer and distribute it--it&#39;s like, well
that wasn&#39;t very helpful because he didn&#39;t</p>
<p t="4232400" d="4610">know how to use a computer and he wasn&#39;t going
to type up his damn resume.</p>
<p t="4237010" d="4280">It was, &quot;if you want to get a job, go out
and do the things that it would take to get</p>
<p t="4241290" d="1000">a job.&quot;</p>
<p t="4242290" d="2789">Well yeah, if you can do that then you don&#39;t
have a problem.</p>
<p t="4245079" d="4790">And so the government agencies were completely
useless, and they were staffed by people who</p>
<p t="4249869" d="4150">would assume that if you didn&#39;t do what you
were advised to, then you just didn&#39;t want</p>
<p t="4254019" d="1000">to have a job.</p>
<p t="4255019" d="1801">Instead of ever thinking that maybe you couldn&#39;t
do it.</p>
<p t="4256820" d="4440">It&#39;s not the easy to use a computer.</p>
<p t="4261260" d="4680">And then I tried to get him a volunteer job--well
you can bloody well forget about that because</p>
<p t="4265940" d="3449">it&#39;s harder to get a volunteer job than it
is to get a real job.</p>
<p t="4269389" d="3571">And the reason for that is that you have to
step through a number of complex bureaucratic</p>
<p t="4272960" d="3080">hoops, including having a police check.</p>
<p t="4276040" d="3920">And you know, first of all that&#39;s intimidating
as hell for people, even if they haven&#39;t done</p>
<p t="4279960" d="1000">anything wrong.</p>
<p t="4280960" d="1790">And second, it&#39;s not that straightforward.</p>
<p t="4282750" d="5550">It involves manoeuvring through a complicated
bureaucracy, and that&#39;s not the only step.</p>
<p t="4288300" d="1210">There&#39;s all sorts of other steps.</p>
<p t="4289510" d="3489">So volunteer work, that&#39;s out man.</p>
<p t="4292999" d="3240">That&#39;s just not going to happen, not generally
speaking.</p>
<p t="4296239" d="6531">And then I found him a job helping a guy out
who had a bicycle shop/book store--kind of</p>
<p t="4302770" d="4199">a strange combination--but it was a government
subsidized temporary position.</p>
<p t="4306969" d="4050">And then, he did a good job at it--he was
reshelving books and that sort of thing--and</p>
<p t="4311019" d="1301">so he was reliable.</p>
<p t="4312320" d="1009">He could do that.</p>
<p t="4313329" d="5731">But, you know, the subsidy program ended and
of course, if you run a bike shop/book store</p>
<p t="4319060" d="4389">it&#39;s not like you have additional money to
hire someone because, that&#39;s a store that&#39;s</p>
<p t="4323449" d="4991">just not going to be generating maybe any
income, but certainly not enough to hire someone.</p>
<p t="4328440" d="1829">So that fell apart.</p>
<p t="4330269" d="8270">Then I made a bunch of personal contacts with
charity organizations to see if I could get</p>
<p t="4338539" d="1000">him a volunteer position.</p>
<p t="4339539" d="2520">I finally got him a volunteer position.</p>
<p t="4342059" d="5841">And then I went with him to train at the volunteer
position, and that was so enlightening.</p>
<p t="4347900" d="7659">So what he had to do was, he had a stack of
pieces of paper here and then a stack of envelopes</p>
<p t="4355559" d="5821">here, and in principle the pieces of paper--which
were letters--were in the same order as the</p>
<p t="4361380" d="1380">envelopes were.</p>
<p t="4362760" d="3890">And so what he had to do was fold the pieces
of paper three times and stuff the folded</p>
<p t="4366650" d="4210">piece of paper into the envelope and the seal
the envelope and then put it here.</p>
<p t="4370860" d="4859">But it was a bit more complicated than that
because sometimes the letters were in French</p>
<p t="4375719" d="5550">and sometimes they were in English, so what
that meant was that he had to watch and see</p>
<p t="4381269" d="4491">that the French envelopes went into this stack
and the English envelopes went into that stack.</p>
<p t="4385760" d="2669">So that&#39;s one degree of complexity, right.</p>
<p t="4388429" d="3781">But then it also turned out that those damned
envelopes had to be run through an automatic</p>
<p t="4392210" d="1840">letter sorting machine.</p>
<p t="4394050" d="3660">Now you might think, well that doesn&#39;t matter,
but it does matter because those things have</p>
<p t="4397710" d="4220">very tightly defined tolerances.</p>
<p t="4401930" d="6649">And if you make a mistake--imagine you fold
a piece of paper and the first time you fold</p>
<p t="4408579" d="2660">it you made a mistake of an eighth of an inch.</p>
<p t="4411239" d="2841">And then the next time you fold it you make
another eighth of an inch mistake.</p>
<p t="4414080" d="5389">That means your piece of paper is now one
quarter inch out of truth.</p>
<p t="4419469" d="4071">And then you stuff it in the envelope and
fold it, but then you crinkle the envelope.</p>
<p t="4423540" d="4420">And so then the envelope gets stuck in the
automatic processing machine.</p>
<p t="4427960" d="6090">So I taught him probably 20 hours, how to
fold this piece of paper into three.</p>
<p t="4434050" d="5919">You know, and he was a bit shaky, and he just
didn&#39;t have the fine motor ability or the</p>
<p t="4439969" d="2250">cognitive ability to do that.</p>
<p t="4442219" d="5541">And then--I&#39;ll end with this--when he finally
couldn&#39;t do it anymore, what happened was</p>
<p t="4447760" d="2959">the letters came with photographs attached
to them.</p>
<p t="4450719" d="3520">And then he had to fold the pieces of paper
around the photographs in a way that didn&#39;t</p>
<p t="4454239" d="3571">crumple the photographs so that they could
still fit into the envelopes.</p>
<p t="4457810" d="7150">And each photo was stapled, maybe half an
inch different, per piece of paper.</p>
<p t="4464960" d="5119">So then he had to fold them properly with
a different folding technique for every piece</p>
<p t="4470079" d="4600">of paper, and he had to sort them into French
and English, and then also if the envelopes</p>
<p t="4474679" d="4161">and the papers ever got out of sync--which
they did now and then--he had to figure out</p>
<p t="4478840" d="3460">how to sort the envelopes and the pieces of
paper to make sure that they were matched</p>
<p t="4482300" d="1000">with the proper envelope.</p>
<p t="4483300" d="1199">It was like, no.</p>
<p t="4484499" d="3401">That was the end of it.</p>
<p t="4487900" d="4159">And so I&#39;ll tell you the rest of this story
later.</p>
<p t="4492059" d="7061">So anyways, the moral of the story is if you&#39;re
smart, you&#39;re privileged and, thank god, make</p>
<p t="4499120" d="1070">use of it.</p>
<p t="4500190" d="4659">And if you&#39;re on the low end of the IQ distribution,
man, you&#39;ve got one tough life ahead of you.</p>
<p t="4504849" d="4330">It has nothing to do with willingness to work,
or virtually nothing.</p>
<p t="4509179" d="14810">And it&#39;s a good thing to know, even though
it&#39;s horrible.</p>
