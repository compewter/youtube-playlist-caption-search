<p t="3120" d="1540">speaking to the audience that actually</p>
<p t="4980" d="1500">includes witches and wizards</p>
<p t="7120" d="500">so...</p>
<p t="8560" d="1560">(voice from the audience)</p>
<p t="10360" d="3160">ye, I&#39;ll probably...I&#39;ll probably meet them in the question period,</p>
<p t="13780" d="1100">that will be my guess</p>
<p t="15060" d="2000">So, can you all hear me?</p>
<p t="17320" d="2000">One of you can  hear me</p>
<p t="20380" d="2000">How was that</p>
<p t="22380" d="1980">That&#39;s better? Ok</p>
<p t="24360" d="1640">All right. Good</p>
<p t="26420" d="1680">All right. So</p>
<p t="29680" d="1180">As you can plainly see</p>
<p t="30860" d="760">the title of this talk is</p>
<p t="31820" d="1060">&quot;Dragons,</p>
<p t="32880" d="500">Divine Parents,</p>
<p t="33520" d="2440">Heroes and Adversaries:</p>
<p t="35960" d="1900">A complete cosmology of being&quot;</p>
<p t="38400" d="2000"> </p>
<p t="40400" d="560"> </p>
<p t="40960" d="2300">Sounds dreadfully New Age to me</p>
<p t="43640" d="1920">But it&#39;s not</p>
<p t="45560" d="1620"> </p>
<p t="47180" d="1500"> </p>
<p t="48680" d="500"> </p>
<p t="49180" d="1400">New age people are very creative</p>
<p t="50620" d="1420">But they can&#39;t think critically</p>
<p t="53660" d="800">But I can think critically</p>
<p t="55900" d="1000">So this is a creative</p>
<p t="60140" d="500"> </p>
<p t="62140" d="1300">theoretical enterprise</p>
<p t="64040" d="2000">Conjoint with the capacity</p>
<p t="66040" d="941">to tell the difference</p>
<p t="66981" d="500">between  bad ideas</p>
<p t="67540" d="1380">and good ideas</p>
<p t="69800" d="1020">And hopefully</p>
<p t="71140" d="940">what I&#39;m going to talk to you about</p>
<p t="72200" d="1620">are the graetest ideas  that humanity</p>
<p t="73960" d="1560">has ever produced</p>
<p t="77120" d="1060">They&#39;re are also ideas,</p>
<p t="78260" d="680">that we&#39;re....</p>
<p t="78940" d="1880">we dont understand well...</p>
<p t="81700" d="700">and</p>
<p t="84740" d="2440">who&#39;s highest level of formal developement</p>
<p t="88080" d="1900">we risk forgetting because</p>
<p t="91080" d="1160">we&#39;re criticising things</p>
<p t="92240" d="1040">that we</p>
<p t="94360" d="3860">we&#39;ve invented as a species, but that that we can not undersand rationally, and....</p>
<p t="99120" d="1480">We predisposed to believe that</p>
<p t="101860" d="3160">Ideas that we can&#39;t understand rationally have to be wrong</p>
<p t="105400" d="4020">...and sometimes that&#39;s true; but sometimes we&#39;re just not smart enough to understand them</p>
<p t="110440" d="520">so...</p>
<p t="113900" d="3740">I can give you an example of something that we are not really smart enough to understand.</p>
<p t="118740" d="4080">We are not really smart enough to understand, why people would line up for four nights...</p>
<p t="122820" d="2180">...for ten blocs to watch Star Wars,</p>
<p t="126540" d="2200">You know ;  I mean; they won&#39;t do that for a lecture.</p>
<p t="129800" d="2220">( laughter )</p>
<p t="132920" d="2000">...and they wouldn&#39;t pay money...</p>
<p t="136260" d="3240">So, you know, that Star Wars, for example, is naturally</p>
<p t="140300" d="1540">...is naturally interesting.</p>
<p t="142800" d="2000">Anad people just take that for granted.</p>
<p t="145320" d="2000">But the fact, that people would line up..</p>
<p t="147900" d="5180">To..to engage voluntarily in the ritual activity of that sort...</p>
<p t="155460" d="4560">..is a manifestation of something that is very deep in human psyche, that we do not comprehend well.</p>
<p t="162220" d="1740">So, I&#39;m gonna talk to you about</p>
<p t="164660" d="2740">What I like to think about as &quot; a grammar of believe&quot;</p>
<p t="169040" d="3120">I got interested in this, back in the mid-eighties</p>
<p t="172840" d="600">I was..</p>
<p t="173520" d="1800">..I was driven mostly by the interest in...</p>
<p t="178360" d="3980">...global warfare that was ideologicaly motivated, and also atrocity...</p>
<p t="183480" d="4480">Warefare was not so difficult to understand in some sense because you can map it on to...</p>
<p t="188560" d="2000">...animal teritoriality...</p>
<p t="192140" d="3580">But atrosity in a service of ideology is a wholle different thing</p>
<p t="196600" d="3180">There is certanly clearer that for example in a World War II,</p>
<p t="200540" d="3220">When the Nazis had to make a choice....perhaps between winning the war ...</p>
<p t="203760" d="2920">And excelerating the rate in which they were killing Jews...</p>
<p t="206680" d="1580">...they chose the latter!</p>
<p t="209400" d="4360">And it&#39;s very difficult to understand that  using a model based on the animal teritoriality</p>
<p t="216760" d="1220">I started reading...</p>
<p t="218580" d="780">about</p>
<p t="220420" d="1720">believe systems widely...</p>
<p t="222400" d="500">..in..</p>
<p t="224860" d="4080">... political writtings, and economic writtings, and religion writtings and psychological writtings</p>
<p t="228940" d="2880">Anywhere I could find a tread that i thought was promising</p>
<p t="232220" d="1440">I red a lot  of Jung,</p>
<p t="233800" d="1040">I red a lot of Freud,</p>
<p t="234840" d="2920">Almost all  the  great clinical psychologists</p>
<p t="238120" d="2640">A lot of Solzhenitsyn, a lot of George Orwell</p>
<p t="243300" d="2641">A lot of people, lot of Dostoyevsky and Nietzsche</p>
<p t="245941" d="4419">They&#39;re all people who, as far as I can tell,  have something very original to say</p>
<p t="251860" d="760">...and...</p>
<p t="254200" d="1160">Out of that...</p>
<p t="258700" d="3000">I learned to understand why people need Believe</p>
<p t="262080" d="1600">Why is actually inevitable</p>
<p t="264220" d="2600">Why fait is inevitable</p>
<p t="266920" d="4760">Fait is inevitable in part because your knowlage is fine, and than so, you have to take some things for granted</p>
<p t="271680" d="1400">Or you fall into an infinite regres</p>
<p t="275360" d="3880">And what, maybe constituted the difference between pathological believe...</p>
<p t="279480" d="1400">...and non pathological believe</p>
<p t="281280" d="2640">And those are terms, by the way, that I think can be defined technically</p>
<p t="284760" d="1120">Which is a...</p>
<p t="286400" d="3780">...statement that&#39;s runs contrary to the pre-supposition, say, of moral relativism</p>
<p t="290480" d="2460">I&#39;m definately not a moral relativist</p>
<p t="293740" d="2260">I think, it constitues a..</p>
<p t="296460" d="4940">I think the motivation for moral relativism fundamentally is the desire to abdicate  responsibility</p>
<p t="302480" d="2940">Even though you can make a strong intelectual cases for</p>
<p t="305580" d="2220">...for why moral relativism is correct</p>
<p t="309780" d="3880">The intelectual case in an actual motivation have nothing to do with one another however...</p>
<p t="316500" d="5380">I&#39;ve also found out something else, which is quite interesting, and I dont know how much I can touch on it tonight, but...</p>
<p t="322360" d="3440">...I&#39;dont think that Newton and Darwin are commensurate</p>
<p t="327360" d="3320">I think that most modern peoples are Newtonians, not Darwinians</p>
<p t="331620" d="5540">And I think that , you can understand the grammar of believe, which is religious in nature</p>
<p t="337680" d="1860">Using Darwinian&#39;s principals</p>
<p t="340460" d="3800">But it means that you have to give up your Newtonian&#39;s pre-suppositions</p>
<p t="344620" d="980">And so..</p>
<p t="346140" d="4280">I think    I can make that argument implicitly with  what I&#39;m doing as   I progress tonight</p>
<p t="350420" d="2260">So the first thing I&#39;m going to tell you  is that</p>
<p t="353360" d="4120">Its necessary for you to look at the world through the limited frame of reference</p>
<p t="358440" d="2460">Other  reason for that  is  -  you&#39;re not very smart</p>
<p t="361840" d="4180">Your consciousness can only hundle about four bits of information per second</p>
<p t="366380" d="4800">It&#39;s not very much given that the number of bits of informations comming at you from external world are</p>
<p t="371620" d="2000">Pro  practical purposes   infinite</p>
<p t="374260" d="2760">You&#39;re like Aldous Huxley  sugested</p>
<p t="377180" d="3320">Your brain seems to be  primarily reducing agent</p>
<p t="381220" d="2260">Yyour bodies are reducing agent as well, because</p>
<p t="383660" d="1840">There are a lot of things that  you just can&#39;t detect and than...</p>
<p t="385820" d="2300">Tthe room that you sitting in is a reducive agent because</p>
<p t="388240" d="1820">Is keeping all sort of things  out</p>
<p t="390240" d="1600">Tthat you would  otherwise have to deal with, and</p>
<p t="392140" d="3140">The stability of the city is reducing agent because</p>
<p t="395280" d="4600">We&#39;re not going to be stampeded by barbarians with any luck at every moment or any moment</p>
<p t="401120" d="540">..we..</p>
<p t="401980" d="2540">...we deal with the complexity of the wotld in part by</p>
<p t="404620" d="2680">Iinhabiting a sequence of  reducing structures</p>
<p t="407300" d="3860">Until the world is reduced enough so that we can actually</p>
<p t="411160" d="2340">Deal with the minute elements of it that we can</p>
<p t="413580" d="1640">Comprehend at any one moment</p>
<p t="415780" d="1960">And those are elements we comprehend</p>
<p t="418180" d="640">...am..</p>
<p t="420300" d="2380">Are not the familiar objects of</p>
<p t="422680" d="900">objective reality</p>
<p t="423740" d="500">Iin fact</p>
<p t="424740" d="740">Animals</p>
<p t="425660" d="1180">and people included</p>
<p t="426840" d="2520">Are not much interested in ojective reality</p>
<p t="432620" d="1120">We&#39;re interested in</p>
<p t="433740" d="1700">pragmatic reality</p>
<p t="437020" d="1140">Pragmatic reality is</p>
<p t="438160" d="1760">the reality you act on</p>
<p t="439920" d="1160">Not that you percieve</p>
<p t="441700" d="860">And because we&#39;re</p>
<p t="442720" d="1240">embeded in bodies</p>
<p t="444160" d="1060">And because we are biological organisms</p>
<p t="445340" d="1380">And because we are concerned</p>
<p t="446900" d="1220">with survival and reproduction</p>
<p t="448120" d="1420">Among other things</p>
<p t="449900" d="860">How to act is</p>
<p t="450940" d="1960">a much more important</p>
<p t="452900" d="1580">Much more important question for us then</p>
<p t="454480" d="2320">What is the the world constituted of</p>
<p t="460120" d="980">How to act</p>
<p t="461120" d="640">In some sense</p>
<p t="461820" d="1700">is also the prime Darwinian question</p>
<p t="464020" d="1260">Right? Because if you act</p>
<p t="466540" d="960">wrongly</p>
<p t="467640" d="2120">from a Darwinian perspective you end up dead</p>
<p t="469760" d="1000">before you can reproduce</p>
<p t="473140" d="2000">So Darwinism</p>
<p t="475140" d="1540">Is a pragmatic</p>
<p t="478240" d="840">theory</p>
<p t="479080" d="700">In fact</p>
<p t="479860" d="2280">The pragmatysts, the... the american pragmatists on the ...</p>
<p t="482440" d="500"> </p>
<p t="483500" d="1700">North American east coast</p>
<p t="485760" d="1300">Recognised that</p>
<p t="488560" d="1220">Very short period of time</p>
<p t="489860" d="1560">after Darwin&#39;s studies was published</p>
<p t="491540" d="1800">They recognised the connection between</p>
<p t="493420" d="1260">pragmatism as a theory</p>
<p t="494860" d="560">and</p>
<p t="495560" d="1600">Darwinian theory</p>
<p t="498400" d="1140">instantaneously</p>
<p t="502260" d="1420">So the world tht we inhabit</p>
<p t="504480" d="1180">given that we&#39;re alive</p>
<p t="506420" d="560">And given that</p>
<p t="506980" d="920">What&#39;s selected as &quot;selected&quot;</p>
<p t="508100" d="1220">As to act is</p>
<p t="509340" d="1480">Actually the  pragmatic world</p>
<p t="512040" d="1940">And the objects of pragmatic worlds</p>
<p t="513980" d="1040">aren&#39;t objects</p>
<p t="515100" d="1040">They&#39;re tools</p>
<p t="516140" d="1720">And obstacles</p>
<p t="518380" d="1720">And they have valiance</p>
<p t="520160" d="1200">a  priority!  They&#39;re....</p>
<p t="521520" d="2240">They have value A priority</p>
<p t="523900" d="2440">From the Newtonian&#39;s perspective you look at the world</p>
<p t="527980" d="1280">And then you think about the world</p>
<p t="529260" d="780">that you see</p>
<p t="530040" d="1520">The objects of the world that you see</p>
<p t="531560" d="980">And than you evaluate them</p>
<p t="532540" d="740">And then you act</p>
<p t="533280" d="1900">That is not how the brain works</p>
<p t="535900" d="1420">Is just wrong</p>
<p t="539480" d="1360">You might see the value of things</p>
<p t="540860" d="920">before you see</p>
<p t="541780" d="900">the object itself</p>
<p t="543400" d="1420">I mean...there are people  for example</p>
<p t="544880" d="860">Who are blind</p>
<p t="545780" d="880">They are blindsight</p>
<p t="546680" d="1300">They can recognise emotions or faces</p>
<p t="548000" d="1220">without knowing</p>
<p t="549220" d="1060">thay  can see</p>
<p t="551100" d="540">So</p>
<p t="552060" d="720">That&#39;s partialy</p>
<p t="552780" d="2480">Because the retina is attached to they&#39;r amygdala</p>
<p t="556260" d="940">The retina is attached</p>
<p t="557300" d="860">to  lot of your body</p>
<p t="558500" d="1280">Not just your visual cortex</p>
<p t="559780" d="1440">It&#39;s attached to your spinal cord</p>
<p t="561220" d="1100">It&#39;s attached to your nervous system</p>
<p t="562320" d="2800">at multiple levels of analysis simultaneously</p>
<p t="565180" d="1740">And, so you can use your eyes</p>
<p t="566960" d="500">to detect things</p>
<p t="567460" d="1860">That you dont know you&#39;re seeing</p>
<p t="570380" d="500">So</p>
<p t="570880" d="1700">Than in some sense</p>
<p t="572600" d="2880">What you&#39;re after  to detect in those circumstances is..</p>
<p t="576160" d="1160">&quot;valience&quot; - value so</p>
<p t="577320" d="1880">You&#39;re very good for example</p>
<p t="579640" d="1480">at detecting teeth</p>
<p t="581820" d="540">and</p>
<p t="582360" d="1400">predatory eyes and</p>
<p t="583760" d="1560">the reasons for that are</p>
<p t="585600" d="880">self evident</p>
<p t="586700" d="840">Fundamentally</p>
<p t="590280" d="1820">This is the smallest  unit</p>
<p t="592600" d="1000">of meanning that makes up</p>
<p t="593720" d="1480">a referential frame</p>
<p t="595360" d="500">I think</p>
<p t="596840" d="600">It has</p>
<p t="597980" d="940">three elements</p>
<p t="599760" d="2120">One of which links the mind to the body</p>
<p t="602040" d="1120">Actually  the mind-body problem</p>
<p t="603260" d="1160">is not that difficult to solve</p>
<p t="604420" d="1580">If once you take a pragmatic..</p>
<p t="606780" d="1520">Once you look at how the brain works</p>
<p t="608300" d="1340">from the pragmatic perspective</p>
<p t="609640" d="940">Because then</p>
<p t="610720" d="500">you&#39;re</p>
<p t="611220" d="900">your consciousness</p>
<p t="612120" d="1040">Is fundamentally something</p>
<p t="613160" d="1640">That is grounded in action</p>
<p t="615100" d="2000">And you can undersand the transition</p>
<p t="617100" d="1480">Between consciousness and action</p>
<p t="618580" d="1640">As a sequence of ...of</p>
<p t="620220" d="1780">Analysis that are increasingly</p>
<p t="622000" d="1300">Action oriented</p>
<p t="623420" d="1540">I&#39;ll talk to you about it a little bit later</p>
<p t="624960" d="2280">But the basic framework is something like this</p>
<p t="627240" d="1380">And you&#39;re always looking at the world</p>
<p t="628740" d="1020">Through this framework</p>
<p t="629760" d="1620">And the framework has one point</p>
<p t="631380" d="1800">Where you are and what you&#39;re doing</p>
<p t="633180" d="1860">Where you are now</p>
<p t="635040" d="1380">So that&#39;s point &quot;A&quot;</p>
<p t="636800" d="2240">You always trying to get from point &quot;A&quot; to point &quot;B&quot;</p>
<p t="639100" d="1000">Because you are linear creature</p>
<p t="640260" d="980">And you&#39; re embodied</p>
<p t="641280" d="1140">So you are moving</p>
<p t="642420" d="880">And so... fundamentally</p>
<p t="643300" d="1960">What you looking at the world through</p>
<p t="645260" d="940">Is a sequence of maps</p>
<p t="646200" d="1420">And maps tell you</p>
<p t="647620" d="1540">How to get to where you want to go</p>
<p t="649400" d="2200">And so..the maps specify where you are</p>
<p t="651600" d="1500">Because obviously you can&#39;t get anywhere</p>
<p t="653260" d="1040">If you don&#39;t know where you are</p>
<p t="654780" d="2000">And many people of course are confused where they are</p>
<p t="656780" d="1400">So they dont get anywhere</p>
<p t="658740" d="2340">And you also has to know where are you going</p>
<p t="661520" d="1440">And that&#39;s point &quot;A&quot; and point &quot;B&quot;</p>
<p t="662980" d="1340">And every time you look at the world</p>
<p t="664360" d="1680">You&#39;re looking through a framework</p>
<p t="666120" d="2200">That has those two valued points implicit</p>
<p t="668840" d="2060">In your cognitive structure</p>
<p t="670900" d="2160">And generaly what you think is</p>
<p t="673820" d="2160">&quot;Where you going is better than where you are&quot;</p>
<p t="676200" d="2000">Because otherwise why would you go there?</p>
<p t="678360" d="1200">Now. Some people do choose</p>
<p t="679740" d="840">To go to the places</p>
<p t="680580" d="500">That are worse  that</p>
<p t="681080" d="640">Where they are</p>
<p t="681780" d="1020">But they are &quot;special case&quot;</p>
<p t="683000" d="2000">You probably live with some of them</p>
<p t="685200" d="2020">( audience laughs)</p>
<p t="689560" d="1140">Now, when you&#39;re  going</p>
<p t="690780" d="1860">From point &quot;A&quot; to point&quot;B&quot;</p>
<p t="692680" d="2000">Fundamentally you have to move</p>
<p t="694980" d="2000">And movement is not &quot;abstract&quot;</p>
<p t="697460" d="2000">Movement is what you do with your body</p>
<p t="699780" d="2840">And so..once your abstract representation</p>
<p t="702860" d="1920">Transform itself into action</p>
<p t="705020" d="2260">You are no longer in the realm of abstraction</p>
<p t="708280" d="1580">So in order to get from one place to another</p>
<p t="709860" d="1220">You have to know where you are</p>
<p t="711080" d="2060">And you have to know where you&#39;re going</p>
<p t="713140" d="2700">And you have to what?  fly ,run, roar</p>
<p t="716440" d="1120">You have to perform</p>
<p t="717740" d="1440">Some sort of ambodied action</p>
<p t="719180" d="500">To get there</p>
<p t="720080" d="1640">And of course you have conscious control</p>
<p t="721840" d="1380">over your volountary muscular system</p>
<p t="723320" d="2000">But underneath that you dont realy have enything at all</p>
<p t="725320" d="1200">Right? you can move your arm</p>
<p t="726780" d="2200">You have no idea what muscles you&#39;re moving</p>
<p t="729220" d="2620">So that your conscious representation of your body</p>
<p t="731960" d="2000">Grounds out basicly involountary movement</p>
<p t="733960" d="2060">of the larger muscles systems</p>
<p t="736560" d="680">So</p>
<p t="738460" d="760">Now you might ask</p>
<p t="739240" d="2000">What does specify</p>
<p t="741240" d="1040">Where you&#39;re going</p>
<p t="742360" d="1020">And the answer to that,</p>
<p t="743380" d="760">In large part is biology</p>
<p t="744260" d="2000">But biology in a complex manner</p>
<p t="746420" d="1400">And this is where the higher order</p>
<p t="747820" d="1900">Morality starts to become a concern</p>
<p t="750540" d="2260">You share with other animals</p>
<p t="753360" d="2540">All the way down the fild of genetic chain</p>
<p t="756380" d="1260">Various forms of</p>
<p t="757640" d="3280">of implicit motivation and, you know, you can kind of lump those</p>
<p t="760920" d="1240">It&#39;s arbitrary</p>
<p t="762180" d="2460">I lump them into &quot;self-mainenance&quot; motivations</p>
<p t="764640" d="2060">And &quot;self-propagation&quot; motivations</p>
<p t="766740" d="2000">You can pack it different ways</p>
<p t="768740" d="1420">Like I said: it&#39;s more conseptual</p>
<p t="770500" d="2000">Than based on-say-you know</p>
<p t="772500" d="1540">Anatomy</p>
<p t="774040" d="1120">But it&#39;ll do</p>
<p t="775160" d="1420">&quot;Self-maintenance&quot; well</p>
<p t="776580" d="1240">You don&#39;t want to get too hot</p>
<p t="777820" d="1380">You don&#39;t wonna get to cold</p>
<p t="779200" d="1220">Your hypothalamus deal with that</p>
<p t="780420" d="1440">Very old part of the brain</p>
<p t="781860" d="2240">Is way more important than your cortex</p>
<p t="784320" d="2560">You can take the whole cortex of the female cat</p>
<p t="786900" d="2000">And as long as you keep it in the cage</p>
<p t="788900" d="1500">And it has its hypothalamus</p>
<p t="790400" d="1160">It can pretty much behave</p>
<p t="791560" d="620">Like a cat</p>
<p t="792180" d="2060">Exept that is hypo-exploratory</p>
<p t="794240" d="1540">Which is the last thing you&#39;d expect</p>
<p t="795780" d="1500">From an animal with no brain</p>
<p t="799420" d="860">You can&#39;t be too hot;</p>
<p t="800280" d="1080">You can&#39;t be too cold</p>
<p t="801600" d="2000">You got to regulate your water intake</p>
<p t="803600" d="1540">You have to eat</p>
<p t="805940" d="2000">You have to deal with  consequences of eating</p>
<p t="807940" d="1400">You have to be with other people</p>
<p t="809340" d="960">There is a place circuit,</p>
<p t="810340" d="1240">A specialised place circuit</p>
<p t="811820" d="2640">There is a specialised erotic circuit</p>
<p t="815160" d="2420">There is specialised circuit for exploration</p>
<p t="817640" d="2340">Which is...it.does  half what the hypothalamus does, by the way</p>
<p t="822200" d="1840">And those systems</p>
<p t="824040" d="1160">They often have been conceptualized</p>
<p t="825200" d="760">as &quot;drives&quot;</p>
<p t="826260" d="1060">But they not really that</p>
<p t="827320" d="940">They more like</p>
<p t="828760" d="2940">Isolated one eye personalities</p>
<p t="831980" d="1560">They&#39;re like Cyclops</p>
<p t="833960" d="1620">They want one thing</p>
<p t="835580" d="1280">Now, they&#39;re not stupid</p>
<p t="836940" d="2000">But they not very...</p>
<p t="838940" d="1900">...amenable to argument</p>
<p t="840840" d="1580">So when you&#39;re hungry</p>
<p t="842420" d="720">You&#39;re hungry</p>
<p t="843180" d="1760">And, you know, another motivational system</p>
<p t="844940" d="1200">might object to that</p>
<p t="846140" d="1500">But..and that&#39;s happens frequently,</p>
<p t="847700" d="2560">Which is partly why people are often confused,</p>
<p t="850280" d="2000">And also why you need a cortex</p>
<p t="852280" d="1280">Because, you know, you need a cortex</p>
<p t="854680" d="2000">To allow the computic motivational system</p>
<p t="856740" d="2840">To array them-selves properly and harmonously</p>
<p t="859600" d="1120">Across time</p>
<p t="860720" d="1520">so they all get they do</p>
<p t="862320" d="2260">Insted of fighting like two years-old&#39;s in the room</p>
<p t="864680" d="2380">Because two-year old&#39;s a basicaly hypothalamic</p>
<p t="867280" d="840">You know. So there are lots of fun</p>
<p t="868120" d="1420">But they are not organised</p>
<p t="869540" d="1180">And they are not social at all</p>
<p t="871640" d="2000">So what happens with the motivational system</p>
<p t="873640" d="1440">Is very deep in your brain</p>
<p t="875080" d="1100">Is they</p>
<p t="877060" d="2200">They specify the value of where you are</p>
<p t="879260" d="980">So one of the values</p>
<p t="880240" d="1820">might be...I&#39;m thirsty</p>
<p t="882440" d="1140">And than</p>
<p t="883800" d="1560">They tune your perception so that</p>
<p t="885840" d="1520">Things that are associated with</p>
<p t="887540" d="1480">The quenching of thirst</p>
<p t="889220" d="2780">Are much more likely to be picked up by your perceptual system</p>
<p t="892200" d="1500">And they bias your</p>
<p t="894200" d="1100">Perceptual processing</p>
<p t="895300" d="1280">And your valuation</p>
<p t="896600" d="1500">towards the.....</p>
<p t="898460" d="2000">Towards improvement of that</p>
<p t="900460" d="1580">motivational lack</p>
<p t="902680" d="2000">And so you can&#39;t really think of them as drives</p>
<p t="904980" d="1620">Because they way more complicated than that</p>
<p t="906600" d="1340">They specify where you are</p>
<p t="907940" d="1640">So there is an element of self-consciousness</p>
<p t="909580" d="1140">That associated with that</p>
<p t="910720" d="1320">&quot;I&#39;m thirsty&quot;</p>
<p t="912400" d="2000">And they specify your target</p>
<p t="914400" d="1560">Usualy using fantasy</p>
<p t="915960" d="1440">You know, when you get thirsty</p>
<p t="917400" d="1360">You think : what I&#39;d like to drink and</p>
<p t="918760" d="1500">You&#39;ve little fantasy about</p>
<p t="920260" d="2260">Maybe a glass of juice or a bit of water</p>
<p t="922580" d="1140">Or something like that and</p>
<p t="923720" d="960">And then your nervous system</p>
<p t="924800" d="1500">Is tuned and you walk into a kitchen</p>
<p t="926300" d="2120">And you ignore everything</p>
<p t="928440" d="2080">That&#39;s irrelevant to the serch for</p>
<p t="930900" d="3200">Liquid and you focus on everything that relevant</p>
<p t="934100" d="1480">To the serch for liquid and</p>
<p t="935580" d="1620">Thats means you so blind</p>
<p t="937200" d="1260">You can not believe it</p>
<p t="938460" d="1520">There&#39;s been many experiments now</p>
<p t="939980" d="1220">That have shown that</p>
<p t="941960" d="1560">You can do things like</p>
<p t="943520" d="1900">I&#39;m sure that some of you seen this</p>
<p t="945420" d="1180">You can introduce a gorilla</p>
<p t="946600" d="1800">Into a basketball game</p>
<p t="948720" d="2440">and 60% or 70%  of the people watching</p>
<p t="951160" d="1440">As long as they paying attention to the ball</p>
<p t="952600" d="1040">They wont see the gorilla</p>
<p t="953640" d="1360">And it&#39;s not like a little, tiny gorrila</p>
<p t="955000" d="1120">That somewhere of in the corner</p>
<p t="956120" d="1500">It&#39;s like  maine centre</p>
<p t="957920" d="1840">6 feet high beatting his chest</p>
<p t="959760" d="1600">And, even when you know that</p>
<p t="961360" d="1660">If something else chenges in the background</p>
<p t="963020" d="1020">You wont see that either</p>
<p t="964040" d="1460">So as far as you guys know</p>
<p t="965520" d="1000">that...</p>
<p t="966960" d="1820">Carpet could be changing colour</p>
<p t="968780" d="1120">50; 20 times a minute</p>
<p t="969900" d="1060">You wouldn&#39;t even notice it</p>
<p t="970960" d="2480">Unless, you have some weird obsession with carpets</p>
<p t="974200" d="540">So...</p>
<p t="976100" d="1840">Ok. So that&#39;s the beginning</p>
<p t="978060" d="800">In some sense</p>
<p t="978880" d="1780">Of the universal system of values, right?</p>
<p t="980660" d="1860">And I can tell you how universl this is</p>
<p t="982520" d="1320">I always have to tell the story</p>
<p t="983840" d="800">Because its dumb funny</p>
<p t="984720" d="1280">I just cannot believe it</p>
<p t="986200" d="500">..So...</p>
<p t="988000" d="2100">One of the things that your brain is very concern with</p>
<p t="990100" d="1560">Is relative status</p>
<p t="991660" d="1048">That&#39;s why you&#39;re in</p>
<p t="992708" d="552">By the way</p>
<p t="993260" d="880">Which is</p>
<p t="994220" d="1640">Partly why relative poverty</p>
<p t="995860" d="1700">Is often such a social problem</p>
<p t="997560" d="2000">People hate being low in status</p>
<p t="999920" d="1340">Specially man</p>
<p t="1001780" d="1380">Male status hierarchy</p>
<p t="1003160" d="840">Is a bit different than women</p>
<p t="1004100" d="1840">And women are pretty sensitive to status too</p>
<p t="1005940" d="1580">But they use different markers</p>
<p t="1007520" d="820">Anyways</p>
<p t="1008660" d="1220">Part what happens</p>
<p t="1009880" d="880">When your status go up</p>
<p t="1010780" d="2400">Is that your brain serotonin level goes up</p>
<p t="1013260" d="1880">And when your brain serotonin level goes up</p>
<p t="1015500" d="3080">You&#39;re less irritable and you expierience</p>
<p t="1018580" d="1080">Less negative emotion</p>
<p t="1019660" d="1940">Per unit of uncertenity your threat</p>
<p t="1022080" d="2000">And so when you demean someone</p>
<p t="1024220" d="2000">And you interfiere with</p>
<p t="1026540" d="2900">And you lower they presume status</p>
<p t="1029440" d="1340">As far as the very primodial</p>
<p t="1030780" d="1500">Circuit is concern</p>
<p t="1032440" d="2820">You alter the system that regulates their emotions</p>
<p t="1035340" d="1660">And they hate that</p>
<p t="1037000" d="1940">People hate that more than anything</p>
<p t="1038960" d="2180">And it&#39;s an unbelieveble archaic circuit</p>
<p t="1041140" d="1640">You can kind&#39; tell this because</p>
<p t="1042780" d="1200">Depresed people</p>
<p t="1043980" d="1920">Basicaly act like they are low status</p>
<p t="1045900" d="1720">And depress people  are depress about</p>
<p t="1047620" d="1660">Everything</p>
<p t="1049500" d="1920">Now. There is not easy to be depressed</p>
<p t="1051420" d="1760">About everything, right?</p>
<p t="1053180" d="1520">And so the fact that that the case</p>
<p t="1054880" d="1860">Means that whatsever gone estray</p>
<p t="1056740" d="1860">Has to be very primodial</p>
<p t="1058600" d="1560">Because it efects everything</p>
<p t="1060540" d="1340">anyways</p>
<p t="1061880" d="1420">People often use</p>
<p t="1063300" d="2500">anty-depressant to cure depression</p>
<p t="1066080" d="1540">Hence their name</p>
<p t="1068640" d="2000">and anty-depressants</p>
<p t="1070900" d="3100">Decrease the rate in which serotonin is taken back up</p>
<p t="1074000" d="1540">By the nurons that produce it</p>
<p t="1075740" d="940">well...</p>
<p t="1078960" d="2000">300 millions years ago</p>
<p t="1080960" d="1500">Crustaceans emerged</p>

<p t="1085600" d="2000">Even if they&#39;re not particulary social</p>
<p t="1088260" d="1240">And if one lobster fights with another</p>
<p t="1089500" d="1160">And gets defeated</p>
<p t="1090660" d="1540">Than he won&#39;t fight with another lobster</p>
<p t="1092200" d="1800">Even if he beats for 20 minutes</p>
<p t="1094320" d="2000">Unless you give him anty-depressant</p>
<p t="1097160" d="2000">In which case he will fight right away</p>
<p t="1099160" d="1600">The reason I&#39;m telling you this</p>
<p t="1100760" d="1020">is because</p>
<p t="1101960" d="2000">The status structure, that...</p>

<p t="1118260" d="2000">It&#39;s not learned</p>
<p t="1120440" d="1740">By no means</p>

<p t="1124740" d="2420">You wonder around inside one of this little frames</p>

<p t="1135140" d="1160">And you get there</p>
<p t="1136300" d="500">Than</p>
<p t="1136900" d="1700">There is another point &quot;A&quot;and another  point &quot;B&quot;</p>
<p t="1138600" d="940">and</p>
<p t="1139540" d="1340">Thats kind of interesting too because</p>
<p t="1140880" d="1980">One of the thing that suggest is that</p>
<p t="1143500" d="2220">Getting somwhere isn&#39;t really what people want</p>
<p t="1145900" d="2300">Because as soon as you get somwhere than you&#39;re done going there</p>
<p t="1148200" d="1760">And then you have to go somwhere else,so</p>
<p t="1150200" d="3280">In some sense it seams it is an acomplishment and in another sens it is just</p>
<p t="1154460" d="4200">The next go up on the mountain, and we all know this because you know, you all graduated from the university</p>
<p t="1158660" d="4980">And that was a good day but the next day you were&#39;nt  university student, you were just some unemployed looser</p>
<p t="1164120" d="3900">You  know, and so, and that&#39;s sets up the whole new set of problems, right?</p>
<p t="1168100" d="2500">And that how the whole frame shifts</p>
<p t="1170680" d="3800">And when the frame shifts like that , than the value of everything shifts around it</p>
<p t="1176440" d="4520">Turns out  that people are actually  more interested in getting from point A to point B</p>
<p t="1180960" d="3260">Than they are in actually being at point B</p>
<p t="1184460" d="5480">And all the positive emotions that you feel which is related to dopaminergic circuitory by the way</p>
<p t="1190020" d="4320">You experience in relationship  to the pursuit of the value goal</p>
<p t="1194340" d="2240">Rather than to attainment of the goal</p>
<p t="1196640" d="2640">The attainment of the goal actually satisfies you</p>
<p t="1199380" d="4480">Or more specificlly it satisfy that motivational circuit,but then the dumb thing just shuts off</p>
<p t="1203860" d="2640">And another one starts yelling at you</p>
<p t="1206500" d="2300">So is like pervers form of victory</p>
<p t="1210360" d="3460">One answer to that that universal in some sense is that</p>
<p t="1213820" d="3460">You should establish a relationship with the transcended value</p>
<p t="1217660" d="3020">Because it never runs out of motivational power</p>
<p t="1221020" d="4440">You can see an example of that , popular example in popular culture in a &quot;Pinoccio&quot; movie</p>
<p t="1225520" d="2000">How many of you&#39;ve seen that</p>
<p t="1227900" d="2180">Is anybobody not seen it?</p>
<p t="1230640" d="2000">Hmmm, thats amusing</p>
<p t="1232640" d="1620">Anyways</p>
<p t="1235080" d="2140">In the &quot;Pinoccio&quot; movie one of the things that happens is</p>
<p t="1237220" d="1320">When Gepetto wishes</p>
<p t="1238680" d="3180">That his son becomes a fully developed individual insted of the dumb puppet</p>
<p t="1242260" d="2000">Which is a good thing for parent to wish, by the way</p>
<p t="1244540" d="4900">He wishes upon a star and a star is signify something of the transcendent value, and so</p>
<p t="1249600" d="5080">The meaning of that fundamentally  is, that if you want to raise your child to be an independent being</p>
<p t="1254680" d="3340">Than you better set your site on something trascendent or it won&#39;t happened</p>
<p t="1258040" d="2940">And believe me there is a lot of time that it  doesn&#39;t happened</p>
<p t="1263000" d="4340">Part of the utility of the transcendent value is that it never looses its motivational effectiveness</p>
<p t="1267360" d="3300">Now you might say that is no prove that they are transcendent values,</p>
<p t="1270720" d="2600">It&#39;s like- yee, thats true,but you know,there is more to the story</p>
<p t="1274220" d="1340">Ok, so..</p>
<p t="1276620" d="3480">When you in one of this little stories, which is basically what they are,</p>
<p t="1280160" d="5060">The simplest story :I was in one place; I went by this means to another place</p>
<p t="1285340" d="1700">Thats the simplest story</p>
<p t="1287040" d="1320">Its not that exciting</p>
<p t="1288380" d="3840">Much more exciting story is :&quot; I was going from point &quot;A&quot; to &quot;B&quot; and something weird happened&quot;</p>
<p t="1292320" d="3480">&quot;And than I didnt know where I was; and than I was in chaos for</p>
<p t="1295840" d="1980">...you know, two years, and than...</p>
<p t="1297880" d="2920">I figured out how to climb out of there&quot; Everybody likes that story, right?</p>
<p t="1300800" d="2920">Thats the death and re-birth story by the way or...</p>
<p t="1303720" d="1800">A fall from paradise story</p>
<p t="1305660" d="2240">With the regaining of the paradise at the end</p>
<p t="1308080" d="2660">You know, its an archetypal story because everyone lives it</p>
<p t="1310740" d="1480">And so...</p>
<p t="1313120" d="2000">Anyways, when you in one of this little</p>
<p t="1315900" d="2540">...Stories....frames of reference...</p>
<p t="1318460" d="2740">What you see in front of you are really things that</p>
<p t="1321660" d="3340">One of the best scientist who ever study visual perception</p>
<p t="1325320" d="2000">Called</p>
<p t="1327800" d="3660">The book&#39;s called : &quot;Ecological approach to visual perception&quot;</p>
<p t="1331820" d="2000">He called them &quot;affordances&quot;</p>
<p t="1334180" d="2380">And affordance is something that affords you something</p>
<p t="1336560" d="1960">And affordances can be both:positive and negative</p>
<p t="1338540" d="2860">I like to think of than as a tools or obstracles</p>
<p t="1341400" d="6100">So for example; If I need to make a B line for that door you guys are all instantly obstracles</p>
<p t="1347500" d="2780">And the way I would respond to that</p>
<p t="1350480" d="2600">Like, implicitly, is that: you all be negative</p>
<p t="1353140" d="2000">So imagine that we just set fire</p>
<p t="1355720" d="4620">Well you were people the minute before that, but, you know, the second after that you&#39;re obstrucles</p>
<p t="1360640" d="4020">And your emotional reaction to the people that are in front of you are going to reflect that</p>
<p t="1364700" d="2720">You all know that because you drive,  you know and...</p>
<p t="1367420" d="4420">Once you encapsulated in your little insect-toy-shell</p>
<p t="1371880" d="4740">And dont&#39;t have to deal with the immediat  responses of  other people, you gonna treat them like obstracles</p>
<p t="1376620" d="3720">And like, you know, demonic obstracles at the drop of a hat</p>
<p t="1380600" d="2760">And , you know that&#39;s pretty much  automatic behaviour</p>
<p t="1383420" d="3100">So, two other things that get you to where you wanna go,</p>
<p t="1386520" d="4100">And you remember, you know, human beings are tool using animals &quot; per excelence&quot;, right?</p>
<p t="1390760" d="2580">We are so tool using that, thats what we see</p>
<p t="1393340" d="1920">It&#39;s build right in to us</p>
<p t="1395380" d="3460">We always scanning the world for tools, when you look at gravel for example</p>
<p t="1398880" d="3740">What you actually see are throwing size rocks</p>
<p t="1402640" d="4500">That&#39;s why they manifest themselves as that kind of object to the enviroment, you know</p>
<p t="1407240" d="4940">You&#39;re build at certain level of resolution and the way your nervous system parts up the world is</p>
<p t="1412180" d="3720">Into things that are useful for you and things that aren&#39;t</p>
<p t="1415900" d="1680">And those are not objects</p>
<p t="1418260" d="2000">The whole idea of object is a...</p>
<p t="1420540" d="4220">...Very, very modern derivative of that mach more primodial system</p>
<p t="1424760" d="7240">And its, by no means, clear at all that our notion of objects is more real than the notion of affordance</p>
<p t="1432000" d="2180">In fact, as far  as your brain is concerned</p>
<p t="1434360" d="1440">Objects</p>
<p t="1435980" d="1780">...no one cares about objects...</p>
<p t="1437780" d="4120">What your brain cares about are affordances, and what your brain is adapted to</p>
<p t="1441960" d="3140">Is the world as a set of affordances and obstracles</p>
<p t="1445140" d="4680">And if you are Darwinian, its very difficult to escape the conclusion</p>
<p t="1449960" d="3740">That what selected you is reality</p>
<p t="1454040" d="5520">And so that if the reality that selected you shape you so that what you see are affordances and obstracles</p>
<p t="1459560" d="1340">Or you die</p>
<p t="1461140" d="2160">Then is perfectly real preposition</p>
<p t="1463300" d="5600">Perfectly resonable proposition to state that what reality is , in fact</p>
<p t="1468900" d="3680">Is the set of affordances, tools and obstracles</p>
<p t="1472640" d="2100">And that is how your brain works, by the way,</p>
<p t="1474780" d="2620">When you look at..there,look at the projector</p>
<p t="1477400" d="1900">Maybe I&#39;m thinking about picking it up?</p>
<p t="1479460" d="4680">What happens is my eyes activate a part of my motocortex that would adjust my hand</p>
<p t="1484140" d="1240">To grip it like that.</p>
<p t="1485400" d="4680">And so part what I understand as a projector is grip-able object</p>
<p t="1490620" d="2000">And thats not secondary deravation,</p>
<p t="1492620" d="3460">I dont see the object and than think this is how I would grip it</p>
<p t="1496080" d="1660">Its like that would take forever</p>
<p t="1498120" d="3120">You know, you&#39;d never catch a baseball if that&#39;s what you&#39;re were doing</p>
<p t="1501260" d="3440">Its like &quot; Oh, a round object is...clunk!...&quot; You know, its like...</p>
<p t="1504700" d="1300">Thats just not gonna work.</p>
<p t="1506000" d="3760">Really, your nervous system is no where fast enough to do that consciously</p>
<p t="1509860" d="3720">You&#39;re using reptile&#39;s circuitry to catch baseballs</p>
<p t="1513580" d="2280">The mammalian staff is to dump slow</p>
<p t="1515920" d="4720">So you catch the ball often, especially if someone piches it fast before you can even see it!</p>
<p t="1520640" d="1560">You just think you sow it</p>
<p t="1522200" d="1860">You see it after you caught it!</p>
<p t="1524280" d="2460">The case with table players too</p>
<p t="1526880" d="3860">They...what they seam to do is judge where the ball is going to go by the angle of the racket</p>
<p t="1530800" d="5400">Because if they wait till the ball is of the racket, they can&#39;t move fast enough to hit it back</p>
<p t="1536200" d="1940">They don&#39;t have the reflexes for it</p>
<p t="1538240" d="3460">So they can&#39;t move the neuromessages fast enough to do it!</p>
<p t="1542980" d="4200">Ok, so basically, the world lay itself as tools and obstracles</p>
<p t="1547400" d="2400">And, you know, obstracles make you feel bad</p>
<p t="1549820" d="4100">But like , lets say: I&#39;m looking at this room and I&#39;m thinking about you guys as an obstracles</p>
<p t="1553980" d="2400">You might say how bad does that make me feel?</p>
<p t="1556380" d="3400">And answer to that is : not very bad, because all I have to do is, you know</p>
<p t="1559820" d="2520">Make a circuit this route and I can get to the door</p>
<p t="1562560" d="6040">So than the fact that you&#39;re obstracles is a very minor impediment to the execution of my plan</p>
<p t="1568720" d="4500">And as a consequence it will produce corespondingly low level of negative emotion</p>
<p t="1574740" d="3000">So. You can think of those as known unknowns.</p>
<p t="1577860" d="1380">In Rumsfeld terms</p>
<p t="1579480" d="3160">Known unknowns are not that biger problem because you can plan for them</p>
<p t="1582680" d="4800">And you might have a plan that&#39;s atlernative plan that you can put in place in case they show up</p>
<p t="1588020" d="3240">What people really don&#39;t like are unknown unknowns</p>
<p t="1591660" d="4700">And unknown unknownes , you don&#39;t walk around those , man. They blow your whole map.</p>
<p t="1596600" d="3560">And your map is quite comlicated. Its actually hierarchical in structure.</p>
<p t="1600160" d="1120">And I &#39;ll get to that.</p>
<p t="1601280" d="5340">Because, you know, you go from point &quot;A&quot; to point &quot;B&quot;so that you can go to a  bigger point &quot;A&quot; to point &quot;B&quot;</p>
<p t="1606620" d="1100">You know</p>
<p t="1607720" d="2040">You cross the road to get to the library</p>
<p t="1609760" d="1820">To study for the exam, to  pass the exam</p>
<p t="1611580" d="1320">To get your degree, to get the job</p>
<p t="1612900" d="1860">To be a person, to be a citizen, to be a , you know</p>
<p t="1614760" d="1320">To have a good life</p>
<p t="1616600" d="2000">So then if someone gets in your way</p>
<p t="1618600" d="4200">While you crossing the road, then to some degree, they&#39;re interfering with you getting the good life</p>
<p t="1622800" d="1640">Now, not very much</p>
<p t="1624520" d="1980">But sometimes you react like that</p>
<p t="1626500" d="3140">That&#39;s certenly happens when you dealing with the intimate partner, you know,</p>
<p t="1629640" d="1720">Because they will make some little mistake</p>
<p t="1631360" d="7260">And you&#39;ll say &quot;You always do that, you&#39;ve always done that, you always do and you&#39;re always going to do it&quot;</p>
<p t="1638640" d="2980">Which is really not a good way to conduct an argument</p>
<p t="1642760" d="1000">So...</p>
<p t="1643760" d="1800">Unknown unknowns.</p>
<p t="1645600" d="5540">Well,  unknown unknowns leap at you from places that you wouldn&#39;t expect.</p>
<p t="1651620" d="2280">Because otherwise you would have planned for the dumb things,</p>
<p t="1653900" d="3600">So there are the things, that always like poke their beak up at you</p>
<p t="1657500" d="1340">When you least expect it</p>
<p t="1658840" d="2640">They are just like, say, serpents in the Garden of Eden</p>
<p t="1661480" d="3800">That might be one way of thinking about it. You can&#39;t keep the dumb snakes out of the garden.</p>
<p t="1665560" d="4460">And that&#39;s because you can&#39;t make the bound the area and keep the complexity out of it.</p>
<p t="1670040" d="4400">The complexity always sneaks back in, try protecting your children from the internet</p>
<p t="1674440" d="1400">For example</p>
<p t="1676280" d="3220">You can&#39;t make the bounded  circumstances and get rid of the complexity,</p>
<p t="1679520" d="2000">It always comes sneaking back in</p>
<p t="1681660" d="3420">So, what would be an unknown unknown? This is a good one here:</p>
<p t="1685180" d="2680">You have an intimate relationship . You&#39;ve had it for ten years.</p>
<p t="1687860" d="1620">You trust your partner</p>
<p t="1689480" d="1600">So, what does that  mean?</p>
<p t="1691080" d="1280">You know where you are</p>
<p t="1692700" d="2300">You know who you are</p>
<p t="1695620" d="2500">And you have pretty good idea of where you&#39;re going!</p>
<p t="1698280" d="1540">And then one day you find out that</p>
<p t="1699820" d="1680">Your partner have been cheating on you</p>
<p t="1701620" d="2400">Not with one person , but with three people!</p>
<p t="1704020" d="2040">And for the whole ten years!</p>
<p t="1706980" d="2660">Well, hipotheticaly that comes as a shock!</p>
<p t="1709660" d="4800">Or thou, you may have ignored many intimations that such might be the case</p>
<p t="1714460" d="1340">Irrelevant!</p>
<p t="1715800" d="3540">Lets say that it comes as a shock! Well , what happends to you?</p>
<p t="1719460" d="2360">Now you don&#39;t know where you are !</p>
<p t="1722420" d="1940">You don&#39;t know where you&#39;ve been!</p>
<p t="1724360" d="1520">That&#39;s interesting, hey?</p>
<p t="1725900" d="3140">Because you think you know where you&#39;ve been, because you&#39;ve already been there!</p>
<p t="1729100" d="4100">But all of the sudden something can happen so that you are so fliped over</p>
<p t="1733300" d="1700">That you dont even knowwhere you were</p>
<p t="1735260" d="4820">So that means in some sense , that past is dependent on the present</p>
<p t="1740080" d="1920">Very peculiar thing</p>
<p t="1742000" d="2040">You also have no idea where you going</p>
<p t="1745800" d="2100">In terms of not knowing where you are</p>
<p t="1748640" d="2000">That&#39;s deep, hey? Because you might think</p>
<p t="1750700" d="3040">&quot;Well ,  I , you know , I thought I was in the marriage, that turns out to be wrong</p>
<p t="1754060" d="2600">I thought I knew who my wife or husband was</p>
<p t="1756660" d="1820">That turns out to be wrong</p>
<p t="1759200" d="4580">I concluded on the bases that I knew my wife that I knew something about woman</p>
<p t="1764000" d="1140">That turns out to be wrong</p>
<p t="1765720" d="2980">I thought I was in the relationship with someone I can trust</p>
<p t="1769080" d="1060">That is wrong</p>
<p t="1770240" d="3160">I don&#39;t know enough about trust, I&#39;m obviously to galuble</p>
<p t="1773520" d="4060">And so , what that does it throw, vertualy everything that&#39;s ever happened to me</p>
<p t="1777580" d="1680">in severe doubt, right?</p>
<p t="1779320" d="2000">That the emergence of chaos!</p>
<p t="1782200" d="2000">And that&#39;s ...</p>
<p t="1785100" d="880">...this!...</p>
<p t="1786040" d="1020">Sometimes,</p>
<p t="1787660" d="2000">You are going from point &quot;A&quot; to point &quot;B&quot;</p>
<p t="1789800" d="3580">And something you don&#39;t expect manifest itself , in the middle of your plan.</p>
<p t="1793380" d="1680">But its not such a catastrophy.</p>
<p t="1795060" d="1100">Because you can just look around it</p>
<p t="1796180" d="5500">And then sometimes, something pops up and like , you just do not have a plan anymore!</p>
<p t="1801740" d="1820">And so then you might ask yourself</p>
<p t="1803560" d="3800">Just exactly where are you when you dont know where you are.</p>
<p t="1807940" d="2380">And I would say: that&#39;s a place</p>
<p t="1810340" d="2780">And its actually a place that&#39;s well documented in ...</p>
<p t="1814060" d="2440">...clasic , religious  and mitological  stories</p>
<p t="1816520" d="1000">Thats Chaos</p>
<p t="1817520" d="1500">The Daoists , for example</p>
<p t="1819060" d="2440">They believe  that the world is made out of Chaos and Order</p>
<p t="1821960" d="3900">Order : that&#39;s where you are when what you do gets you what you want</p>
<p t="1826520" d="660">Chaos</p>
<p t="1828120" d="2820">That&#39;s where you are when you have not idea what&#39;s going on</p>
<p t="1830940" d="1180">And you might ask: well</p>
<p t="1832120" d="2820">Is there a way that you should act when you in Chaos?</p>
<p t="1835140" d="2400">And the anwer to that is : there better be</p>
<p t="1837540" d="3300">Because it&#39;s a place you going to visit several times during your life</p>
<p t="1841380" d="1940">And everyone visits that</p>
<p t="1843900" d="1980">That&#39;s why it&#39;s an archetypal story</p>
<p t="1845880" d="2040">Thats the descent to the underground</p>
<p t="1847920" d="4960">Underground is that horrible place that lurks underneath all our presuppositions</p>
<p t="1853420" d="720">Its the...</p>
<p t="1854140" d="4180">...frigid lake underneath thin ice that everybody is skating on</p>
<p t="1858580" d="2700">And is something that can manifest itself at any moment</p>
<p t="1861280" d="3780">Tha&#39;ts , probably why in the Dao&#39;s  symbol the black paisley is Chaos, by the way</p>
<p t="1865080" d="1800">and the white pisley is Order</p>
<p t="1866980" d="3580">In the  Order paisley, there is the little black dot</p>
<p t="1870560" d="3980">Thats because Order can change into Chaos , and  does,  at any moment</p>
<p t="1875760" d="2440">And the revers is also true</p>
<p t="1878200" d="1800">Chaos can turn into Order at any moment</p>
<p t="1880000" d="1720">And inside will do that for you</p>
<p t="1881860" d="1980">You know; alcoholics report that</p>
<p t="1883900" d="4020">When they hit bottom is like &quot; Khh&quot;  there is the catalyses and they look at the world in a different way</p>
<p t="1888220" d="2160">You know; now they are new person</p>
<p t="1890380" d="1320">They back from the underground</p>
<p t="1891700" d="2740">They&#39;ve risen from the dead, so to speak</p>
<p t="1894440" d="4560">You know; and it&#39;s partly because what looks like your right hemisphereis pretty good at</p>
<p t="1899320" d="4640">Infering patterns in novel and chaotic places;</p>
<p t="1903960" d="2720">It&#39;s, kind of, keeping track of things that happened to you that are anomalous</p>
<p t="1906680" d="3060">And it makes alternatives maps of the world</p>
<p t="1909780" d="1660">That are there for you to rely on</p>
<p t="1911440" d="2860">At least to some degree if that ever becomes necessary</p>
<p t="1914980" d="1520">Now, you might ask yourself</p>
<p t="1916500" d="4180">How upset should you be  when something that you don&#39;t expect happens</p>
<p t="1920680" d="3180">Now, it turns out that that&#39;s is really a difficult question to answer</p>
<p t="1923860" d="4200">Because, what the problem is that when something you dont expect happens</p>
<p t="1928060" d="1560">You don&#39;t know what it is!</p>
<p t="1929620" d="3760">And so, then you might say &quot;well, how upset should you get?&quot; and the answer to that is</p>
<p t="1934520" d="1320">You don&#39;t know.</p>
<p t="1936780" d="1440">And so what happens is</p>
<p t="1938220" d="3280">First of all you &#39;ve got some build in approximators</p>
<p t="1941660" d="1680">One would be...your...</p>
<p t="1945380" d="2960">Geneticaly determined level of nuroticism</p>
<p t="1948340" d="2480">Which is basicaly sensitivity to negative emotion</p>
<p t="1950820" d="6260">If you more sensitive to negative emotion, you gonna manifest more psycho-phisiological preperation</p>
<p t="1957080" d="2380">Per unit of treat or uncertainty</p>
<p t="1959460" d="3460">Which is to say some people get more upset about the same thing</p>
<p t="1962920" d="700">Than other people do!</p>
<p t="1963740" d="1120">Now who is right?</p>
<p t="1964980" d="860">Well....</p>
<p t="1966300" d="720">Who knows?</p>
<p t="1967020" d="2320">You wake up in the morning and there is a little ache in your side</p>
<p t="1969340" d="1480">it&#39;s like, well, what is that?</p>
<p t="1970860" d="1840">it&#39;s sore muscle or cancer?</p>
<p t="1972780" d="660">You don&#39;t know!</p>
<p t="1973660" d="2600">And if you hipochondrical , well its gonna be cancer!</p>
<p t="1976340" d="960">And sometimes</p>
<p t="1977320" d="1700">The hypochondriac is right!</p>
<p t="1979020" d="2980">And so he is the one that lives when it goes to the emergency room</p>
<p t="1982000" d="2060">And finds out exactly wha&#39;ts going on</p>
<p t="1984060" d="2200">So its an ununswerable question</p>
<p t="1986460" d="3080">Now, the other way that your brain determins how upset you should be is</p>
<p t="1989540" d="2600">By calculating your position on the dominance hierarchy</p>
<p t="1992140" d="2380">Because the higher you are on the dominance hierarchy</p>
<p t="1994520" d="1940">The more resorces you have at your disposal</p>
<p t="1996460" d="3700">And so , the less upset you have to get when anything horrible happens</p>
<p t="2000160" d="3560">So if you berely clinging to the bottom of the social structure</p>
<p t="2003720" d="3960">You can be sure that your brain is going to estimate any anomalous occurance as a catastrophy</p>
<p t="2007680" d="3860">Which is why people don&#39;t like being at the bottom of the dominance hierarchy</p>
<p t="2011640" d="3360">And is also why people who are there die a lot sooner</p>
<p t="2015460" d="2240">And they do.. they die a lot sooner</p>
<p t="2018080" d="2960">Regardless of their absolute level of wealth</p>
<p t="2021680" d="2620">It&#39;s relative deprivation that counts</p>
<p t="2024420" d="4060">Ok, so here is a bit of a clue about how else your brain might calculate</p>
<p t="2028520" d="1700">How upset you should be</p>
<p t="2030220" d="3400">Here is a little map of me when I&#39;m doing something</p>
<p t="2033620" d="2360">That I frequently do; which is to write a manuscripts</p>
<p t="2036060" d="3100">So you might say &quot; What are you doing when you&#39;re writing a manuscript?&quot;</p>
<p t="2039160" d="2280">And that turns out to be a very complicated question</p>
<p t="2041440" d="3000">It&#39;s like &quot;What you&#39;re doing when you read a book?</p>
<p t="2044640" d="560">Well...</p>
<p t="2046000" d="2640">You&#39;re writting letters or typing them</p>
<p t="2048740" d="2640">You&#39;re typing words, you typing frases</p>
<p t="2051380" d="1360">You&#39;re typping sentences</p>
<p t="2052740" d="1320">You&#39;re typing paragraphs</p>
<p t="2054260" d="4640">You&#39;re typing the structure that the paragraphs fit in to- that&#39;s will be the essay</p>
<p t="2059080" d="500">Ok?</p>
<p t="2060020" d="1040">Then you&#39;re...</p>
<p t="2061900" d="5220">Me, anyways, I&#39;m practising science because I usually write some scientific manusripts</p>
<p t="2067160" d="2900">And that&#39;s part of embodying my profesorial</p>
<p t="2070060" d="1760">Role and then that&#39;s part of</p>
<p t="2071820" d="2460">Hypoteticaly, being a productive citizen</p>
<p t="2074280" d="1100">Or  thou, some of you might...</p>
<p t="2075420" d="560">You know</p>
<p t="2075980" d="1520">differ to that , given that I&#39;m a professor</p>
<p t="2077740" d="560">And then</p>
<p t="2078460" d="1760">Perhaps on outside of that</p>
<p t="2080220" d="3820">This is what I think is on the outside of that is : I&#39;m confronting the unknown</p>
<p t="2084880" d="1760">And you might say , well...</p>
<p t="2087220" d="2700">What are you really doing when you&#39;re writting a sentence</p>
<p t="2089980" d="2660">And the answer to that is : you&#39;re doing all of this things better or worst</p>
<p t="2092640" d="3460">And if you&#39;re doing realy good job of writing your sentence you&#39;re doing all of them at once</p>
<p t="2096100" d="3440">And thst would be one of the things that would make the sentence particularly meanningful</p>
<p t="2099800" d="500">Now...</p>
<p t="2100400" d="5760">If something anomalous occurs  , let say , the letter &quot;T&quot; on my typewritergets stuck,</p>
<p t="2106160" d="2900">Well thats gonna irritate me because then I can;t type the sentence</p>
<p t="2109060" d="2520">Now it&#39;s not gonna irritate me too much because, you know</p>
<p t="2111580" d="3980">It does&#39;t realy interfiere with my ability to be a productive citizen</p>
<p t="2115960" d="1800">So, I&#39;m going to</p>
<p t="2118280" d="1160">Estimate</p>
<p t="2119440" d="2560">The magnitude of how upset I should be</p>
<p t="2122000" d="1520">When something unknown occures</p>
<p t="2123560" d="7240">By estimating where in the hierarchy of action that anomaly is dysruptive</p>
<p t="2130800" d="2060">Ok, so, let me run you through this again</p>
<p t="2132940" d="1580">So lets say :</p>
<p t="2135060" d="1600">What&#39;s  &quot; a good person?&quot;</p>
<p t="2136660" d="2440">And you might think of that from the objective perspective</p>
<p t="2139140" d="1760">But that would be a mistake</p>
<p t="2141120" d="560">Because</p>
<p t="2141800" d="3080">A quality , like good , is a pragmatic quality</p>
<p t="2144900" d="2580">If it&#39;s based on action, not on object</p>
<p t="2147480" d="3100">So , here is how you decompose being a good person</p>
<p t="2151220" d="500">So...</p>
<p t="2154200" d="2720">A good person is a good parent; more than that</p>
<p t="2156920" d="1200">That&#39;s the subcomponent, right?</p>
<p t="2158120" d="3340">A good parent is someone who has a job and takes care of the family</p>
<p t="2161460" d="3000">And then, the person who takes care of their family is like</p>
<p t="2164460" d="1500">They can play with the baby</p>
<p t="2165960" d="1240">Or they can complete the meal</p>
<p t="2167200" d="1700">This are abstract concepts</p>
<p t="2168900" d="2360">You can&#39;t tell the four year old &quot; Make a meal&quot;</p>
<p t="2171260" d="3840">And the reason you can;t is because they dont know  the subordinate components of making the meal</p>
<p t="2175240" d="2220">You can say: &quot; See that fork?&quot;</p>
<p t="2178200" d="1840">Hopefully they know what the fork is</p>
<p t="2180200" d="6060">&quot;See that fork?&quot; &quot;Yes&quot; &quot;Pick up that fork and bring that fork to the table and put it there&quot;</p>
<p t="2186260" d="1040">They can do that</p>
<p t="2187300" d="2440">Because their nervous system is organaised enough</p>
<p t="2189740" d="1900">To operate at that level of abstraction</p>
<p t="2191780" d="1920">But they can&#39;t do something like</p>
<p t="2193700" d="980">&quot;Make a meal&quot;</p>
<p t="2194680" d="3540">Which is, you know, if you got a three year old you can&#39;t put them in their room and you say:</p>
<p t="2198220" d="840">&quot;Clean up your room!&quot;</p>
<p t="2199220" d="1040">They will just look at you</p>
<p t="2200260" d="2400">And then when you come back in half an hour</p>
<p t="2202660" d="1400">They will look at you again!</p>
<p t="2204200" d="3960">You can say: &quot;Hey! Kid ! See that Teddy Bear?&quot;</p>
<p t="2208560" d="500">&quot;Yeh&quot;</p>
<p t="2209060" d="3460">&quot;Pick up the Teddy Bear, and put it on that space in the wall&quot;</p>
<p t="2212520" d="3560">And than once you teach the three years old how to do a hundred of those things</p>
<p t="2216080" d="760">And they got it</p>
<p t="2216840" d="1740">They&#39;ve got a little motor rutines</p>
<p t="2218580" d="1840">You can say&quot; Clean the room&quot;</p>
<p t="2220420" d="1700">You can encapsulate that entire set</p>
<p t="2222120" d="2420">Of motor rutines within the higher order of the concept</p>
<p t="2224660" d="2080">So if your&quot;Being a good person&quot;</p>
<p t="2226740" d="720">Part of that is</p>
<p t="2227460" d="2540">Well, maybe you&#39;re making a meal and the part of that would be</p>
<p t="2230000" d="1420">Well, you&#39;re cutting up the vegetables</p>
<p t="2232140" d="3160">But then the things get interesting because when you are cutting up the vegetables</p>
<p t="2235300" d="2912">What you actually doing is are ripping something and moving</p>
<p t="2238220" d="1960">And than thats no longer abstract</p>
<p t="2240260" d="4380">Right? Thats where your conceptual philosopfical presuppositions</p>
<p t="2244640" d="2400">Like being a good person hit the roo...</p>
<p t="2247040" d="4780">Hit the ...hit the level of embodied material reality</p>
<p t="2251840" d="3340">That&#39;s the disolution of the mind into the body</p>
<p t="2255780" d="540">Now...</p>
<p t="2258100" d="1600">If someone says to you</p>
<p t="2259700" d="2740">&quot;You should cut those vegetables more thinly&quot;</p>
<p t="2263100" d="1600">That might irritate you</p>
<p t="2264940" d="1180">But if they say</p>
<p t="2266120" d="1780">&quot; You are bad parent&quot;</p>
<p t="2268080" d="2400">Maybe observing the same phenomena</p>
<p t="2270480" d="2140">Then you&#39;re going to a fight with them</p>
<p t="2273100" d="2800">And so, the reason for that is , obviously</p>
<p t="2275900" d="2580">If it&#39;s just a matter of cutting the vegetables thinner</p>
<p t="2278480" d="5680">All you have to do is make a minor modification in the hierarchy that constitudes yourself</p>
<p t="2284420" d="2480">Representation or, realy, yourself</p>
<p t="2286900" d="1100">iT&#39;s not juet a representation</p>
<p t="2288000" d="2560">But if you are not a good parent , it&#39;s like</p>
<p t="2290980" d="1920">If that&#39;s true you&#39;ve got a lot of</p>
<p t="2293240" d="1340">You&#39;ve got a lot of repare work to do</p>
<p t="2294580" d="2760">A lot of your world is falling apart</p>
<p t="2297600" d="2940">And as soon as things fall apart , which they always do</p>
<p t="2300540" d="2420">You&#39;re in chaos and as soon as you are in chaos than</p>
<p t="2302960" d="4060">Your body defaults to  emergency preparation and your&#39;re stressed</p>
<p t="2307020" d="2260">And  if you&#39;re stressed long enough then you die</p>
<p t="2309580" d="1900">And so, you don&#39;t like that</p>
<p t="2311480" d="2100">Stress say, when  your body  gets stressed...</p>
<p t="2313580" d="4780">What happens is;  because it doesn&#39;t really know what&#39;s going on it prepares for everything</p>
<p t="2318480" d="3080">That&#39;s the general stress response, cortisol production does that</p>
<p t="2321560" d="2980">Cortisol production is good, it wakes you up in the morning</p>
<p t="2324540" d="2260">But if it&#39;s chronic, you get old</p>
<p t="2327740" d="1260">Like it&#39;s so...</p>
<p t="2329780" d="1840">...general in it&#39;s negative...</p>
<p t="2331620" d="5080">...actions. That the best way to conceptualise its detrimental long term effect</p>
<p t="2336700" d="1560">that its excelerating ageing</p>
<p t="2338260" d="4680">So, it makes you more likely to have heart desease, and cancer, and  depresion, and Altzheimers</p>
<p t="2343300" d="900">And...</p>
<p t="2346060" d="1920">Diabetes and obesity</p>
<p t="2348860" d="880">That will do.</p>
<p t="2350500" d="880">It&#39;s enough!</p>
<p t="2351420" d="2240">Any of those are enough to kill you</p>
<p t="2354340" d="720">All right!</p>
<p t="2355060" d="1220">So there is a hierarchy</p>
<p t="2356280" d="1540">That&#39;s the hierarchy of values</p>
<p t="2358360" d="2000">The higher the values the more</p>
<p t="2360360" d="2280">the less you wanna have it desrupted! Now...</p>
<p t="2364660" d="2560">There is psychologist named Piaget</p>
<p t="2367700" d="2280">Some of  you might know about him</p>
<p t="2373660" d="2000">Piaget was very interested in</p>
<p t="2376460" d="2460">What happens to value structures</p>
<p t="2378920" d="1980">And the hierarchical organisation</p>
<p t="2381660" d="3840">Once they have to apply outside of the confouds of the body</p>
<p t="2385500" d="1860">So, so here is the way to think about it</p>
<p t="2387360" d="2100">Two years olds-basicaly hypothalamic</p>
<p t="2389460" d="1500">Thats why they so much fun!</p>
<p t="2390960" d="2640">First they happy, then they sad, then they hungry, then they tired</p>
<p t="2393600" d="6160">You know, they just zip from one pretty straight forward and rather all inspiring motivational state</p>
<p t="2399800" d="880">To another</p>
<p t="2401040" d="2160">And by they- two, they can&#39;t play</p>
<p t="2403200" d="2200">They will play by themselves</p>
<p t="2405960" d="1240">But they can&#39;t play with other children</p>
<p t="2407200" d="2380">They can&#39;t get that until they three</p>
<p t="2409580" d="1825">And they need to get it by the time they three</p>
<p t="2411405" d="2355">Because if they don&#39;t get it  by the time they four</p>
<p t="2413760" d="1180">They will never get it</p>
<p t="2414940" d="4060">And then you have an antisocial kid who is going to be outsider for his entire life</p>
<p t="2419000" d="2260">And there isn&#39;t anything you can do about it</p>
<p t="2421260" d="2180">So,that has to happen between two and four</p>
<p t="2423480" d="2140">So what happends about age  three is that the kid learns</p>
<p t="2425620" d="1800">How to play a game with another person</p>
<p t="2427420" d="4200">And what that game is, is fundamentally the developement of the ability</p>
<p t="2431620" d="2400">To share a frame of reference</p>
<p t="2434020" d="2200">Which is what you&#39;re doing when you play Monopoly</p>
<p t="2436220" d="2000">It&#39;s like its stupid to play Monopoly</p>
<p t="2438260" d="720">Obviously</p>
<p t="2438980" d="3540">Who cares if you have a whole pile of counterfeit paper</p>
<p t="2442780" d="600">Right?</p>
<p t="2443560" d="3640">But doesn&#39;t matter because the way you constituted is that</p>
<p t="2447280" d="2660">Your brain will treat anything you act</p>
<p t="2450440" d="560">...like...</p>
<p t="2451000" d="4200">Constitutes a valuable goal as if it&#39;s a valid framework of reference</p>
<p t="2455200" d="5620">And if it could&#39;t do that: A-you couldn&#39;t abstract, and B-you could not get along with another people</p>
<p t="2460820" d="4440">So you can sit arounde the table and you can say &quot;Lets pretend that...</p>
<p t="2465260" d="3140">...Monopoly is a reasonable facsimile of reality&quot;</p>
<p t="2468400" d="1200">Which you would&#39;t say</p>
<p t="2469600" d="1620">But it&#39;s what you mean</p>
<p t="2471220" d="4200">And everybody says: &quot;Yes, that would be amusing!&quot;</p>
<p t="2475600" d="960">And so</p>
<p t="2476820" d="4800">Than you say your goal : which is to get a little hotels and all the many</p>
<p t="2481620" d="2160">And Puf! Your emotions go along for the ride!</p>
<p t="2483820" d="1720">And whats so interesting about that is</p>
<p t="2485600" d="1280">You can get everybody in to the game</p>
<p t="2486900" d="2500">And so one of the things that&#39;s realy interesting about people</p>
<p t="2489400" d="3660">Is that we can establish a shared fictional frame of reference</p>
<p t="2493060" d="2880">And it organises all our emotions so they are predictable</p>
<p t="2495940" d="2340">That&#39;s also why we can watch movies!</p>
<p t="2498380" d="2440">You go to the movie you identify the Hero</p>
<p t="2500820" d="1480">You figure  out whet the Hero wants</p>
<p t="2502360" d="1800">Puf! You&#39;re the hero!</p>
<p t="2504260" d="1400">And the way that works is</p>
<p t="2505660" d="5840">You don&#39;t look at the Hero, and think about what is he doing, and evaluate emotionaly, and then feel it</p>
<p t="2511680" d="4760">What you do is you specify the hero&#39;s goal and then you map him on to  your body</p>
<p t="2516500" d="2560">And you read of the emotional responses of your own body</p>
<p t="2519060" d="2500">And that&#39;s how you understand the hero</p>
<p t="2522420" d="1960">So, it&#39;s embodied ...</p>
<p t="2524440" d="3320">You&#39;re using your embodiment as a...</p>
<p t="2527760" d="3960">Computational devise that can run simulations of other consciousnes</p>
<p t="2531720" d="1840">And it does that with the body</p>
<p t="2533560" d="920">And we like doing that!</p>
<p t="2534480" d="1800">You can go to the movie and , you know</p>
<p t="2536420" d="720">You&#39;re...</p>
<p t="2537240" d="2300">Brad Pitt for an hour and a half</p>
<p t="2540560" d="2420">You know, when you&#39;re Brad Pitt doing remarkable things</p>
<p t="2542980" d="2380">And that&#39;s also how we understand other people</p>
<p t="2545360" d="3160">We&#39;re very good at that , so, anyways, we have this share frames of reference</p>
<p t="2548520" d="1840">Like when we&#39; re playing Monopoly</p>
<p t="2550460" d="500">Ok, so</p>
<p t="2550960" d="2140">Children at three learn how to play games</p>
<p t="2553100" d="4600">And that means they  learn how to organise they own internal motivational  states</p>
<p t="2557700" d="4120">Into a hierarchythat includes the motivational states of other people</p>
<p t="2562460" d="1840">And that means they can play</p>
<p t="2564300" d="2040">And that&#39;s what you guys do when you out in the world</p>
<p t="2566340" d="1700">Like, we&#39;re playing the game right now</p>
<p t="2568040" d="940">We all know the rules</p>
<p t="2568980" d="4160">Thats whay we can all sit in this room and play the game without fighting with each other</p>
<p t="2573140" d="4280">You know, and the room is set up like a theatre and we all know thw theatre game</p>
<p t="2577420" d="3180">And so, and the chairs are all facing this way at the moment</p>
<p t="2580600" d="1920">And so that&#39;s a hint that you should look forward</p>
<p t="2582520" d="1740">And this is raised so ...</p>
<p t="2584260" d="2660">You know, the room is basicaly telling you what to do</p>
<p t="2587060" d="2240">Because is a stage, like all rooms</p>
<p t="2589300" d="4100">And because you&#39;re smart and socialy conscious you can walk into a stage room</p>
<p t="2593400" d="1920">And your body knows what to do</p>
<p t="2595440" d="1520">And if you civilised and social</p>
<p t="2596960" d="2600">You just do it, than all the other primates can predict</p>
<p t="2599560" d="2340">What you&#39;re up to, and they won&#39;t kill you!</p>
<p t="2603320" d="3360">Ye! That&#39;s what it means to be part of the same tribe</p>
<p t="2606680" d="2520">You know, when people are very peculiar creatures</p>
<p t="2609200" d="1760">And God only knows what&#39;re they up to</p>
<p t="2610960" d="2276">But as long as the&#39;re playing the same  game you are</p>
<p t="2613240" d="1660">You don&#39;t have to know what&#39;s they up to</p>
<p t="2614900" d="2020">Because you can predict what are they going to do</p>
<p t="2616920" d="2300">And you understand  they motivational states</p>
<p t="2619620" d="6780">And so, part of the building and constructing of higher order of ...higher order..moral ...</p>
<p t="2626780" d="4500">...goals, is the establishment of joint frames of reference</p>
<p t="2631280" d="3780">That allow multiple people to  persue the goals that they&#39;re interested in</p>
<p t="2635060" d="1240">Simultaneously!</p>
<p t="2636300" d="2760">And than, what you have to  think about with regards to that is</p>
<p t="2639060" d="3640">That not all shared frames of reference can manage that</p>
<p t="2642700" d="1900">There is a small subset of them</p>
<p t="2644600" d="3780">That are optimised, so that not only can multiple people play them</p>
<p t="2648680" d="3200">But muliple people can play them, and enjoy them</p>
<p t="2651880" d="3120">And do it repetedl across a long period of time</p>
<p t="2655000" d="5740">So it&#39;s inner abillity that partly defines  the utility of a higher order moral structure</p>
<p t="2660880" d="2080">And that is not that arbitrary!</p>
<p t="2663140" d="3360">It&#39;s the emerging property of biological interactions</p>
<p t="2666500" d="3420">And you might say &quot; Well it&#39;s kind of arbitrary because people can do what they want&quot;</p>
<p t="2669920" d="1440">But it&#39;s not arbitrary at all!</p>
<p t="2671360" d="2880">Because a lot of what constraining your games</p>
<p t="2674240" d="1800">Is your motivational substructure</p>
<p t="2676040" d="3100">And those ancient circuits that are status oriented</p>
<p t="2679300" d="1600">And they operate within</p>
<p t="2681800" d="3360">Virtualy every animal has a status  counter</p>
<p t="2685160" d="3260">Creatures organise themselves into dominance hierarchies</p>
<p t="2688420" d="2200">the reason they do that is because that works</p>
<p t="2690620" d="4580">It&#39;s a solution, it&#39;s a solution to the Darwinian problem of existance</p>
<p t="2695840" d="2000">It&#39;s not just a epiphenomenon</p>
<p t="2697940" d="1280">It&#39;s the real thing</p>
<p t="2699560" d="500">So</p>
<p t="2700060" d="5380">You, your enviroment fundamentaly, a huge chunk of your enviroment is dominance hierarchy</p>
<p t="2705440" d="1860">Plus &quot;God only knows wher you are&quot;</p>
<p t="2707680" d="1760">And that&#39;s Order and Chaos</p>
<p t="2709440" d="3100">And part of the reason that people fight to preserve the dominance hierarchy</p>
<p t="2712540" d="3720">Is because it&#39;s better to be a slave who knows what the hell is going on</p>
<p t="2716260" d="4080">Then someone who is thrown screaming, and naked in to the jungle at night</p>
<p t="2720340" d="2760">And that&#39;s the difference between Order and Chaos</p>
<p t="2723100" d="3540">And, we like order better than chaos and it&#39;s no wonder</p>
<p t="2726680" d="2080">Now we&#39;ll invite a liitle chaos in</p>
<p t="2728760" d="1720">For entertament now and then</p>
<p t="2730480" d="2000">But has to be done voluntarily</p>
<p t="2732480" d="4220">And generally you don&#39;t want the kind of chaos that upsets your entire conceptual structure</p>
<p t="2736700" d="3100">You know, you&#39;re willing to full around on a fringes a little bit but...</p>
<p t="2739800" d="3660">...you know, when your going gets serious you&#39;re pretty much likely to bailout</p>
<p t="2743660" d="880">And no wonder</p>
<p t="2746580" d="2560">Now I want to tell you a little bit about</p>
<p t="2750480" d="1360">This chaotic domain</p>
<p t="2752240" d="1900">I can tell you a couple of yhings about it</p>
<p t="2755400" d="2600">It&#39;s the underworld of mitology</p>
<p t="2758000" d="3200">One of the things that kind of interesting about the underworld is</p>
<p t="2761200" d="3500">That it has a suburband one of the suburbs of the underworld is Hell</p>
<p t="2765260" d="2720">And Hell is the place where you end up when</p>
<p t="2768640" d="2480">Everything that you know falls apart</p>
<p t="2771120" d="2800">And you get resentful and bitter about it</p>
<p t="2774000" d="3480">And that&#39;s very like, one of the things that I noticed in my</p>
<p t="2777480" d="4400">Work as a clinical psychologistis that, there&#39;s two things that realy do people in</p>
<p t="2782180" d="500">Three</p>
<p t="2782680" d="1520">Lying, that&#39;s not good</p>
<p t="2784660" d="1920">Apart from that:  resentment</p>
<p t="2786880" d="1240">And arogance!</p>
<p t="2788280" d="1760">If you get resenful enough</p>
<p t="2790040" d="1960">You and up like Eliot Rogers</p>
<p t="2792060" d="3400">And all those other people who go on  rundom shootings sprees</p>
<p t="2795460" d="3800">Because they have a disagreement about the structure  of existence</p>
<p t="2799260" d="3660">And the fact that they anded up hypothetically at the bottom of the heap</p>
<p t="2802920" d="4560">So those are real places and people gets stuck in them, and they are not places that you would</p>
<p t="2807520" d="3020">Voluntarily choose to go if you had any sens  at all</p>
<p t="2810540" d="2540">And I tell you if you read the accounts</p>
<p t="2813140" d="2640">Of the people who do rundom mass-murder</p>
<p t="2815780" d="2340">they will tell you exactly where they  are</p>
<p t="2818120" d="2280">And they will tell you exactly what they motivated to do</p>
<p t="2820400" d="5180">And what they motivated to do is take as much revenge on existence as they possibly can imagine</p>
<p t="2825580" d="1920">In the most unfaire possible way</p>
<p t="2827520" d="2580">As fast as they can possibly manage it</p>
<p t="2830480" d="3880">And that&#39;s the conscious aim and is not a form of insanity</p>
<p t="2834360" d="1780">They know exactly what they&#39;re doing</p>
<p t="2836600" d="3200">They have precisely idea what are they aiming at</p>
<p t="2839840" d="2000">And it&#39;s a deep archetypal</p>
<p t="2842500" d="720">Posession</p>
<p t="2843220" d="1360">Per lack of a better word</p>
<p t="2847500" d="500">Now</p>
<p t="2850200" d="3120">I wanna show you how some of this things are maped</p>
<p t="2856040" d="960">Symbolically</p>
<p t="2857880" d="4720">They&#39;re not realy symbols, in my estimation, because  a symbol implies</p>
<p t="2863040" d="1600">That something is being</p>
<p t="2865240" d="1100">Represented</p>
<p t="2866340" d="4200">You know, there is reality  behind the representation that&#39;s broader than the representation</p>
<p t="2870540" d="1840">And the symbol is just a shadow of it</p>
<p t="2872380" d="1280">This aren&#39;t symbols</p>
<p t="2873660" d="3800">They&#39;re representations that are exact  as they can possibly be</p>
<p t="2884200" d="4000">I&#39;ll start with something that is rather easy to understand</p>
<p t="2889980" d="560">Lets try</p>
<p t="2896060" d="500">Yes!</p>
<p t="2897220" d="2800">what happends when you look at the Medusa?</p>
<p t="2901840" d="1200">You turn to stone!</p>
<p t="2903040" d="2180">What happends when a rabbits sees a wolf?</p>
<p t="2906480" d="2080">That&#39;s right, it turns  to stone</p>
<p t="2908820" d="1680">That&#39;s right, the Medusa</p>
<p t="2910620" d="1060">Is a symbol</p>
<p t="2912040" d="1520">It&#39;s a representation</p>
<p t="2913560" d="3380">Of all those things that make you turn to stone when you look at them</p>
<p t="2917620" d="640">Now look!</p>
<p t="2918420" d="1840">Animals can deal with treat</p>
<p t="2920480" d="500">Right?</p>
<p t="2920980" d="2340">They have instincts to deal with treat</p>
<p t="2923320" d="3520">But zebras, maybe there is a bunch of zebras then they out there in herd</p>
<p t="2927580" d="580">And</p>
<p t="2928160" d="1940">There is a bunch of lions and they right there</p>
<p t="2930100" d="1480">And the zebras : what are they doing ?</p>
<p t="2931640" d="1040">They graizing.</p>
<p t="2932680" d="3180">And you think: &quot;Whow! Those zebras aren&#39;t very bright because there is a bunch of lions</p>
<p t="2935860" d="4360">Like why aren&#39;t they , you know, in the forest building a fort to keep the lions out</p>
<p t="2940220" d="4300">But, the reason they&#39;re not doing that is because although they can react to threat</p>
<p t="2944660" d="4700">They can not conceive of the class of threatening objects</p>
<p t="2950180" d="4280">Now human being can conceive of the class of threatening objects</p>
<p t="2954460" d="3400">And so, what&#39;s civilization is in a large part is an attempt</p>
<p t="2957860" d="2960">To find the remedy for the class of threatning objects</p>
<p t="2960820" d="2780">Now there are representations of those sorts of things</p>
<p t="2963600" d="1180">The Medusa is one of them</p>
<p t="2964780" d="4800">The reason is feminine is very difficult to explainand I don&#39;t think Ihave the time  unfortunately</p>
<p t="2969580" d="2760">But you have to take my word for it</p>
<p t="2972340" d="3340">You see the little cartoon of Robert Crumb after a left there?</p>
<p t="2975700" d="1920">Hi&#39;s got a big Oedpal problem</p>
<p t="2977960" d="800">Old Rob Crumb</p>
<p t="2978760" d="2500">And the problem with him fundamentaly is</p>
<p t="2981260" d="4820">That his mother was something like a gigant spider and did everything what she possibly could to cross the  life out of him</p>
<p t="2986140" d="2700">Hence his remining relationship with women</p>
<p t="2989140" d="3440">And so thats partly the reason why femininity can be</p>
<p t="2994600" d="2480">Something that&#39;s turnes you to stone</p>
<p t="2997080" d="2320">It&#39;s an experiemce that many man are familiar with  by the way</p>
<p t="2999400" d="4220">Because the average man is rejected far more often then he is accepted</p>
<p t="3003620" d="3060">And since women are the gateway to reproduction</p>
<p t="3007000" d="2680">They constitute nature itself</p>
<p t="3009880" d="2160">And nature itself tells most man</p>
<p t="3012040" d="2080">That you should go home and stay under your bed</p>
<p t="3016240" d="3320">There is lots of experiments done about this so for example</p>
<p t="3019560" d="3160">Psychologists have undergraduated woman go out into the concours</p>
<p t="3022720" d="4000">And see how long it takes someone - her to find someone to agree to sleep with her</p>
<p t="3026960" d="1920">And that takes , you know</p>
<p t="3029740" d="2900">Two seconds after she asks the first man</p>
<p t="3032860" d="560">And then</p>
<p t="3034340" d="1440">And then they flip it!</p>
<p t="3035780" d="2960">You know, and they get randome undergraduate guy to do the same things</p>
<p t="3038740" d="2480">and you can imagine the consequences of that</p>
<p t="3041220" d="2660">Since many of you man have lived through it</p>
<p t="3046020" d="1120">Mother nature</p>
<p t="3047860" d="2860">Well, the woman weares the face of Mother Nature</p>
<p t="3050900" d="2060">And the face is generaly rejecting</p>
<p t="3052960" d="2680">Especialy the man who are lower on the dominance hierarchy by the way</p>
<p t="3055640" d="2800">Which is one of the things that irritates guys like Elliot Rogers</p>
<p t="3058440" d="2600">And one of the things that motivates  their desire to take revenge</p>
<p t="3061040" d="1920">That&#39;s the universal phenomena</p>
<p t="3063420" d="2160">So that&#39;s part of the reason that</p>
<p t="3065580" d="3940">The feminine is nature and why nature by the way is Mother Nature</p>
<p t="3069840" d="640">It&#39;s like</p>
<p t="3070840" d="3200">It&#39;s diagnosis of your status is not good enough</p>
<p t="3074100" d="880">And no wonder</p>
<p t="3078800" d="2800">What seams to have happend fundamentally</p>
<p t="3081940" d="2780">Is that this domains that  I talked to you about</p>
<p t="3084720" d="2640">Which can be represented as Chaos and Order</p>
<p t="3087360" d="6000">We say in our, fom the Daoist&#39;s perspective, can also be represented as musculine and feminin</p>
<p t="3093720" d="2320">And I think the reason for it is that</p>
<p t="3096880" d="3320">Human beings their fundamentally social primates, right?</p>
<p t="3100200" d="1120">We&#39;re very very social</p>
<p t="3101660" d="5120">And we know that one of the corelates of brain size in primates is social group size</p>
<p t="3107020" d="4260">And we also know that  the most primates, say chimps who we are quite closely related to</p>
<p t="3111280" d="3580">They don&#39;t like go out and invenstigate  leaves and you know pear at things through the microscope</p>
<p t="3114860" d="3180">they spend all their time interacting with other chimpanzies</p>
<p t="3118040" d="4400">Although they chewing all the time , they have to do it because they have a rediculously inefective</p>
<p t="3122440" d="2300">You know, digestive and eating system</p>
<p t="3128460" d="1520">Their brain is adapted</p>
<p t="3130460" d="4100">To the social circumstances as the primary reality so you could say</p>
<p t="3134560" d="6260">Well tribe is the primary reality and there is the secondary reality which is all that wich is outside tribe</p>
<p t="3140820" d="2580">And that&#39;s corresponds to Chaos and Order</p>
<p t="3145780" d="5340">Order in contradiction to Chaos is symbolised by masculine symbols</p>
<p t="3151160" d="4080">And that&#39;s for example why ideologies like radical feminism</p>
<p t="3155240" d="2840">Presume  the existence of a patriarchy</p>
<p t="3158080" d="2300">It fits in to a symbolic structure of our minds that idea</p>
<p t="3160420" d="2700">And it is true in some sense because</p>
<p t="3163300" d="4280">Just like a chimpanzie troups, the proper primary or metahierarchy</p>
<p t="3167580" d="4800">That makes up human civilization is fundamentaly masculine in its origin  and structure</p>
<p t="3172380" d="3420">And so, masculine is fundamentaly the dominance hierarchy</p>
<p t="3175800" d="2455">And feminine is fundamentally all the things</p>
<p t="3178260" d="3120">That are outside or the chalenge the dominance hierarchy</p>
<p t="3181620" d="2480">And so, it is the perfectly reasonable...its wierd...</p>
<p t="3184180" d="3460">Because our brain is organised to</p>
<p t="3187780" d="3600">Fundamentaly aprechend world in terms of the personalities</p>
<p t="3191380" d="1680">And that&#39;s partly because , you know</p>
<p t="3193060" d="2720">As we emerged of over the course of evolution</p>
<p t="3195780" d="4300">It&#39;s been relatively constant that there are males around and the there were females around</p>
<p t="3200080" d="3500">And then the males were fathers and the females were mothers</p>
<p t="3203700" d="2800">And , you know , they were both mates as well</p>
<p t="3206500" d="2240">That&#39;s the constant of the evolutionary landscape</p>
<p t="3208740" d="1920">And that&#39;s what our brain evolved to process</p>
<p t="3210660" d="5900">And then what happened when we develop the capacity to abstruct is we use this underlying</p>
<p t="3216600" d="7000">Social cognitive abstraction  structure to start to represent the structure of being itself</p>
<p t="3223600" d="3900">so we can say: &quot;Well, there is dominance hierarchy and that&#39;s society</p>
<p t="3227500" d="3480">And that&#39;s masculine and there is all the things that challenge the dominance hierarchy</p>
<p t="3230980" d="2120">And they&#39;re outside and they are feminine</p>
<p t="3233220" d="2560">The weirdest thing about that however</p>
<p t="3235800" d="1680">Is that it actually works</p>
<p t="3237480" d="4800">You know, we&#39;ve got away with that for some reason which seams to be practicaly reasinable</p>
<p t="3242280" d="1940">To map the world in that manner</p>
<p t="3244520" d="1120">It keeps us going</p>
<p t="3257520" d="1900">All right, I&#39;m gonna try to explain this</p>
<p t="3259480" d="2040">This is now chemical symbol</p>
<p t="3264860" d="1840">At the bottom of this symbol</p>
<p t="3266720" d="2400">There is this round thing with wings</p>
<p t="3270300" d="1920">Do you ever see Harry Potter ?</p>
<p t="3272900" d="500">Ye...</p>
<p t="3273520" d="2000">You know the game &quot;Quidditch&quot;</p>
<p t="3275800" d="2000">You remember what they chase?</p>
<p t="3277800" d="1860">They chase the gold one of those</p>
<p t="3280280" d="1120">All right, so...</p>
<p t="3281400" d="1820">They call that the snitch I believe</p>
<p t="3283220" d="1760">And there is a little fragment of soul in</p>
<p t="3284980" d="1900">It&#39;s very interesting idea because</p>
<p t="3286920" d="3600">For the alchemists the primary element of reality</p>
<p t="3290560" d="3000">Whatever that was could be conceptualised as this thing</p>
<p t="3293580" d="1120">This round Chaos</p>
<p t="3294840" d="2960">And what is was conceptualised of, in part, was</p>
<p t="3297800" d="4080">It was a container from which matter and spirit could emerge</p>
<p t="3301880" d="2480">And you might ask &quot;What does that mean?&quot;</p>
<p t="3305140" d="1440">This is what it means:</p>
<p t="3310240" d="3120">When a child experiences something it can&#39;t predict</p>
<p t="3314000" d="2160">It does the thing that led to that</p>
<p t="3316700" d="1280">Uncertain outcome</p>
<p t="3317980" d="1440">Over and over and over and over</p>
<p t="3319520" d="1400">Until it can map it</p>
<p t="3321240" d="2020">And than you think &quot;What will the child do?&quot;</p>
<p t="3323260" d="4480">What the child did was take the domain of that which it did not understand</p>
<p t="3327860" d="5540">And it transformed it into matter, which is the predictable world of entities and spirit</p>
<p t="3333400" d="3780">Which is the internal pssychological structure that is adapted to that</p>
<p t="3337180" d="3460">And so, whats the alchemists basically conceptualised was that</p>
<p t="3343380" d="4260">What exists outside of your conceptual framework is something like</p>
<p t="3348020" d="1520">Unrealised potential</p>
<p t="3349540" d="4220">And when you interact with that unrealised potential you actualise it</p>
<p t="3353760" d="1960">And you actualise it in to two component elements</p>
<p t="3355720" d="2800">One being:the material world and the other being</p>
<p t="3358580" d="1540">You own psychological structure</p>
<p t="3360220" d="3360">That&#39;s why they conceptualised matter and spirit</p>
<p t="3363580" d="3200">The container of matter and spirit as the ultimate reality</p>
<p t="3366780" d="2640">And out all of that emerged something that was quite primodial</p>
<p t="3369420" d="880">Which is the dragon</p>
<p t="3371100" d="500">Now...</p>
<p t="3372960" d="1600">One of the things we know</p>
<p t="3375940" d="1840">Remember the Genesis story?</p>
<p t="3379760" d="2760">It&#39;s the snake that gives people vision</p>
<p t="3382680" d="780">Remember that?</p>
<p t="3384100" d="3500">It gives them wisdom and also produces self-consciousness</p>
<p t="3390280" d="2780">There is women named Lynne Isbell, who is the anthropologist in LA</p>
<p t="3393060" d="2360">And she was very interested in human being&#39;s  sight</p>
<p t="3395420" d="1080">Because we can realy see</p>
<p t="3396500" d="3400">We can see better than any other creature, exept predatory birds</p>
<p t="3399900" d="2520">We can see way better than most primates</p>
<p t="3404620" d="3900">Is thou  new that our tree dwelling ancestors, some 60 million years ago</p>
<p t="3408620" d="2480">Emerged at about the same time as snakes</p>
<p t="3411100" d="1340">Thery&#39;re younger...</p>
<p t="3412440" d="1480">than lizards, by the way</p>
<p t="3413920" d="4420">And than we were preyed on quite intensely by snakes for tens of millions of years</p>
<p t="3418340" d="3920">She also knew that we were good at detecting snakes at the bottom of our visual field</p>
<p t="3422260" d="1920">And that we were particulary good at detecting</p>
<p t="3424180" d="3580">The camouflage patternes of snakes at the bottom of our visual field</p>
<p t="3427760" d="2960">So, she did a series of field experiments showing that</p>
<p t="3430900" d="1820">Primate visual acuity was</p>
<p t="3433060" d="4360">Correlated strongly with the presence of preditory snakes in the immediate enviroment</p>
<p t="3438280" d="660">So...</p>
<p t="3439460" d="2080">The idea that snakes gave us vision</p>
<p t="3441720" d="760">Is right !</p>
<p t="3442480" d="2040">Now, why is that relevant to this?</p>
<p t="3446440" d="3800">We were prey upon for a very long period of time and we developed</p>
<p t="3450240" d="2280">A neural circuit to deal with predators</p>
<p t="3452520" d="3980">And that&#39;s the neural circuit that is activated in children ... when they are terrified</p>
<p t="3456500" d="1580">About monsters at night</p>
<p t="3458980" d="500">So...</p>
<p t="3460740" d="1340">The predator entity</p>
<p t="3462080" d="1320">Which is this dragon</p>
<p t="3463500" d="3340">It&#39;s like a ...like amalgam of the predatory forces</p>
<p t="3467280" d="4940">Is one of the manifestations of the things that exist outside of the dominance hierarchy</p>
<p t="3472220" d="2640">So, it&#39;s a ...it&#39;s a form of primodial reality</p>
<p t="3474860" d="2960">It&#39;s not abstract any more, like the matter and spirit container</p>
<p t="3477820" d="4800">It&#39;s like the first practical manifestation of what&#39;s terrifying and treatning</p>
<p t="3482620" d="1580">Concretly  outside that</p>
<p t="3484440" d="560">And so..</p>
<p t="3485120" d="880">Remember ...</p>
<p t="3486640" d="2180">Animals can respond to treat</p>
<p t="3488820" d="3180">But they can&#39;t conceptualise treat as a category</p>
<p t="3492000" d="3400">That&#39;s the conceptualsation of treat as a category</p>
<p t="3495440" d="1920">It emerges absolute unknown</p>
<p t="3497360" d="1760">It manifest itself as treat</p>
<p t="3499160" d="1280">So, for example ...</p>
<p t="3500600" d="4000">If you hear a loud noise behind you or a growl when you&#39;re in the forest</p>
<p t="3504600" d="2980">The first thing that happends is you don&#39;t know what&#39;s going on</p>
<p t="3507580" d="3100">And that&#39;s initial states of contact with potential</p>
<p t="3510680" d="1680">And then when you turn around</p>
<p t="3512360" d="4020">And you look that potential manifest itself in to something that predatory</p>
<p t="3516380" d="1500">And you have a circuit for that!</p>
<p t="3517880" d="5360">And that&#39;s the same circuit that we now use to assess anything unexpected that occurs to us</p>
<p t="3523240" d="2500">And like that circuit have to come from somewhere</p>
<p t="3525740" d="3380">And so, our capacity to respond to surprising entities</p>
<p t="3529160" d="6600">Is elaboration and elaboration up into abstraction of our capacity to identify predators</p>
<p t="3536140" d="2320">So that&#39;s the next level of reality</p>
<p t="3538560" d="1520">And out of that</p>
<p t="3540480" d="4320">Chaotic circumstance, comes something that&#39;s more human, and...</p>
<p t="3545380" d="2560">...That is the emergence of</p>
<p t="3547940" d="4100">Masculinity and femininity, and out of that, more primodial element</p>
<p t="3568600" d="1180">Let me show you</p>
<p t="3570360" d="820">Two things</p>
<p t="3574680" d="1460">This is a map of ...</p>
<p t="3577620" d="1600">...pragmatic teritory</p>
<p t="3579420" d="1200">As far as I can tell</p>
<p t="3580620" d="2560">Is the teritory that people actually inhabit</p>
<p t="3583960" d="4500">At the first level , thats the square, I call that The Dragon of Chaos</p>
<p t="3589260" d="1900">That&#39;s the unknown as such</p>
<p t="3592220" d="4180">And it&#39;s the thing that you fall in to when your conseptual schemes fall epart</p>
<p t="3597440" d="2320">What manifest itself out of that is...</p>
<p t="3601760" d="800">Femininity</p>
<p t="3602680" d="1840">And femininity comes in two forms</p>
<p t="3604580" d="2000">One is benevolent femininity</p>
<p t="3607300" d="1460">Example would be</p>
<p t="3609460" d="660">This</p>
<p t="3611920" d="2380">You see Mary on the left there</p>
<p t="3614300" d="2000">She is in the structure called a Meandorla</p>
<p t="3616300" d="2920">Which is from a freudian perspective</p>
<p t="3619380" d="960">Has obvious</p>
<p t="3620960" d="1360">Sexual conotations</p>
<p t="3622380" d="3760">You see, if you look carefuly, that she&#39;s standing on the reptile</p>
<p t="3626280" d="2240">and holding her child away from it</p>
<p t="3629080" d="2560">It&#39;s a comon midieval christian image</p>
<p t="3631640" d="3320">And you can think of it as divine because woman spent an awful lot of time doing that</p>
<p t="3634960" d="3160">with their children over the course of our milions of years of evolution</p>
<p t="3638120" d="3780">And it&#39;s something that&#39;s sacred because our species depended on that</p>
<p t="3642520" d="1920">For its...for its survival!</p>
<p t="3644680" d="1280">This is even better</p>
<p t="3645960" d="2180">This is the medieval image, I love this image</p>
<p t="3648140" d="4640">So there is Mary with the Christ child and she is standing again on a reptile</p>
<p t="3652780" d="1360">A predatory reptile</p>
<p t="3654140" d="2240">But in the background you see all those weird little shapes?</p>
<p t="3657280" d="2080">Those are musical instruments</p>
<p t="3659360" d="1880">And there they fill the space</p>
<p t="3661240" d="2960">And the medivialartist who drew this picture</p>
<p t="3664220" d="1460">Had this intimation</p>
<p t="3665980" d="560">That...</p>
<p t="3667320" d="4040">Behind the manifestation of something as primary as...</p>
<p t="3671860" d="3340">The protective maternality of Mary was...</p>
<p t="3675200" d="5140">Something like the music of the spheres or a colection of harmonious patterns</p>
<p t="3680340" d="5920">And at this figure was constantly emerging out of that background of harmonious patterns</p>
<p t="3686480" d="3260">Across the infinite stretches of time itself!</p>
<p t="3690180" d="720">That&#39;s...</p>
<p t="3690900" d="5100">It&#39;s a sacred image because it represent something that human society can not live without!</p>
<p t="3696400" d="4240">It&#39;s like...Any society that doesn&#39;t regard the Virgin and the Child</p>
<p t="3700640" d="2720">Who protects the child from the predatory serpent</p>
<p t="3703360" d="2940">Has prime element of sacred reality</p>
<p t="3706320" d="1840">Is going to make itself extinct!</p>
<p t="3708160" d="2460">You know ...I could say for example</p>
<p t="3710680" d="3900">That that&#39;s what happening to the endogenous population of Eastern Europe at the moment</p>
<p t="3714720" d="2620">where the birth rate is far below replacement</p>
<p t="3720680" d="2160">I&#39;m gonna show you another image</p>
<p t="3723580" d="3940">This is called the (................) or &quot;open Virgin &quot;</p>
<p t="3727520" d="2400">And this was a common representation in...</p>
<p t="3729920" d="2380">Midieval Europe , and it&#39;s weird representation</p>
<p t="3732300" d="1520">From a christian perspective</p>
<p t="3733820" d="3060">Because its , kind of, reverses that normal hierarchy of power</p>
<p t="3737500" d="1360">What you have here is</p>
<p t="3739080" d="780">Mary</p>
<p t="3739860" d="2500">She&#39;s holding the Christ child when the statue is closed</p>
<p t="3742360" d="1440">And then you open her up</p>
<p t="3744520" d="2720">What you see inside Mary is God the Father</p>
<p t="3747460" d="1920">And God the Father is holding</p>
<p t="3749560" d="700">Christ</p>
<p t="3750400" d="1040">In his hands</p>
<p t="3751520" d="740">Now....</p>
<p t="3754460" d="4080">Mary constitutes the super ordinate benevolence permanent</p>
<p t="3758640" d="2560">Inside her is the structure of culture</p>
<p t="3761380" d="3680">So you can think: inside nature is the structure of culture</p>
<p t="3765060" d="2120">And that&#39;s represented in this image by God</p>
<p t="3767180" d="2620">Because he is the ultimate Father, obviously</p>
<p t="3769800" d="1100">In christian thinking, and than</p>
<p t="3771440" d="2080">The God figure is holding what?</p>
<p t="3773760" d="1520">Crusified individual</p>
<p t="3775900" d="1200">What is that mean?</p>
<p t="3777440" d="500">Now...</p>
<p t="3777940" d="2540">All the people around there: kings, queens, commoners</p>
<p t="3780480" d="2380">Are all gazing at that central figure</p>
<p t="3782860" d="2020">Which of course is fundamentally what</p>
<p t="3784880" d="3900">Everyone in western civilisations has been doing for two thousand years</p>
<p t="3788980" d="1460">Not knowing why!</p>
<p t="3792700" d="2160">Nature gives rise to the culture</p>
<p t="3794920" d="1960">Culture gives rise</p>
<p t="3796880" d="1900">to the suffering individual</p>
<p t="3799240" d="1440">O! That&#39;s true enough</p>
<p t="3801440" d="1520">It&#39;s true for every one</p>
<p t="3802960" d="2720">It&#39;s true for life every point in time</p>
<p t="3805680" d="2780">But there is more to the image of the crucifiction</p>
<p t="3808460" d="2980">Because the crucifiction also represents</p>
<p t="3811740" d="2540">Voluntarily acceptance of suffering</p>
<p t="3814400" d="2480">And volutarily acceptance of death</p>
<p t="3816880" d="4600">And it also points to something else that&#39;s a paramount importance which is that</p>
<p t="3822340" d="3020">There is an element of the human psyche that can die</p>
<p t="3825380" d="920">And Come back!</p>
<p t="3826300" d="3000">And die and come back and that&#39;s what happends to you</p>
<p t="3829560" d="2380">When you encounter a catastrophy</p>
<p t="3831940" d="4080">And you make horror of it, and you climb back out of the underworld</p>
<p t="3836020" d="3920">And you...your vojage through life is punctuated by trips to the underworld</p>
<p t="3839940" d="4120">And so, you are somwhere and then you go outside of that and then you go somewhere else</p>
<p t="3844060" d="1160">and you go outside that</p>
<p t="3845220" d="4900">And so what happends to people is they generaly identify with where they are</p>
<p t="3850580" d="620">Order</p>
<p t="3851900" d="2480">But Order just dissolve and colapses</p>
<p t="3854380" d="1420">and then reconstitutes itself</p>
<p t="3855800" d="940">so then you might say</p>
<p t="3856740" d="3640">&quot;If you are trying to adapt to the structure of reality itself</p>
<p t="3860580" d="2520">instead of identifying with Order</p>
<p t="3863240" d="4280">You would identify with the process that allowed you to transform yourself</p>
<p t="3867520" d="3380">Across repeated bouts or Order and Chaos</p>
<p t="3871180" d="3840">And thats what this sort of images are trying to represent</p>
<p t="3878240" d="960">Let me show you</p>
<p t="3881500" d="1540">One final idea</p>
<p t="3889940" d="2640">There is the Dao&#39;s idea that is like this</p>
<p t="3892580" d="3020">So the Dao&#39;s symbol, you know the Dao&#39;s symbol?</p>
<p t="3895600" d="1940">I already talked to you about it, you,ve all seen it</p>
<p t="3897720" d="1040">Chaos and Order</p>
<p t="3899180" d="1600">Masculine and feminine</p>
<p t="3901380" d="1300">Constantly</p>
<p t="3903180" d="1160">In inter play</p>
<p t="3904420" d="500">That&#39;s</p>
<p t="3905580" d="500">Dao!</p>
<p t="3906080" d="1620">From the daoist perpective</p>
<p t="3907800" d="1840">and Dao is the source of meaning</p>
<p t="3909640" d="4500">So the idea that there is the constant interplay between chaos and order</p>
<p t="3914140" d="2720">that produces the sense of meaning in human beings</p>
<p t="3916920" d="980">And that&#39;s true!</p>
<p t="3918980" d="2460">That is what produces the sense of meaning</p>
<p t="3921440" d="4020">You know that because when you engage in a compeling operation</p>
<p t="3925460" d="4540">you&#39;re partly ordered than secured and you have one foot out into the unknown</p>
<p t="3930000" d="1180">And the balance is proper</p>
<p t="3931180" d="2560">And as a consequence you&#39;re engaged in what you&#39;re doing</p>
<p t="3933740" d="3080">And as  consequence of that you loose yourself consciousness</p>
<p t="3936940" d="3200">And if you stay engaged in that sort of situation</p>
<p t="3940140" d="4040">On a continual basis then you find that your life is meaningfuland rich</p>
<p t="3944180" d="4640">And that is the best antidote to the fact that life is bounded and full of suffering</p>
<p t="3949040" d="500">Now...</p>
<p t="3950080" d="2640">Dao means meaning and also means jurney</p>
<p t="3953060" d="3960">And the center of the Dao is the place  you&#39;re suppose to be</p>
<p t="3957240" d="2480">One foot in chaos and one foot in order</p>
<p t="3960400" d="4080">And thats the best place to be in the actual enviroment itself</p>
<p t="3964480" d="3960">because the actual enviroment is better construde than the constant danger play</p>
<p t="3968440" d="4340">between chaos and order than it is construde as a colection of the material objects</p>
<p t="3973100" d="2320">And if you adopt the pragmatic view</p>
<p t="3975600" d="1360">that points out that</p>
<p t="3977140" d="4440">There are metarealities above the miere objects that we percieve</p>
<p t="3981580" d="2820">You can also apprehend that our brains are actualy adapted</p>
<p t="3984400" d="2480">To the metarealities and not the realities</p>
<p t="3986920" d="1480">Because our brains are like</p>
<p t="3988540" d="2120">3 hundred million years old</p>
<p t="3990800" d="3920">And what we&#39;ve done is abstracted out those things that are constant across</p>
<p t="3995060" d="1040">strands of times</p>
<p t="3996100" d="3780">Strand of times that are hundred millions years in lenght</p>
<p t="4000200" d="2960">and those are&#39;nt chairs and tables or automobiles</p>
<p t="4003160" d="4160">They are metastructures that are much more sophisticated than that</p>
<p t="4007320" d="4500">and we ignore that at our perilbecause modern people don&#39;t believe  that meaning exist</p>
<p t="4011820" d="1300">They think it&#39;s myth</p>
<p t="4013120" d="700">Epiphenomal</p>
<p t="4013820" d="2860">There is nothing subjective about our world view</p>
<p t="4016700" d="2760">where in fact our nervous systems are tuned</p>
<p t="4019800" d="4400">so that life is manifesting itself in the most meaningful possible way</p>
<p t="4024200" d="4320">when you happend to be occuping the precise position between chaos and order</p>
<p t="4028680" d="2580">that maximases your  security</p>
<p t="4031260" d="3220">and the developement of that security across time</p>
<p t="4034920" d="960">and that&#39;s not</p>
<p t="4037640" d="6160">that&#39;s the most realthing there  is and to stay in that positionis also to accept voluntarily</p>
<p t="4043800" d="2440">the necessity for a certain degree of suffering</p>
<p t="4046540" d="2480">because as you extend your capacitys</p>
<p t="4049100" d="3760">by exposing yourself to the optimal level of the unknown</p>
<p t="4052860" d="4160">You&#39;re constantly taking yourself apart and rebuilding yourself</p>
<p t="4057100" d="4320">and that&#39;s what allows you to trive not only in the present self stability</p>
<p t="4061500" d="2160">But also in a state that consists</p>
<p t="4063660" d="2140">of the transformation of that stability</p>
<p t="4076820" d="3120">Here is the representation from ancient Egypt</p>
<p t="4080560" d="3300">Thise are the representations of Horus</p>
<p t="4083860" d="6220">There is a lot of evidence that many of the ideas we have about Christ are derivative of Egyptian ideas</p>
<p t="4090660" d="1900">Most people who point that out</p>
<p t="4094060" d="4400">point it out in the manner that, saying that&#39;s devaluing the ideas that we&#39;re derive from Egipt</p>
<p t="4098840" d="2400">Because they have a priority motive</p>
<p t="4101240" d="1620">Which is the distractive motive</p>
<p t="4104540" d="4080">As mitology progreses across the centuries its transforms itself</p>
<p t="4108620" d="3760">And it tends to continually encapsulate, re-encapsulate</p>
<p t="4112380" d="6060">The primary ideas that the human race is managed to produce  both the structure and reality itself</p>
<p t="4118440" d="2500">There are constantcies across this cultural</p>
<p t="4121460" d="5120">manifestations because the reality to which they referes actually reality</p>
<p t="4127620" d="660">Horus</p>
<p t="4128720" d="3280">This is the good lesson and I leave you with this</p>
<p t="4132180" d="1340">Horus is the eye</p>
<p t="4135180" d="2200">The eye is not the intelect!</p>
<p t="4137680" d="5520">The intelect is the thing that forces everything into the pre-existing structure</p>
<p t="4143680" d="2240">And it crunches reality to do that</p>
<p t="4145920" d="1520">It works it and twists it</p>
<p t="4147440" d="2660">And it makes people ideological and rigid</p>
<p t="4150100" d="2480">The eye is something comletely different</p>
<p t="4153220" d="2640">The eye is the thing that pays attention</p>
<p t="4155860" d="2400">And your attention is automaticaly directed</p>
<p t="4158260" d="2620">To those elements of your experiencial field</p>
<p t="4160880" d="3340">When the most information it&#39;s manifesting itself</p>
<p t="4164220" d="2300">That&#39;s why for example if you&#39;re talking to someone in the bar</p>
<p t="4166520" d="3440">And there&#39;s TV flickering you can&#39;t help butlook at the TV</p>
<p t="4169960" d="4340">The change, the transformation is what your nervous system is atuned to</p>
<p t="4174400" d="3280">And the teory is that if you are a follower of Horus</p>
<p t="4177680" d="4580">Who&#39;s the eye and the falcon, because falcons can see and they fly above everything else</p>
<p t="4182260" d="2820">If you are a follower of Horus you pay attention</p>
<p t="4185080" d="2480">When you pay attention you absorbe information</p>
<p t="4187660" d="3040">when you absorb information you continually</p>
<p t="4191600" d="1360">Transform yourself</p>
<p t="4192960" d="3180">And that keeps you on top of that ever shifting reality</p>
<p t="4196660" d="1460">Doing that is meanningful</p>
<p t="4198120" d="3060">And that&#39;s what stops you from becoming bitter and cruel</p>
<p t="4201180" d="2580">Because, you know, life is suffering</p>
<p t="4203760" d="3100">And if you don&#39;t have an antidote to that suffering that&#39;s real</p>
<p t="4206860" d="3100">Then you become resentful about the structure of experience</p>
<p t="4209960" d="2780">And then you do everything you can to take revenge on it</p>
<p t="4213400" d="4640">And we saw what happened when people get that in the  twentieth century</p>
<p t="4218040" d="3340">And it would be a good thing if people won&#39;t happend stop doing it</p>
<p t="4221880" d="3360">And as far as I can tell after trying to figure this out for, like ...</p>
<p t="4225760" d="1040">thirty years</p>
<p t="4227220" d="1740">The way that you do that</p>
<p t="4229160" d="2140">Is by paying attention</p>
<p t="4231300" d="2860">And transforming yourself when it&#39;s neccesary</p>
<p t="4234620" d="2560">And stoping the proces of identifying</p>
<p t="4237180" d="1860">With what you already believe</p>
<p t="4239040" d="1980">who the hell cares what you believe ?</p>
<p t="4241020" d="2840">You should be attending to the things you don&#39;t know</p>
<p t="4244000" d="3440">Which is a much larger space than the things you know</p>
<p t="4247440" d="3880">And then you should be construing yourself not as the inhabitant</p>
<p t="4251320" d="3120">of a sterile and static, and already completed</p>
<p t="4255140" d="720">structure</p>
<p t="4255860" d="2140">But as the thing that lives on the edge of that</p>
<p t="4258000" d="2600">That&#39;s constantly building and re-building it</p>
<p t="4261060" d="3280">and then if something happends to your structure</p>
<p t="4264340" d="3100">it&#39;s not so relevant because thats not what you are!</p>
<p t="4267440" d="3780">you are the thing that can engage in transformation of structure</p>
<p t="4271440" d="1360">by paying attention</p>
<p t="4275880" d="2960">and that&#39;s what thise representations mean</p>
<p t="4284540" d="3520">this are Renaissance pictures , you know, they elevated</p>
<p t="4288440" d="4460">the entity that voluntarily accepted the necessity of suffering and  death</p>
<p t="4292900" d="1780">So that&#39;s represented by Christ</p>
<p t="4295140" d="3360">to the highest position in the heavenly hierarchy</p>
<p t="4303900" d="4900">what that idea means is that what should constitute the transcended value</p>
<p t="4308800" d="2540">that sits above all other values</p>
<p t="4316080" d="6080">is your capacity to voluntarily accept the restricted and painful conditions of your life</p>
<p t="4322220" d="1460">to face them</p>
<p t="4323680" d="4280">And as a consequence of facing them immediately transcend them</p>
<p t="4327960" d="2900">and one of the things we know from clinical psychology</p>
<p t="4330860" d="2520">is that if you have someone who is afraid</p>
<p t="4334240" d="1280">they aviod</p>
<p t="4336020" d="1800">so what do you do about that?</p>
<p t="4337820" d="2840">you brake down the things they are afraid of</p>
<p t="4340660" d="2700">till you find the small unit that they can approach</p>
<p t="4343920" d="3840">When they approach it they learn that they can approach it</p>
<p t="4347760" d="1920">and that they&#39;re more than they thought they were</p>
<p t="4349720" d="2400">and they can approach the next thing</p>
<p t="4352120" d="5440">and than the next thing so you take a women whos got agarophobia who can&#39;t get into an elevator</p>
<p t="4357560" d="6160">and week later she can and then she goes home and has the fight with her husband that she should had twenty years ago</p>
<p t="4363720" d="4040">adn the reason for that is that when she is exposed to the things that she&#39;s afraid of</p>
<p t="4367760" d="1420">insted of running from them</p>
<p t="4369200" d="4960">she learns that she is the thing that can be exposed to thing she&#39;s afraid of</p>
<p t="4374160" d="2420">she doesn&#39;t learn that things aren&#39;t frightning</p>
<p t="4376580" d="5120">and learning the  thing  she&#39;s is the thing that can be exposed to things that are frightning</p>
<p t="4381700" d="2620">makes her more than the  frightning things</p>
<p t="4384320" d="4860">and is certenely possible that we &#39;re more than the things that frightened us</p>
<p t="4389180" d="2240">if we weren&#39;t we wouldn&#39;t be here</p>
<p t="4405040" d="4160">we shouldn&#39;t throw this things away before we understand them</p>
<p t="4409240" d="2760">and we&#39;re in danger of doing that now</p>
<p t="4413660" d="4040">so part what I was trying to do with my lecture and my work is to poin out</p>
<p t="4418200" d="800">what our...</p>
<p t="4419320" d="1200">forefathers knew</p>
<p t="4422140" d="6160">to try to help modern people understand it and to make pace that this things that we think of as</p>
<p t="4433360" d="6660">non-real representations are more real then enything that we currently comprehend as a real</p>
<p t="4443080" d="3420">that consequences of not comprehending them</p>
<p t="4448060" d="2880">And living by them as far as I can tell is that</p>
<p t="4451320" d="1360">things deteriorate</p>
<p t="4453780" d="2700">And they can deteriorate to the point</p>
<p t="4456880" d="3120">Where everything is intolerable for everyone</p>
<p t="4460240" d="1520">and that&#39;s seams to be</p>
<p t="4462420" d="2260">suboptimal destination</p>
<p t="4466700" d="740">so...</p>
<p t="4468000" d="1760">thanks for the invitation</p>
