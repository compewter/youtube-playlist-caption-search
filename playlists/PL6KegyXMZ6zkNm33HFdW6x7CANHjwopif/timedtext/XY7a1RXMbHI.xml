<p t="5310" d="8350">Okay, so, now we are going to talk about the
phenomenological, existential/phenomenological</p>
<p t="13660" d="6570">psychiatrists and their theories from the
1950s, and, as I mentioned to you before,</p>
<p t="20230" d="4990">a lot of their thinking was motivated by what
had happened in World War II.</p>
<p t="25220" d="7289">When I lectured to you last, I pointed out,
I described Nietzsche and Dostoevsky’s summation</p>
<p t="32509" d="3541">of the world’s situation and really the
world’s psychological situation at the end</p>
<p t="36050" d="6090">of the 1800s and that was that, our new modes
of thinking had undermined our faith, and</p>
<p t="42140" d="3980">our old modes of thinking –and that was
a problem, because people need something to</p>
<p t="46120" d="4960">stand on and orient themselves and to move
forward – so Nietzsche and Dostoevsky basically</p>
<p t="51080" d="5580">both prophesied that the consequence of that
disillusion would be, increased probability</p>
<p t="56660" d="2370">of nihilism, and everything that went along
with that.</p>
<p t="59030" d="4590">And Dostoevsky wrote about that actually quite
extensively in a book called “Notes from</p>
<p t="63620" d="3569">Underground,” which, if many of you are
interested, especially in clinical psychology,</p>
<p t="67189" d="4610">this is a book you should really read, because
this is one of the most brilliant psychological</p>
<p t="71799" d="5651">studies of a psychologically disturbed man
that has ever been written.</p>
<p t="77450" d="3250">It is very accurate, and there are sections
in “Crime and Punishment” that are like</p>
<p t="80700" d="1000">that too.</p>
<p t="81700" d="6390">I think they are unsurpassed in their representation
of psychological phenomena.</p>
<p t="88090" d="5590">I don’t know how he managed it – I mean,
Dostoevsky was epileptic, I don’t know if</p>
<p t="93680" d="6829">you know that, but he was arrested by the
Tsar’s men in late 1800s for being a student</p>
<p t="100509" d="8231">radical and they threw him in prison in Moscow,
and then, one day, they took Mao in front</p>
<p t="108740" d="3760">of a firing squad and shot him at 6 in the
morning, but they only used blanks, which,</p>
<p t="112500" d="1939">of course, he didn’t know about.</p>
<p t="114439" d="5930">That scared him so badly, he developed epilepsy
– that can happen, by the way – then he</p>
<p t="120369" d="4240">had the epilepsy for the rest of his life,
but he had this strange kind of epilepsy,</p>
<p t="124609" d="5111">which actually not all that rare, sometimes
when people have epilepsy they experience</p>
<p t="129720" d="3750">this phenomenon they call an aura, which is
an altered state of consciousness before the</p>
<p t="133470" d="3090">epileptic seizure heads, and they can be very
strange, these auras.</p>
<p t="136560" d="7069">I read a case once about a guy who, his aura
was that his hand was being possessed by devils</p>
<p t="143629" d="4631">from hell and he could feel the possession
move up his arm, and into his shoulder, and,</p>
<p t="148260" d="2589">once it hit his head, he’d have an epileptic
seizure.</p>
<p t="150849" d="7761">So there is another case, where this man,
his aura was that exact double had appeared</p>
<p t="158610" d="4820">behind him, but if he turned to look, then
he would have an epileptic seizure, but if</p>
<p t="163430" d="2809">he didn’t turn to look, then he wouldn’t.</p>
<p t="166239" d="5470">These brain disorders are very strange things,
because they’re, well, the system that is</p>
<p t="171709" d="5651">disordered is a lie, and is capable of any
number of extraordinarily peculiar misbehaviours.</p>
<p t="177360" d="6750">Anyways, Dostoevsky’s aura was a world revealing
aura and, so, what Dostoevsky would experience</p>
<p t="184110" d="5440">was that, the meaning of things got deeper,
and deeper, and deeper, and deeper, and deeper,</p>
<p t="189550" d="3439">and, then, just as he was on the verge of
discovering the secret to everything, he would</p>
<p t="192989" d="1700">have an epileptic seizure.</p>
<p t="194689" d="5531">But he said that the quality of experience
during the aura was so high, so overpowering,</p>
<p t="200220" d="4760">and so deep, that he would have traded all
of his normal experience just to have had</p>
<p t="204980" d="2410">those experiences, and he had them repeatedly.</p>
<p t="207390" d="7260">I really do believe that it was this broadening
of his vision and concept by his epilepsy</p>
<p t="214650" d="2149">that transformed him, among other things.</p>
<p t="216799" d="4201">He went through some pretty damn rough experiences
because he was in prison with rapists and</p>
<p t="221000" d="5489">murderers for a long time in Siberia, even
though he was kind of an aristocratic guy.</p>
<p t="226489" d="5860">He had a rough time of it, and I imagine that
that also broadened him tremendously, given</p>
<p t="232349" d="5771">that it didn’t kill him, but I really do
believe that the epileptic insight was key</p>
<p t="238120" d="8050">to his unsurpassed genius, and so, his aura
– and other people do experience epileptic</p>
<p t="246170" d="4679">auras, symptoms like that, by the way – and
some people are so enamoured of the aura that</p>
<p t="250849" d="4411">they would not take the antiepileptic medication,
because they don’t want to forgo the experience</p>
<p t="255260" d="4960">that precedes the aura, or the actual epileptic
seizure.</p>
<p t="260220" d="6990">And Dostoevsky’s experiences, they all are
an element of the aura, is also relevant to</p>
<p t="267210" d="5179">what we are going to talk about today, because
both Binswanger and Boss were very interested</p>
<p t="272389" d="3161">in how meaning revealed itself in the world.</p>
<p t="275550" d="3399">And they had opposing explanations.</p>
<p t="278949" d="6280">I actually think they are parallel explanations,
but, the meaning that Dostoevsky experienced</p>
<p t="285229" d="8071">is an amplification of the normal manner in
which meaning reveals itself in the world.</p>
<p t="293300" d="5869">And people experience that sort of thing in
various altered states of consciousness.</p>
<p t="299169" d="5861">Anyways, Binswanger and Boss, they worked
mostly in the 1950s, and as I said, they were</p>
<p t="305030" d="3310">very concerned with what had happened in World
War II.</p>
<p t="308340" d="4950">So Dostoevsky and Nietzsche basically predicted
that it was going to be nihilism, or ideological</p>
<p t="313290" d="6719">totalitarianism, and that is basically exactly
what happened, by the time the 1930s appeared</p>
<p t="320009" d="6351">on the horizon, the Germans had been, they
had gone through an absolutely brutal First</p>
<p t="326360" d="1790">World War.</p>
<p t="328150" d="4000">And then, they went through hyperinflation
of insane proportions.</p>
<p t="332150" d="5680">So, in the 1920s, Germany underwent this partly
because they had such heavy war debts to pay</p>
<p t="337830" d="1670">for World War I.</p>
<p t="339500" d="7139">The German inflation got to the point where
it was literally upwards of a hundred million</p>
<p t="346639" d="2051">Marks to buy a loaf of bread.</p>
<p t="348690" d="4430">So, they were taking wheel barrels full of
money to the grocery store.</p>
<p t="353120" d="5299">What happened was that their currency devalued
to zero, and, that actually happens to economies</p>
<p t="358419" d="1661">more often than you might think.</p>
<p t="360080" d="4940">The thing just hits zero and that is that,
and then it has to be rebooted so to speak.</p>
<p t="365020" d="4890">So, they had been… the war was dreadful
and hundreds of thousands of men were killed</p>
<p t="369910" d="1000">or brutalized.</p>
<p t="370910" d="2700">Then, their economy just absolutely fell apart.</p>
<p t="373610" d="5600">And, then, of course, at the same time – well,
a little bit earlier – the revolution had</p>
<p t="379210" d="4799">taken place in Russia, right at the end of
the First World War, and the communism had</p>
<p t="384009" d="4590">come to power, and the Communists were agitating
all over Europe, and in North America, and</p>
<p t="388599" d="6190">their goal was to produce a Communist revolution
that was worldwide and so, the Germans were</p>
<p t="394789" d="4431">all shorted out that the Communists were going
to take over the country, which was a perfectly</p>
<p t="399220" d="7069">reasonable fear, and, instead of that, what
happened was that Fascism rose, and was a</p>
<p t="406289" d="5451">form of state totalitarianism and I think
the Germans were so desperate for order by</p>
<p t="411740" d="1000">that point.</p>
<p t="412740" d="4510">And that is what the Fascists basically offered
them, at least in theory.</p>
<p t="417250" d="4409">Unfortunately, as it turned out, they offered
them a little bit too much order, or maybe</p>
<p t="421659" d="3121">a lot too much order, and things went dreadfully
south.</p>
<p t="424780" d="6770">So, then, the whole world had to walk through
the horrors of World War II, and it was shocking,</p>
<p t="431550" d="3920">in a variety of ways, not only because of
the brutality of the warfare, but because</p>
<p t="435470" d="4949">of the genocidal actions that took place consciously
by the Nazis.</p>
<p t="440419" d="3891">And those actions were in many ways very difficult
to understand.</p>
<p t="444310" d="5630">I mean, here is why they are particularly
difficult to understand: there were certainly</p>
<p t="449940" d="7729">times where the brutality that the Nazis employed
in their eradication of their theoretical</p>
<p t="457669" d="4900">enemies, far surpassed the necessity for the
mere eradication.</p>
<p t="462569" d="4991">But even worse than that, so it went past
eradication into real torture, constantly,</p>
<p t="467560" d="5110">and, not only that, there are many situations
in which the Nazis, especially near the end</p>
<p t="472670" d="3580">of the war, they had to decide, really, whether
they were going to continue exterminating</p>
<p t="476250" d="4949">Jews and gypsies, and homosexuals, and all
the people they felt didn’t fit into their</p>
<p t="481199" d="2150">culture, or whether they were going to win
the war.</p>
<p t="483349" d="4061">There were decisions they had to make about
the distribution of resources.</p>
<p t="487410" d="4259">If they were going to pursue the homicidal
extermination, that would mean it would decrease</p>
<p t="491669" d="1960">the probability that they would win the war.</p>
<p t="493629" d="4151">And that happened a lot, especially at the
end of the war, the Nazis always continuing</p>
<p t="497780" d="1129">the extermination.</p>
<p t="498909" d="6381">Now, that is pretty damn interesting, because,
you can think, well, on the one hand, if they</p>
<p t="505290" d="5689">are serving a creed and the creed is world
domination, then this is the extermination</p>
<p t="510979" d="6781">processes are considered a step towards the
actual end point, which is the establishment</p>
<p t="517760" d="5260">of a world state, the Fascist world state,
or at least, the Fascist European state, then</p>
<p t="523020" d="5259">you would think that the extermination attempts
would be subordinate to that goal, if they</p>
<p t="528279" d="3351">were actually pursing the goal that they said
they were pursuing.</p>
<p t="531630" d="4740">But there is an old psychoanalytic idea, which
is really worthwhile, it is like a surgical</p>
<p t="536370" d="4130">tool, and I would say, that if you were going
to use it in your own life, use it carefully,</p>
<p t="540500" d="2510">because you don’t want to do unnecessary
surgery.</p>
<p t="543010" d="3720">And the rule is – and I think this is a
Jungian rule, but I can’t remember exactly</p>
<p t="546730" d="6630">where I read it – if you can’t understand
why someone is doing something, look at the</p>
<p t="553360" d="6020">consequences of their actions, whatever those
might be, and then infer the motivation from</p>
<p t="559380" d="1190">the consequences.</p>
<p t="560570" d="4620">So, if you see someone who seems to be doing
nothing except making everyone around them</p>
<p t="565190" d="4750">and themselves miserable, and you can’t
understand why, one of the hypotheses that</p>
<p t="569940" d="4070">you might entertain is that they are trying
to make everyone around them miserable, as</p>
<p t="574010" d="1210">well as themselves.</p>
<p t="575220" d="2520">And that is actually their goal.</p>
<p t="577740" d="4300">And it is hard for people to understand these
sorts of things, because when we see phenomena</p>
<p t="582040" d="6020">like the Columbine shooters, we always assume
that the reason that these people are doing</p>
<p t="588060" d="6029">these sorts of things, is for others reasons
than the reasons that appear to motivate them,</p>
<p t="594089" d="3811">or even the reasons they say they are doing
it, because the Columbine killers, especially</p>
<p t="597900" d="4260">the more literary one, he said exactly why
he was doing what he was doing.</p>
<p t="602160" d="2390">It is as clear as it could possibly be.</p>
<p t="604550" d="3930">All you have to do is go online, and read
what he said, and he tells what he was up</p>
<p t="608480" d="1000">to.</p>
<p t="609480" d="2360">But people don’t like to think that way
because they don’t believe that anybody</p>
<p t="611840" d="5400">could be consciously possessed of that much
malevolence without there being some other</p>
<p t="617240" d="5969">kind of cause, like he was bullied at school,
or he was an outcast, and, those things were</p>
<p t="623209" d="4820">only vaguely true and certainly they weren’t
more true of him than they were true of how</p>
<p t="628029" d="4201">many people in high school are bullied and
somehow outcast.</p>
<p t="632230" d="7000">It must be 10%, probably more like 30.That
doesn’t mean that schools are blowing up</p>
<p t="639230" d="1220">all over all the time.</p>
<p t="640450" d="2740">It is completely insufficient explanation.</p>
<p t="643190" d="7590">Anyways, for whatever reason, people turn
to possession by very, very strict ideological</p>
<p t="650780" d="1000">ideas.</p>
<p t="651780" d="4290">They were willing to be possessed by those
ideas to the point where they would undertake</p>
<p t="656070" d="6060">actions that you would think would be completely
impossible for theoretically civilized people.</p>
<p t="662130" d="5250">It turned out that those set of actions were
not only, were not impossible for civilized</p>
<p t="667380" d="5530">people, but that the people themselves, especially
in Nazi Germany, they pretty much knew what</p>
<p t="672910" d="1020">the hell was going on.</p>
<p t="673930" d="4779">You don’t take several million people out
of your population without rumor spreading</p>
<p t="678709" d="4581">let’s say, and so we should never forget
that Hitler was elected.</p>
<p t="683290" d="2239">He was elected by a large majority too.</p>
<p t="685529" d="6101">It was a landslide vote, it was the kind that
no modern democratic leader ever gets.</p>
<p t="691630" d="9330">So, although it is difficult to, it is difficult
for people to swallow, it is hard not to assign</p>
<p t="700960" d="6530">culpability for what happened in Germany to
the society at every strata.</p>
<p t="707490" d="5080">You can’t just dup it on the leaders and,
in fact, one of the things…here’s something</p>
<p t="712570" d="4650">to think about with regards to Hitler, because
one of the things you might ask is how the</p>
<p t="717220" d="5450">hell could he be so absolutely compelling
to his audiences.</p>
<p t="722670" d="2550">I will give you an explanation.</p>
<p t="725220" d="2950">Let’s make a few assumptions.</p>
<p t="728170" d="4930">The first assumption is: there are a lot of
modern resentful Germans kicking around.</p>
<p t="733100" d="1000">Why?</p>
<p t="734100" d="4239">Well, they lost the First World War, that
wasn’t so good, and then, there were a lot</p>
<p t="738339" d="3310">of brutal men left, because they had been
in the trenches, and they had been shooting</p>
<p t="741649" d="4911">and fighting and shooting at each other under
absolutely abhorrent conditions for like years,</p>
<p t="746560" d="2950">and years, and so there were plenty of utilized
men around.</p>
<p t="749510" d="5710">And then there a whole damn economy collapsed
because they were forced into signing what</p>
<p t="755220" d="6000">his stories regarded as a very punitive peace
treaty, so like…everything had fallen apart,</p>
<p t="761220" d="2490">to a degree that we cannot even begin to imagine.</p>
<p t="763710" d="6360">So, in the 1930s, the Germans were starting
to get back on their feet and when Hitler</p>
<p t="770070" d="4260">came to power, he started not only to rearm,
but to re-industrialize the economy, and he</p>
<p t="774330" d="2130">was actually pretty damn good at that.</p>
<p t="776460" d="7559">Now, Hitler was a good orator, but he, it
isn’t exactly clear that he was a coherent</p>
<p t="784019" d="5311">philosophical, theorizer, although to think
of him as stupid is completely missing the</p>
<p t="789330" d="1000">point.</p>
<p t="790330" d="1000">He was by no means stupid.</p>
<p t="791330" d="5360">I wouldn’t say that he was particularly
educated, but he had a very powerfully developed</p>
<p t="796690" d="4759">aesthetic sense, and he spent a lot of his
time designing the cities that would be built</p>
<p t="801449" d="4871">after World War II was over, and those cities
were generally conceptualized by him as places</p>
<p t="806320" d="4420">where the arts, or at least the Nazi version
of the arts, could flourish.</p>
<p t="810740" d="5740">So, there is no real evidence that what was
wrong with the Nazis was that they were civilized.</p>
<p t="816480" d="3570">There’s more evidence actually, I think,
that they were too civilized.</p>
<p t="820050" d="2050">I will talk you about that later.</p>
<p t="822100" d="5030">But anyways, you think: how did Hitler get
all these people under his spell?</p>
<p t="827130" d="4330">Well, here’s a hypothesis that is basically
derived from Jungian thinking.</p>
<p t="831460" d="4850">And I should let you know, by the way, because
Jung has been accused of being an anti-Semite,</p>
<p t="836310" d="4010">and there is various reasons for this, partly
because what happened during World War II,</p>
<p t="840320" d="6120">and partly because his theory drew heavily
from Christianity, although from many other</p>
<p t="846440" d="4480">sources as well, and he did believe that there
were differences in the psychology of people</p>
<p t="850920" d="1589">with different ethnicities.</p>
<p t="852509" d="4461">Now, whether that is racist or not, depends
on whether or not you like the person you</p>
<p t="856970" d="1000">are talking to.</p>
<p t="857970" d="3260">Because the leftists think that there are
cultural differences and they are important,</p>
<p t="861230" d="3090">but if you are talking about them in the wrong
way, then, you are racist.</p>
<p t="864320" d="3459">And the right wingers, they just think there
are ethnic differences to begin with.</p>
<p t="867779" d="2680">So, it’s a tricky issue.</p>
<p t="870459" d="3891">If there are differences that are important,
then who the hell cares about multiculturalism?</p>
<p t="874350" d="2299">It is not even worth preserving.</p>
<p t="876649" d="3701">If there are differences, you are stuck with
having to deal with the differences, so you</p>
<p t="880350" d="1500">are basically screwed either way.</p>
<p t="881850" d="5330">So, anyways, Jung has been the target of many
accusations of anti-Semitism, particularly</p>
<p t="887180" d="6900">by biographers who were resentful, and clueless,
and historically uninformed, and I would say</p>
<p t="894080" d="2860">malevolent, fundamentally.</p>
<p t="896940" d="4199">He worked as a CIA agent, it was just revealed
last year.</p>
<p t="901139" d="5211">He provided psychological reports to the American
government on an underlying psychological</p>
<p t="906350" d="2890">structure of the Nazi leaders for years.</p>
<p t="909240" d="5080">And he never told anybody about that while
he was alive, it only came to light, as far</p>
<p t="914320" d="2819">as I know, last year, perhaps the year before
that.</p>
<p t="917139" d="5491">So, anyways, the Germans they weren’t very
happy about the whole damn situation and so</p>
<p t="922630" d="3949">when they were aggregating on mass, you think,
what happens when all people get together</p>
<p t="926579" d="1061">in a group?</p>
<p t="927640" d="3980">We talked about last time when we talked about
Kierkegaard’s idea that, as soon as you</p>
<p t="931620" d="4790">get a bunch of people together, no matter
how truthful they are all as individuals,</p>
<p t="936410" d="5300">instantly, the crowd is not a truthful thing.</p>
<p t="941710" d="2739">There are real reasons for that, real psychological
reasons.</p>
<p t="944449" d="4721">There is the famous Asch experiment – I
hope that these are the right experiments,</p>
<p t="949170" d="1719">A-S-C-H – about line length.</p>
<p t="950889" d="4940">So, you draw two lines on the board, and they
are the same length, and you get the crowd</p>
<p t="955829" d="5611">to collaborate with you when you ask some
poor sucker who doesn’t know about the game</p>
<p t="961440" d="4420">to play, and you ask one person, and they
say “no, those lines are different in length.”</p>
<p t="965860" d="2930">And you ask another person “well, they are
quite different in length.”</p>
<p t="968790" d="3370">And another person says “yeah, sure, I can
see the difference in length.”</p>
<p t="972160" d="7580">And then you ask the poor pigeon “are they
different in length,” and then he says “yes.”</p>
<p t="979740" d="2010">And you can understand why.</p>
<p t="981750" d="5600">If all those other people are saying it, it
is either something wrong with all of them,</p>
<p t="987350" d="1349">which seems unlikely.</p>
<p t="988699" d="4451">Or he is the victim of a conspiracy, which
is a little on the paranoid side, but happens</p>
<p t="993150" d="2660">to actually be true in this case.</p>
<p t="995810" d="2920">Or, he is just not looking at it right.</p>
<p t="998730" d="3190">And you might think that the humble thing
to think is he is wrong.</p>
<p t="1001920" d="7620">So, the fact that somebody might go along
with the crowd, you can blame that on their</p>
<p t="1009540" d="5200">ability to be social and conventional, which
in many ways is a huge advantage, because</p>
<p t="1014740" d="5930">if you were all antisocial and unconventional,
there would be a good chunk of you in jail</p>
<p t="1020670" d="4770">and you certainly wouldn’t be having this
delightful, peaceful conversation that we</p>
<p t="1025440" d="1000">are having.</p>
<p t="1026440" d="6520">You don’t want to underestimate the utility
of conventionality to too much of a degree.</p>
<p t="1032960" d="5290">Anyways, so, there is this funny story I read
once, I don’t think it is true, but it might</p>
<p t="1038250" d="7110">be, where a psychology class got together
and decided they played trick on the professor.</p>
<p t="1045360" d="4980">And the trick was that, he would walk back
and forth, and the trick was that they wouldn’t</p>
<p t="1050340" d="3470">pay any attention at him at all if he was
on the left side of the room: they would talk</p>
<p t="1053810" d="1650">and look up.</p>
<p t="1055460" d="3940">And if he was on the right side of the room,
then they would really focus in and pay attention.</p>
<p t="1059400" d="5080">The story goes that, by several weeks of this
little trick, they had him right lecturing</p>
<p t="1064480" d="1140">right beside the door.</p>
<p t="1065620" d="2150">He wouldn’t move from that spot.</p>
<p t="1067770" d="4250">The reason I am telling you that is that it
is pretty obvious that people can respond</p>
<p t="1072020" d="2730">to the cues that the crowd is delivering.</p>
<p t="1074750" d="4260">A good speaker does a variety of things.</p>
<p t="1079010" d="2960">One is they never talk to the crowd.</p>
<p t="1081970" d="5700">You pick out specific individuals and talk
to them, and they’re reflective of the crowd.</p>
<p t="1087670" d="4500">Then you can tell if everyone understands,
and the other thing that a good speaker does</p>
<p t="1092170" d="5480">is pay attention to the responses of the crowd.</p>
<p t="1097650" d="8391">If a lecture is really a dialogue, even though
the audience is only emitting the non-verbal</p>
<p t="1106041" d="5739">elements of the conversation, those non-verbal
elements are important.</p>
<p t="1111780" d="2790">You want to stay in touch with the non-verbal
communications.</p>
<p t="1114570" d="2970">Now, Hitler, he is kind of a chaotic guy.</p>
<p t="1117540" d="4190">He is very angry; he is angry in part because
he is a frustrated art student.</p>
<p t="1121730" d="6110">He tried to get into art school four times;
so really the person to blame for World War</p>
<p t="1127840" d="5490">II was the four person committee that wouldn’t
let poor Hitler into the Viennese School of</p>
<p t="1133330" d="1000">Art.</p>
<p t="1134330" d="2370">He really wanted to go and had some artistic
talent.</p>
<p t="1136700" d="5540">He was a little on the conventional side by
all appearances, but I’ve seen some of his</p>
<p t="1142240" d="2400">sketches, and he wasn’t a complete piker.</p>
<p t="1144640" d="4690">H felt maybe it was okay to go to university
because he just been through World War I,</p>
<p t="1149330" d="1810">and that wasn’t much fun.</p>
<p t="1151140" d="4200">There is this story about Hitler where he
was out in the trenches, and he was there</p>
<p t="1155340" d="4010">with all these buddies, and he wandered off
to do whatever he wanted to do, and when he</p>
<p t="1159350" d="4330">came back they were all dead because a bomb
landed in the middle of them.</p>
<p t="1163680" d="4300">You think that would do something to your
psyche because after an experience like that,</p>
<p t="1167980" d="3790">you’re either going to think, “Oh man
things are pretty random and horrible” or</p>
<p t="1171770" d="5640">“there is something pretty special about
me because I wasn’t killed by the bomb”.</p>
<p t="1177410" d="2570">Maybe God has saved me for a higher purpose.</p>
<p t="1179980" d="4700">You can be absolutely sure that if you went
through an experience like that, then something</p>
<p t="1184680" d="2970">like that would be rattling around in your
mind.</p>
<p t="1187650" d="5970">He won a medal for bravery, and after World
War I, he kind of wandered around like a lot</p>
<p t="1193620" d="2290">of men unemployed and like a trap.</p>
<p t="1195910" d="2710">He wasn’t very happy about that.</p>
<p t="1198620" d="4640">No wonder, so anyways, he didn’t get into
art school.</p>
<p t="1203260" d="5370">Now he didn’t really have a fully developed
political theory, but he was pretty good at</p>
<p t="1208630" d="5860">speaking and there were a lot of people to
hear him speak because people were trying</p>
<p t="1214490" d="3180">to figure out what the hell to do about all
the chaos.</p>
<p t="1217670" d="4470">So then you think well what was Hitler good
at?</p>
<p t="1222140" d="5660">Well, now I’m going to switch to a slightly
different story and get back to this one.</p>
<p t="1227800" d="8370">I don’t know if you guys know about the
daycare scandals that were very common in</p>
<p t="1236170" d="1000">the 1980’s.</p>
<p t="1237170" d="4430">It was so horribly common actually, and this
infested many towns.</p>
<p t="1241600" d="4460">Usually what would happen someone who was
a little on the paranoid side or a lot on</p>
<p t="1246060" d="3030">the paranoid side would send his or her children
off to daycare.</p>
<p t="1249090" d="4310">That was the new thing in the 80’s because
women were moving into the workforce like</p>
<p t="1253400" d="1000">mad.</p>
<p t="1254400" d="5330">They were handing their infants (kids below
three) to total strangers.</p>
<p t="1259730" d="3750">For some of them that set off a fair bit of
worry, like it still does, and sometimes that</p>
<p t="1263480" d="5500">worry got out on the hand, especially those
who were predisposed to paranoia and schizophrenia</p>
<p t="1268980" d="4080">and maybe some had previous episodes.</p>
<p t="1273060" d="4850">The kid would come home and the mother would
observe something or note something particular</p>
<p t="1277910" d="4090">about their behaviour and would fantasize
about what that was.</p>
<p t="1282000" d="4340">Was the child being touched in any particular
way?</p>
<p t="1286340" d="2970">She would keep this up for a good length of
time.</p>
<p t="1289310" d="4000">Soon the child would start having nightmares,
and then the child would start to tell the</p>
<p t="1293310" d="4880">mother what the nightmares were and that would
freak her out so she would ask deeper questions,</p>
<p t="1298190" d="4340">and soon her children were telling her that
horrible things were happening to them at</p>
<p t="1302530" d="1270">daycare.</p>
<p t="1303800" d="3860">Then she would go to the police, and they
would look into her psychiatric background.</p>
<p t="1307660" d="5240">The police would start to interview other
children, and if they interviewed them properly,</p>
<p t="1312900" d="4300">the other children would develop other stories.</p>
<p t="1317200" d="1290">How did that happen?</p>
<p t="1318490" d="1280">Well, a bunch of ways.</p>
<p t="1319770" d="8890">The first is the police would ask leading
questions, like did anyone touch you?</p>
<p t="1328660" d="4000">Well of course someone touched the kids, everyone
touches kids.</p>
<p t="1332660" d="2310">Did anyone touch you there?</p>
<p t="1334970" d="4210">Well that’s not a question, that’s a piece
of information.</p>
<p t="1339180" d="5380">The piece of information is that if someone
touched me there, then an adult would be really</p>
<p t="1344560" d="3150">interested in that, right?</p>
<p t="1347710" d="3640">What is a child doing when the child is answering
the adult’s questions?</p>
<p t="1351350" d="2090">What do they know?</p>
<p t="1353440" d="1270">They’re three-years-old.</p>
<p t="1354710" d="2550">They can hardly organize their story.</p>
<p t="1357260" d="5470">If you’re talking to a kid, and you want
them to give you an account of their day,</p>
<p t="1362730" d="4350">you have to really guide them through the
organization of their memory, and partly what</p>
<p t="1367080" d="3430">they’re doing when you’re doing that is
that they’re looking at you trying to figure</p>
<p t="1370510" d="4860">out if they are telling you the right things
which is what they should be doing because</p>
<p t="1375370" d="3850">what they are trying to do is tell people
things in a way that they’ll understand.</p>
<p t="1379220" d="6410">This makes the child very responsive to the
nonverbal and verbal cues of the adult.</p>
<p t="1385630" d="3100">Think about how fast those little rats try
to pick up language.</p>
<p t="1388730" d="4220">It’s really fast and no one really teaches
them; they’re just they’re paying attention</p>
<p t="1392950" d="1210">like mad.</p>
<p t="1394160" d="6060">You get a bunch of cops who are on an adventure
that they think there is some serial sexual</p>
<p t="1400220" d="1280">perverts in their midst.</p>
<p t="1401500" d="7940">They interview 15-20 kids; they do it a lot
with these little dolls, and they do it a</p>
<p t="1409440" d="1530">lot.</p>
<p t="1410970" d="5200">Sooner or later all the kids start having
nightmares, and then start telling the cops</p>
<p t="1416170" d="3740">these terrible things happened like they’re
being taken down to an under cabin and take</p>
<p t="1419910" d="4170">their clothes off and forced to play leap
frog.</p>
<p t="1424080" d="2040">You can’t believe it.</p>
<p t="1426120" d="5090">It’s all documented in a book called Satan’s
Silence, which was written by a social worker</p>
<p t="1431210" d="1390">and a lawyer.</p>
<p t="1432600" d="1230">It’s mind-boggling.</p>
<p t="1433830" d="6740">The longest prison sentences in American history
were handed out to a series of middle-aged</p>
<p t="1440570" d="2430">women who were taken care of little kids.</p>
<p t="1443000" d="6390">The FBI even came up with a whole new criminal
category: Late Onset Female Sexual Offender.</p>
<p t="1449390" d="2800">Why didn’t that category exist before?</p>
<p t="1452190" d="5440">It’s simple; there are no late onset female
sexual offenders.</p>
<p t="1457630" d="2670">That’s why we didn’t need to category.</p>
<p t="1460300" d="4840">Once all these accusations came up, you needed
some category for these women.</p>
<p t="1465140" d="5650">Some were thrown in jail for 350 years, which
seems a bit excessive seeing as they’ll</p>
<p t="1470790" d="1990">only last 40.</p>
<p t="1472780" d="4210">They get 12 consecutive life sentences.</p>
<p t="1476990" d="6390">There is actually a situation where one town
went so far as to start digging underneath</p>
<p t="1483380" d="5340">the town to find these underground satanic
layers where all these weird rituals would</p>
<p t="1488720" d="1960">be going on.</p>
<p t="1490680" d="5450">Along with this was not one shred of concrete
evidence.</p>
<p t="1496130" d="4180">The eventual conclusions, and this affected
thousands of people.</p>
<p t="1500310" d="7550">The eventual conclusion was that there actually
isn’t anyone whose satanically torturing</p>
<p t="1507860" d="3680">children in daycare centres.</p>
<p t="1511540" d="5660">Why am I telling you this?</p>
<p t="1517200" d="8340">Well, what the children were doing, if you
think about it, how did they come up with</p>
<p t="1525540" d="1000">these weird ideas?</p>
<p t="1526540" d="6630">You should know that the children are not
stupid, and they can also dream up about the</p>
<p t="1533170" d="2650">most horrible things.</p>
<p t="1535820" d="5120">They have an imagination that is capable of
extending itself out into the terrifying.</p>
<p t="1540940" d="3960">Everyone knows that because all you have to
do is remember you are a kid when you were</p>
<p t="1544900" d="4300">hiding under the covers because there were
horrible things in your dark room.</p>
<p t="1549200" d="4130">You could populate the darkness with monsters
with no problem, and you should be able to</p>
<p t="1553330" d="2390">because there are monsters in the darkness.</p>
<p t="1555720" d="2730">Even though your parents might tell you they’re
not.</p>
<p t="1558450" d="5070">There might not be any monsters in that particularly
piece of darkness and that’s a perfectly</p>
<p t="1563520" d="2740">reasonable thing to tell your children.</p>
<p t="1566260" d="1900">Darkness as a whole, that’s a different
story.</p>
<p t="1568160" d="3250">The children aren’t stupid.</p>
<p t="1571410" d="6320">Now the adults start to question them and
the back of the kid’s brain, the imaginative</p>
<p t="1577730" d="3170">part what do these people want?</p>
<p t="1580900" d="5950">They throw them out a little bit of information,
and the adults will perk up, and they will</p>
<p t="1586850" d="2220">focus on that piece of information.</p>
<p t="1589070" d="6890">Maybe it’s a cop who really hates child
Satanist doctors which is perfectly reasonable</p>
<p t="1595960" d="1000">stance.</p>
<p t="1596960" d="6270">So when the child offers any information about
the existence of such a thing, the cop will</p>
<p t="1603230" d="7530">perk up, and the child will say something
related is occurring.</p>
<p t="1610760" d="1670">Their imagination is working.</p>
<p t="1612430" d="3820">How do I model the reality that’s being
presented to me?</p>
<p t="1616250" d="5340">That’s when the dreams start to kick in.</p>
<p t="1621590" d="10630">By speaking in the appropriate way, you can
get all sorts of things churned up in the</p>
<p t="1632220" d="6560">unconscious minds of your listeners.</p>
<p t="1638780" d="7330">By watching them as well, you can extract
out their unconscious desires.</p>
<p t="1646110" d="5360">Now I am speaking to you all, and you’re
all are irritated because your life has been</p>
<p t="1651470" d="2160">really awful for 15 years.</p>
<p t="1653630" d="12940">I’m saying this and that, and then I say
something initially dismissive of Jews.</p>
<p t="1666570" d="4790">You’re all mad, and there are two or three
people who go “yeah”.</p>
<p t="1671360" d="6790">I think that’s an interesting response,
and then I lay out a couple more ideas and</p>
<p t="1678150" d="3340">some don’t get any response and others people
perk right up.</p>
<p t="1681490" d="5290">And I am not stupid and I am trying to get
the bloody attention of the crowd.</p>
<p t="1686780" d="7280">And, if I do that fifty times, the crowd is
going to tell me an awful lot about what they</p>
<p t="1694060" d="2580">want, especially if I am willing to follow
them.</p>
<p t="1696640" d="4181">And I can do that easily, especially if I
start to work the crowd a little bit, because</p>
<p t="1700821" d="8399">I can capitalize on their emotions and the
display of that emotion, and I can learn to</p>
<p t="1709220" d="3790">play that, and then that turns into a positive
feedback loop.</p>
<p t="1713010" d="4060">And, so, Hitler is informing the audience
and the audience is informing Hitler, and</p>
<p t="1717070" d="8380">that is why Jung believed Hitler embodied
the shadow of the German people.</p>
<p t="1725450" d="9600">So, that is another reason why you should
be careful what you say, why you are saying</p>
<p t="1735050" d="4240">it, and why you are looking for attention,
and all of those things, and naturally what</p>
<p t="1739290" d="4210">is motivating you, and actually what is motivating
the people who are listening to you, because</p>
<p t="1743500" d="2990">God only knows where you might go if you are
not careful.</p>
<p t="1746490" d="5320">Actually, we do know where you go if you ae
not careful, and it is not pretty, that is</p>
<p t="1751810" d="1000">for sure.</p>
<p t="1752810" d="4080">And to think that we have learned anything
from that it’s like no, that is not right.</p>
<p t="1756890" d="2700">We haven’t learned a damn thing from it.</p>
<p t="1759590" d="3020">So, because we don’t want to understand
it.</p>
<p t="1762610" d="2910">Now these guys are not concerned with that
sort of that thing, they are highly concerned</p>
<p t="1765520" d="1000">with it.</p>
<p t="1766520" d="3610">Now, Binswanger and Boss, they both had been
influenced by Freud and by Jung.</p>
<p t="1770130" d="6840">You can see in the bottom right hand corner
there, that is Bass with Jung, and that is</p>
<p t="1776970" d="2480">Binswanger on the left, and Bass at the top
there.</p>
<p t="1779450" d="4290">So, they are pretty thoughtful looking guys
and they were pretty damn smart, and they</p>
<p t="1783740" d="5460">were quite philosophically oriented, and they
had both studied Heidegger and Husserl, who</p>
<p t="1789200" d="1730">were German philosophers.</p>
<p t="1790930" d="6200">Heidegger actually got tangled right up in
the Nazi movement, and his philosophy has</p>
<p t="1797130" d="5130">been cast under a cloud of suspicion – perhaps
a well-deserved cloud of suspicion – as</p>
<p t="1802260" d="2870">consequence of his cooperation with the Nazis.</p>
<p t="1805130" d="3690">So, it wasn’t only stupid people who got
tangled up in this.</p>
<p t="1808820" d="2470">It was pretty much everybody who got tangled
in it.</p>
<p t="1811290" d="7350">And one of the things you might think about
is: if you were there, for any one of you,</p>
<p t="1818640" d="3010">there is a 90% chance that you would have
got tangled up in it.</p>
<p t="1821650" d="4020">You wouldn’t have been a person who rescued
the gypsies, forget that.</p>
<p t="1825670" d="5820">Unless you think that you are heroic far beyond
the average, and I would be very, very careful</p>
<p t="1831490" d="3910">about assuming that, you could assume instead
that you have been swapped along with the</p>
<p t="1835400" d="5850">crowd, just like everyone else, because everyone
else was.</p>
<p t="1841250" d="4910">Part of what these guys were trying to figure
out is: in some sense, there were two things.</p>
<p t="1846160" d="6530">There was the function and structure of belief
systems; and then, the nature of that which</p>
<p t="1852690" d="2590">transcends the belief system.</p>
<p t="1855280" d="6350">So, what transcends the belief system is what
you don’t know if you use the beliefs, because</p>
<p t="1861630" d="3750">there are things outside of your belief system
and they have a nature as well.</p>
<p t="1865380" d="4730">Usually, you run into those sorts of things
when you make a mistake, and things don’t</p>
<p t="1870110" d="3980">happen the way you want them to, or desire
them to.</p>
<p t="1874090" d="4980">So, and then the other problem you are trying
to solve in some sense is: what is the appropriate</p>
<p t="1879070" d="6870">mode of behaviour for an individual in relationship
to belief systems and to the world that transcends</p>
<p t="1885940" d="1210">the belief systems?</p>
<p t="1887150" d="3460">And the reason they were interested in that
it is because they thought “well, maybe</p>
<p t="1890610" d="4100">it would be a good idea if our belief systems
didn’t get so damn pathological.”</p>
<p t="1894710" d="5690">Because, if they do, then, six million end
up in ovens, and a hundred twenty million</p>
<p t="1900400" d="2090">people end up dead in battlefields.</p>
<p t="1902490" d="6560">That doesn’t count the Stalin massacres
or Mao who made Hitler, in a sense look like</p>
<p t="1909050" d="2510">an absolute amateur.</p>
<p t="1911560" d="4500">Stalin starved 6 million people to death in
the Ukraine in the 1930s, and he was just</p>
<p t="1916060" d="2420">warming up.</p>
<p t="1918480" d="2900">How many of you have heard of the Ukraine
famine?</p>
<p t="1921380" d="1690">How many of you haven’t?</p>
<p t="1923070" d="5500">Yes, well think about that, how many of you
knew Mao killed a hundred million people?</p>
<p t="1928570" d="2080">How many of you didn’t?</p>
<p t="1930650" d="2380">You might think about why you don’t know
that.</p>
<p t="1933030" d="3760">You know about the damn Nazis, but you don’t
know about the horrors that the Communists</p>
<p t="1936790" d="1000">perpetrated.</p>
<p t="1937790" d="6410">It is worth thinking about why, because the
communists, especially the Maoists, those</p>
<p t="1944200" d="1390">people were brutal.</p>
<p t="1945590" d="5510">It is really important, of all the things
that you can possibly learn psychologically</p>
<p t="1951100" d="4240">from the twentieth century – and it is what
these characters in the ‘50’s were concentrating</p>
<p t="1955340" d="2010">on.</p>
<p t="1957350" d="5560">Things can go powerfully sideways, it is a
great shock to everyone because, in some sense,</p>
<p t="1962910" d="4360">everyone was pretty thrilled that beginning
of the 19th century that religion, classical</p>
<p t="1967270" d="1910">religion beliefs, had crumbled.</p>
<p t="1969180" d="4240">The Marxists said the damn religion was there
to depress the poor and depressed anyways,</p>
<p t="1973420" d="5520">and to keep the priests in aristocracy in
power, I am sure you learned plenty of that</p>
<p t="1978940" d="5940">in your classes, that sort of thinking, power,
economics-related thinking and it is typically</p>
<p t="1984880" d="7210">of 
intellectually manipulative left-wing thinkers.</p>
<p t="1992090" d="2820">That is basically their routine.</p>
<p t="1994910" d="4300">They reduce everything to a single damn motivation,
and it is usually economics or power, then</p>
<p t="1999210" d="2280">they explain everything from that perspective.</p>
<p t="2001490" d="9690">It is so boneheaded, it should be illegal.</p>
<p t="2011180" d="3220">The Marxists were happy that religion had
collapsed because they thought that that would</p>
<p t="2014400" d="2230">eliminate an entire strata of oppression.</p>
<p t="2016630" d="4830">And, you can see that, it is not like the
Catholic Church was free of corruption.</p>
<p t="2021460" d="4681">In many ways, it is a corrupt enterprise,
and you can read it as solely a corrupt enterprise.</p>
<p t="2026141" d="5099">And the hell with it, it’s good that it’s
corrupt.</p>
<p t="2031240" d="5080">And, the Freudian basically thought the same
way and so did most intellectuals.</p>
<p t="2036320" d="7510">Freud thought that religion was nothing than
a childish delusion that people identified</p>
<p t="2043830" d="2280">with because they were afraid of dying.</p>
<p t="2046110" d="3500">It was a defence against death anxiety.</p>
<p t="2049610" d="4270">Look, the Marxist argument in and the Freudian
argument those are bloody powerful arguments,</p>
<p t="2053880" d="4560">because you can see it: do people use their
religious beliefs as a defence against things</p>
<p t="2058440" d="2210">they are too terrified to confront?</p>
<p t="2060650" d="1050">Obviously.</p>
<p t="2061700" d="7550">Does the church oppress people, did it engage
in conspiracies with people in power across</p>
<p t="2069250" d="1490">centuries?</p>
<p t="2070740" d="1480">Obviously.</p>
<p t="2072220" d="2760">The question is “well, what do you make
of that?”</p>
<p t="2074980" d="5490">Well, partly you make of that all sorts of
structures do that.</p>
<p t="2080470" d="3810">You can’t just damn one structure and think
the others are going to know.</p>
<p t="2084280" d="3660">It is like, the right wingers they always
go on about big government, how terrible that</p>
<p t="2087940" d="3940">is, and the left wing they always go on about
how big corporations are terrible.</p>
<p t="2091880" d="4411">Well, bank is terrible, doesn’t matter if
it is government or corporations, because</p>
<p t="2096291" d="7209">things tend to tilt towards corruption across
time, and that has to be taken into account.</p>
<p t="2103500" d="5310">So, the Freudians and the intellectuals, and
the Marxists were all pretty happy when the</p>
<p t="2108810" d="4790">religious streams started to come apart and
they believed that the new edifices that they</p>
<p t="2113600" d="5020">were going to construct: fascist and communist,
would be so much better than what they replaced</p>
<p t="2118620" d="3140">that everybody would be drowning in utopia.</p>
<p t="2121760" d="9660">And, it is too bad this isn’t how it turned
out, but it certainly is not how it turned</p>
<p t="2131420" d="1000">out.</p>
<p t="2132420" d="6240">How it turned out was: Sometimes, when you
tear something down, even if you think it</p>
<p t="2138660" d="5810">is terrible, you end up constructing something
on its roots that makes the previous terrible</p>
<p t="2144470" d="4320">look like the work of an amateur, and that
is certainly what happened in the twentieth</p>
<p t="2148790" d="1000">century.</p>
<p t="2149790" d="4860">I mean, no matter what you say about the Catholic
Church and its basic barbarism, especially</p>
<p t="2154650" d="3450">when they were involved in the witch hunt
in the Middle Ages.</p>
<p t="2158100" d="4210">Those guys…they are amateurs compared to
the Fascists and the Communists.</p>
<p t="2162310" d="5750">They recount their victims into tens of thousands,
not in hundreds of millions.</p>
<p t="2168060" d="2380">So, anyways, things didn’t go so well.</p>
<p t="2170440" d="5180">And, by the 1950s, especially because the
Cold War started and the day that Second World</p>
<p t="2175620" d="5340">War, and it ended with the atomic bomb in
Japan, and the Russians had the damn atomic</p>
<p t="2180960" d="6240">bomb tomorrow, fundamentally, and both the
Russians and Americans had the hydrogen bombs</p>
<p t="2187200" d="1530">by the early 1950s.</p>
<p t="2188730" d="7270">And I don’t know if you know this: do you
know that a hydrogen bomb uses an atom bond</p>
<p t="2196000" d="1940">for its trigger?</p>
<p t="2197940" d="7900">So, in the hydrogen bomb, the atom bomb stands
in relationship to a hydrogen bomb, like the</p>
<p t="2205840" d="4780">ignition cap on a shelf stands in relationship
to the gunpowder.</p>
<p t="2210620" d="2960">The atomic bomb blast just gets the explosion
going.</p>
<p t="2213580" d="5710">So, hydrogen bombs, they are like way, way
more explosive than atomic bombs.</p>
<p t="2219290" d="5590">So, by the middle of the 1950s, we pretty
much put ourselves in the position, where</p>
<p t="2224880" d="5420">they were building some mighty big bombs,
I mean really, and unbelievable, unbelievably</p>
<p t="2230300" d="4460">big bombs, four hundred times as big as the
one that wiped out Hiroshima.</p>
<p t="2234760" d="4670">Huge, huge bombs, and they get pretty damn
good at it.</p>
<p t="2239430" d="7200">By the mid-1950s, it was like, we developed
enough fire power on both sides of the Atlantic,</p>
<p t="2246630" d="4480">along with the missiles necessary to deliver
them, which the Nazis had basically invented</p>
<p t="2251110" d="1090">in World War II.</p>
<p t="2252200" d="5000">It was all Nazi scientists to invent rockets,
and they were all taken by the Americans after</p>
<p t="2257200" d="2720">World War II, the work on the American space
programs, basically.</p>
<p t="2259920" d="4440">And, so, by the 1950s, we had the missiles
deliver the damn things too.</p>
<p t="2264360" d="3700">So, not only were the psychologists who were
thinking about things sort of shortened out</p>
<p t="2268060" d="4630">about what happened in World War II, for good
reason, and then of course all the Stalinist</p>
<p t="2272690" d="2680">horrors were starting to be revealed at that
point.</p>
<p t="2275370" d="3900">Although it took Western intellectuals like
thirty years before they gave them any credence</p>
<p t="2279270" d="1000">at all.</p>
<p t="2280270" d="3760">I think Jean-Paul Sartre was still a member
of the Communist Party up until 1970.</p>
<p t="2284030" d="6490">It was very common, particularly among French
intellectuals, even though the news was getting</p>
<p t="2290520" d="1620">out.</p>
<p t="2292140" d="7240">Careful observers like George Orwell had pretty
much figured out by the late ‘30s that not</p>
<p t="2299380" d="3160">all was right in the paradise of Stalin.</p>
<p t="2302540" d="3280">People thought he was a right-winger, and
didn’t listen to him much, even though he</p>
<p t="2305820" d="6570">was a left-winger.</p>
<p t="2312390" d="3440">These existential phenomenologists, they’re
trying to figure out “okay, we’ve got</p>
<p t="2315830" d="3960">a big problem here: the belief systems are
seriously going sideways.”</p>
<p t="2319790" d="5640">There’s some indication that there’s some
individual responsibility for that, of some</p>
<p t="2325430" d="1790">indeterminate nature.</p>
<p t="2327220" d="4740">If you live in a country where everyone has
turned into a fascist murderer, is that your</p>
<p t="2331960" d="1000">fault?</p>
<p t="2332960" d="5620">Well, it’s not obvious that an individual
should be held responsible for the action</p>
<p t="2338580" d="4400">of an entire country, but then again, the
country is made up of individuals so it’s</p>
<p t="2342980" d="3050">a very difficult problem to solve.</p>
<p t="2346030" d="4290">One of the tenets of Western law is that you
don’t hold an individual responsible for</p>
<p t="2350320" d="5280">the actions for the group even if he or she
happens to be a member, willingly or unwillingly,</p>
<p t="2355600" d="1560">of that group.</p>
<p t="2357160" d="3090">But you can’t ignore the fact that all these
things were made up of people, and then you</p>
<p t="2360250" d="5150">also can’t ignore the fact that it was individuals
who were doing the terrible things that were</p>
<p t="2365400" d="1110">being done to people.</p>
<p t="2366510" d="5400">In Auschwitz, for example, one of the little
tricks that the guards used to do was to bring</p>
<p t="2371910" d="4220">the Jews off the freight cars— a lot of
them had died in the freight cars¬ because</p>
<p t="2376130" d="4140">they were packed in like ‘this’, so lots
of them would suffocate, or the old ones would</p>
<p t="2380270" d="3730">die, or the little kids would die and that
was okay.</p>
<p t="2384000" d="4140">Then along the outside of the freight car,
especially if it was winter, it’s 20 below</p>
<p t="2388140" d="4010">and the ones on the outside would freeze but
you’re going to get rid of them anyway so</p>
<p t="2392150" d="1610">that was just convenient, mostly.</p>
<p t="2393760" d="5190">Then, you’d take them to Auschwitz and they’d
all spill out, speaking different languages,</p>
<p t="2398950" d="5290">torn up from their family, as miserable as
people can possibly be.</p>
<p t="2404240" d="8570">One trick was to have someone who was not
quite dead enough pick up a sack of wet salt,</p>
<p t="2412810" d="4900">so that’s 100 lbs., and carry it from one
side of the compound to the other– and then</p>
<p t="2417710" d="1280">back.</p>
<p t="2418990" d="1500">One side and then back.</p>
<p t="2420490" d="4020">You don’t want to be thinking about these
camps like a football field; these bloody</p>
<p t="2424510" d="1700">things were cities.</p>
<p t="2426210" d="4650">They were big: they held tens of thousands
of people, and so there’s some guard and</p>
<p t="2430860" d="1870">he thinks that’s a pretty good joke.</p>
<p t="2432730" d="2810">It’s not just a few people who are like
that.</p>
<p t="2435540" d="4100">We found out from the Stanford Prison Experiment,
which every psychologist likes to think of</p>
<p t="2439640" d="5500">as immoral because we actually discovered
something with it, that if you gave ordinary</p>
<p t="2445140" d="5830">people the opportunity to be fascist barbarians,
in 6 days, 30% of them would be.</p>
<p t="2450970" d="5670">What we learned from that is social psychologists
shouldn’t run the Stanford prison experiment.</p>
<p t="2456640" d="4540">That’s not the right conclusion to draw.</p>
<p t="2461180" d="3750">These phenomenologists were all concerned
about this, thinking “what the hell should</p>
<p t="2464930" d="1000">we do about that?”.</p>
<p t="2465930" d="7920">They’re starting to think about how belief
systems are constructed.</p>
<p t="2473850" d="5100">The first proposition that they make is that
we should treat the reality that we’re dealing</p>
<p t="2478950" d="4840">with, as psychologists; we should treat human
experience as that reality.</p>
<p t="2483790" d="5180">The reality, for you, from a phenomenological
perspective, is that everything you experience</p>
<p t="2488970" d="6560">is real, and they also assume that you can’t
get more real than that.</p>
<p t="2495530" d="3560">Your consciousness, whatever that is, is real,
and your dreams are real, and your emotions</p>
<p t="2499090" d="4740">are real, and your pain is real– which is
a really useful thing to think if you want</p>
<p t="2503830" d="2250">to make sure that you’re not going to hurt
people.</p>
<p t="2506080" d="4350">You kind of have to think that maybe pain
should be treated as a fundamental reality</p>
<p t="2510430" d="3210">instead of as an epiphenomena of some material
substrate.</p>
<p t="2513640" d="2310">That’s their first perspective.</p>
<p t="2515950" d="5150">They took that from Heidegger because Heidegger
thought that Western philosophy had gone off</p>
<p t="2521100" d="6550">on the wrong track 3000 years ago because
we didn’t really concentrate on being itself</p>
<p t="2527650" d="1720">as the fundamental mystery.</p>
<p t="2529370" d="4230">The fundamental mystery is: why the hell is
there anything?</p>
<p t="2533600" d="5500">Since there is some experiential being, what
are its fundamental elements?</p>
<p t="2539100" d="6380">That’s the phenomenological stance; it’s
not the same a scientific approach because</p>
<p t="2545480" d="2490">it starts with a different presupposition.</p>
<p t="2547970" d="7320">The scientific presupposition, roughly speaking,
is that the objectively real elements of things</p>
<p t="2555290" d="1890">are the most real elements.</p>
<p t="2557180" d="5330">There’s no sense complaining about that
because it’s an approach that works tremendously</p>
<p t="2562510" d="4410">well for many, many things—including making
hydrogen bombs, for example.</p>
<p t="2566920" d="6330">But it’s also reasonable to think that it
might not be the whole truth and nothing but</p>
<p t="2573250" d="1000">the truth.</p>
<p t="2574250" d="5030">Maybe you could also suspect that the fact
that we can manufacture hydrogen bombs might</p>
<p t="2579280" d="4910">indicate that there’s something a trifle
off with our fundamental belief systems, scientific</p>
<p t="2584190" d="1620">though they may be.</p>
<p t="2585810" d="2900">That was certainly something that concerned
Heidegger, even though he got all tangled</p>
<p t="2588710" d="1830">up with the Nazis.</p>
<p t="2590540" d="4610">The phenomenologists were trying to take apart
the experience as such, and they made some</p>
<p t="2595150" d="3060">hypotheses, and then some observations.</p>
<p t="2598210" d="5920">The first is that: we’re going to assume
that your experience– that experience itself–</p>
<p t="2604130" d="1520">is real.</p>
<p t="2605650" d="7370">Now, just because dreams are real and pain
is real, and objects that we can all perceive</p>
<p t="2613020" d="3210">are real, doesn’t mean you should put them
all in the same category.</p>
<p t="2616230" d="5610">My dreams are not in the same category of
reality as this table because you don’t</p>
<p t="2621840" d="2880">have access to my dreams, and you have access
to the table.</p>
<p t="2624720" d="3520">But that doesn’t mean that my dreams and
my pains and my emotions aren’t real.</p>
<p t="2628240" d="1000">They’re real.</p>
<p t="2629240" d="6210">That’s the first, and you should note that
this is a proposition.</p>
<p t="2635450" d="6260">What they’re saying is: let’s act as if
that’s true and then work from those premises</p>
<p t="2641710" d="2640">and see what happens, see where we can get
with it.</p>
<p t="2644350" d="4780">That’s a perfectly reasonable thing to do
because at the bottom of a theory you always</p>
<p t="2649130" d="1790">have to put an assumption.</p>
<p t="2650920" d="4230">Otherwise, your theory would be one hundred
percent right, and would cover everything–</p>
<p t="2655150" d="3280">and it doesn’t, so you have to throw an
assumption somewhere in there at the bottom</p>
<p t="2658430" d="6020">and say “okay, we’re not questioning that,
that’s the starting point.”.</p>
<p t="2664450" d="5760">You have to do that because you’re ignorant,
you don’t have a full theory.</p>
<p t="2670210" d="3150">They (the phenomenologists) don’t like the
idea that mind can be reduced to matter, they’re</p>
<p t="2673360" d="1180">not playing that game.</p>
<p t="2674540" d="5330">They’re not playing the game that the subject
is only epiphenomenal and the object is real,</p>
<p t="2679870" d="1580">they’re not playing that game either.</p>
<p t="2681450" d="6210">It’s partly because, as Boss says, “Without
a subject, nothing at all would exist to confront</p>
<p t="2687660" d="2820">objects and to imagine them as such”.</p>
<p t="2690480" d="5730">True, this implies that every object, everything
objective, is merely objective in being merely</p>
<p t="2696210" d="4140">objectivized by the subject, is the most subjective
thing possible.</p>
<p t="2700350" d="10130">It’s a radical claim, but here’s something
to think about: when I look at that coke can,</p>
<p t="2710480" d="6210">you might say I perceive the object and then
make inferences about its use, and then I</p>
<p t="2716690" d="2010">evaluate it and then I use it.</p>
<p t="2718700" d="2020">That is not actually what you do.</p>
<p t="2720720" d="5010">In fact, it’s not obvious at all that what
you perceive are objects.</p>
<p t="2725730" d="8270">If you think about it, people weren’t perceiving
scientific objects until about 1500, 1450</p>
<p t="2734000" d="1010">A.D.</p>
<p t="2735010" d="5860">There was no “objective object” before
then.</p>
<p t="2740870" d="4620">Obviously whatever we were perceiving was
not precisely that because we would have been</p>
<p t="2745490" d="1210">scientists right off the bat.</p>
<p t="2746700" d="4750">George Kelly claimed that people were natural
scientists, that we’re always investigating</p>
<p t="2751450" d="2530">hypotheses and trying to disprove them and
so on.</p>
<p t="2753980" d="4440">It’s an interesting theory and it’s right
in a sense but fundamentally, it’s wrong.</p>
<p t="2758420" d="3800">We are not natural scientists, we’re natural
engineers.</p>
<p t="2762220" d="3920">When we look at the world, we don’t see
objects and then infer their use, what we</p>
<p t="2766140" d="3230">actually see is the use.</p>
<p t="2769370" d="5450">For example, when I look at that coke can
my visual system activates my motor cortex</p>
<p t="2774820" d="1000">directly.</p>
<p t="2775820" d="4050">It can do that without me seeing the damn
can consciously– to some degree.</p>
<p t="2779870" d="3420">There are people with blind sight, I’ve
told you about those people, they say they</p>
<p t="2783290" d="4260">can’t see but if you ask them which have
you have held up they can tell you.</p>
<p t="2787550" d="5320">They might not be able to see, but they can
map patterns from their visual system onto</p>
<p t="2792870" d="1390">their motor output.</p>
<p t="2794260" d="4350">That’s basically what Piaget said we do
when we deal with the world.</p>
<p t="2798610" d="4680">We’re embodied creatures, so what we see
when we look around aren’t “objects”,</p>
<p t="2803290" d="3360">they’re things we can use and things that
get in our way.</p>
<p t="2806650" d="3800">That’s a theory that was derived originally
from J.J.</p>
<p t="2810450" d="6490">Gibson, who wrote a great book on that called
The Ecological Approach to Visual Perception,</p>
<p t="2816940" d="3400">and his science was a brand of pragmatism.</p>
<p t="2820340" d="6150">Pragmatists basically claim that things including
theories and perceptions have a limited range</p>
<p t="2826490" d="7850">of truth, and the limited range of truth is
determined by the match between your actions</p>
<p t="2834340" d="1000">and the outcomes.</p>
<p t="2835340" d="1710">So, I think this is a coke can.</p>
<p t="2837050" d="1510">Is that what it is?</p>
<p t="2838560" d="6370">No, but it’s good enough for me if I want
to drink a bit of coke out of it.</p>
<p t="2844930" d="2710">God only knows what it is.</p>
<p t="2847640" d="7480">If you go into Communist China and you start
advertising these things, then what are they?</p>
<p t="2855120" d="3650">This thing tells a story– what’s the story?</p>
<p t="2858770" d="2280">Really, do you need Coca Cola?</p>
<p t="2861050" d="1000">No.</p>
<p t="2862050" d="2250">It’s a bit of frippery; it’s an unnecessary
luxury.</p>
<p t="2864300" d="5640">It’s not even very good for you, but it’s
kind of fuzzy, and it’s sweet, and you get</p>
<p t="2869940" d="1150">to buy it.</p>
<p t="2871090" d="1600">Why is that?</p>
<p t="2872690" d="5270">No matter how stupid you are in your nutrition
choices, as far as our society goes, you have</p>
<p t="2877960" d="4920">the right to poison yourself in whatever way
you think best befits you.</p>
<p t="2882880" d="4780">And so, when you send this little coke can
off to communist China, this thing screams</p>
<p t="2887660" d="2620">stupid individuality all over.</p>
<p t="2890280" d="2690">And God only knows how it undermines the state.</p>
<p t="2892970" d="3500">And if you are not thinking about that, you
are not thinking.</p>
<p t="2896470" d="2660">Think about what happens when we export cars.</p>
<p t="2899130" d="2620">What does a car say?</p>
<p t="2901750" d="4810">it says “hey, you can go wherever you want
whenever you want, you don’t need to tell</p>
<p t="2906560" d="3910">anybody at all, and you can do it in a really
dangerous, high speed manner.”</p>
<p t="2910470" d="5740">It is like, you want a political statement,
wrap it up in metal and ship that thing off,</p>
<p t="2916210" d="3710">and everybody goes like “I would really
like to get one of those.”</p>
<p t="2919920" d="3520">And, puff, communism disappears with that.</p>
<p t="2923440" d="6540">There is nothing that says individuality and
capitalism like a personal automobile.</p>
<p t="2929980" d="4540">You even get to pollute the atmosphere and
ruin the planet with the damn thing, but if</p>
<p t="2934520" d="3900">you have to drive to the corner store and
pick up your damn coke, the hell with the</p>
<p t="2938420" d="4580">atmosphere.</p>
<p t="2943000" d="3771">So don’t be thinking that what appears in
front of you are only objects, because they</p>
<p t="2946771" d="1049">are not.</p>
<p t="2947820" d="5040">I started thinking about this for example
when I was thinking people going down Graceland</p>
<p t="2952860" d="2530">to look at Elvis’ guitar.</p>
<p t="2955390" d="6720">You think: what exactly is that it makes a
guitar Elvis’ guitar?</p>
<p t="2962110" d="5930">It is not exactly the guitar, because it is
just sitting there, like any object does,</p>
<p t="2968040" d="1511">and maybe you could be able to think about
it.</p>
<p t="2969551" d="4889">You could take that guitar out and put a guitar
just like it, and it would still be Elvis’</p>
<p t="2974440" d="1670">guitar because they wouldn’t know.</p>
<p t="2976110" d="4170">So you might think that this is not really
Elvis’ guitar.</p>
<p t="2980280" d="5180">That is a funny thing because you would only
think that if you thought that Elvis’ guitar</p>
<p t="2985460" d="4330">was the thing that was made out of material
that was sitting right in front of you.</p>
<p t="2989790" d="1000">And that isn’t what it is.</p>
<p t="2990790" d="2950">That is only one tiny little bit of it.</p>
<p t="2993740" d="6180">That bloody thing is a part of an incredibly
layered reality.</p>
<p t="2999920" d="4920">I mean, the people who want to go look at
that, they are looking at it in some sense</p>
<p t="3004840" d="4570">because of the magic that is emanating from
it, but the magic is actually real.</p>
<p t="3009410" d="5250">The magic is the effect of that guitar, let’s
say, on the entire culture.</p>
<p t="3014660" d="2540">And those effects are the damn guitar too.</p>
<p t="3017200" d="3630">And it is weird, because when you go look
at Elvis’ guitar, you are not looking at</p>
<p t="3020830" d="2160">the guitar, you are looking at the magic.</p>
<p t="3022990" d="3180">And, weirdly enough, the magic is actually
real.</p>
<p t="3026170" d="4050">Well, you can’t think that way if you are
a materialist, because you think the thing</p>
<p t="3030220" d="2420">is the material, it’s like “yeah, right.”</p>
<p t="3032640" d="6930">I can tell you another story: When the Americans
and Europeans came to the South Pacific Islands,</p>
<p t="3039570" d="2980">the South Pacific Islanders, because there
weren’t that many of them, they didn’t</p>
<p t="3042550" d="2960">have a highly technical society.</p>
<p t="3045510" d="7260">So, if you were like Joe, dominant guy, in
the Pacific Island culture, you might be able</p>
<p t="3052770" d="3060">to have stone ax, la well-made stone ax.</p>
<p t="3055830" d="4390">Go make a stone ax, and see how long that
takes you, that is a bit of work.</p>
<p t="3060220" d="4210">So, if you are a high status guy, if you really
worked your whole life to be at the top of</p>
<p t="3064430" d="4830">the pyramid, you maybe get two axes, it is
like a red letter day.</p>
<p t="3069260" d="5060">You’ve got two axes, which is more than
any other animal has, by a lot.</p>
<p t="3074320" d="1780">So, it is not trivial.</p>
<p t="3076100" d="6390">And then, the damn missionaries come in, and
they set up a shop, and what do they bring?</p>
<p t="3082490" d="1210">Steel axes.</p>
<p t="3083700" d="5880">That’s kind of a downer, you have worked
your whole damn life to get these stone axes,</p>
<p t="3089580" d="5130">and that makes you head tribesman, and then
your kid goes down to the local missionaries,</p>
<p t="3094710" d="4020">and they say “we have an extra steel ax
here, why don’t you take that back home”?</p>
<p t="3098730" d="4740">And it is so shocking, because not only did
the missionaries have this thing that was</p>
<p t="3103470" d="7190">so much better than the steel ax, it is like
a jet plane compared to a wheel cart, like</p>
<p t="3110660" d="2070">they are really, really different.</p>
<p t="3112730" d="4820">But the missionaries, they don’t even notice,
that is the horrible thing about t.</p>
<p t="3117550" d="4340">They give away this thing that virtually has
this infinite value, because it is okay, we</p>
<p t="3121890" d="4420">have a couple of those in the store room,
we are just willing to hand them out.</p>
<p t="3126310" d="1090">It is a little demoralizing.</p>
<p t="3127400" d="3420">It is a little demoralizing for the Pacific
Islanders.</p>
<p t="3130820" d="6270">And, so, what, was it an ax that missionaries
gave away?</p>
<p t="3137090" d="1000">It wasn’t.</p>
<p t="3138090" d="4060">You’d think that if you were a Westerner
and you’d have a bunch of axes, you would</p>
<p t="3142150" d="1250">think “yeah, right.”</p>
<p t="3143400" d="2920">It is a lot more than an ax, a lot more.</p>
<p t="3146320" d="10290">It is a weapon that can bring down a whole
culture accidentally.</p>
<p t="3156610" d="6320">One of the things that the phenomenologists
claim, this is a cool claim, I didn’t know</p>
<p t="3162930" d="1000">they claimed this.</p>
<p t="3163930" d="2790">It took me quite a long time to figure this
out, because I thought I figured it out on</p>
<p t="3166720" d="4540">my own, but it turns out that it is very difficult
to figure out anything on your own.</p>
<p t="3171260" d="4820">So, when I was doing my investigation about
how the brain works from a neuropsychological</p>
<p t="3176080" d="3730">perspective, and that was informed a lot by
Jeffrey Gray, who we are going to talk about</p>
<p t="3179810" d="6890">later, one of the things I noticed was that
you don’t actually see things when you first</p>
<p t="3186700" d="1050">see something.</p>
<p t="3187750" d="5490">In fact, when you first see something, you
don’t even see it, you react to it.</p>
<p t="3193240" d="2500">You react to it with your body.</p>
<p t="3195740" d="1910">So, I can give you an example.</p>
<p t="3197650" d="4560">So, here you have a partner and you have a
trusting relationship, and then you find out</p>
<p t="3202210" d="3730">that, they tell you or you figure out from
their phone or something, they are having</p>
<p t="3205940" d="1270">an affair.</p>
<p t="3207210" d="4770">And you look at them, and you think: what
do you see?</p>
<p t="3211980" d="6620">No, you don’t, you do not see the person,
that is wrong.</p>
<p t="3218600" d="3300">What you see is a huge pit that you are going
to fall into, and you don’t even know you</p>
<p t="3221900" d="4920">see it, but your body knows, as if your blood
pressure goes through the roof and your heart</p>
<p t="3226820" d="1920">starts pounding and you sweat.</p>
<p t="3228740" d="4730">And the reason for that is: your body sees
what you can’t see and what it sees is something</p>
<p t="3233470" d="4340">that you can seriously not understand, it
does not understand it.</p>
<p t="3237810" d="6030">It sees the territory behind the map, because,
when I look at you, for all intensive purposes,</p>
<p t="3243840" d="4480">really what I am looking at is my presuppositions
about you and because you are polite and well-behaved,</p>
<p t="3248320" d="5000">you are gracious enough to act in accordance
with those presuppositions, so I don’t even</p>
<p t="3253320" d="3390">really have to look at you, and thank you
very much for that.</p>
<p t="3256710" d="5950">Because it is very difficult to look at people,
because they are horrifying and profound creatures.</p>
<p t="3262660" d="3890">And so everyone walks around behaving so we
don’t terrify the hell out of each other</p>
<p t="3266550" d="1000">all the time.</p>
<p t="3267550" d="4050">Now, when someone betrays you, it is like
poof, presuppositions gone.</p>
<p t="3271600" d="2090">Okay, what is there?</p>
<p t="3273690" d="2660">God only knows.</p>
<p t="3276350" d="1850">And that is what your body reacts to.</p>
<p t="3278200" d="6490">And that is partly why the phenomenologists
said that we react to meaning first, we don’t</p>
<p t="3284690" d="1000">react to objects.</p>
<p t="3285690" d="2390">It takes a long time to see the damn object.</p>
<p t="3288080" d="3690">So, for example, let’s say that this person
has betrayed you.</p>
<p t="3291770" d="4870">Now, you think you knew who they were, and
you thought you knew who you were.</p>
<p t="3296640" d="2070">Guess what, you are wrong!</p>
<p t="3298710" d="3570">You don’t know who they are, and, because
you are such a moron, it means you don’t</p>
<p t="3302280" d="4660">know who you are and that you can’t trust
any memories with that person, and maybe none</p>
<p t="3306940" d="2950">of your memories in any intimate relationships
at all.</p>
<p t="3309890" d="1860">Plus, what about the future?</p>
<p t="3311750" d="3210">Well, so, when you look at the person, what
do you see?</p>
<p t="3314960" d="1580">You see all that, like chaos.</p>
<p t="3316540" d="2120">That is what you see.</p>
<p t="3318660" d="5610">And that chaos is the meaning behind your
presuppositions and that is why the phenomenologists</p>
<p t="3324270" d="2670">would say: meaning shines forth.</p>
<p t="3326940" d="3830">And that is the primary thing we encounter.</p>
<p t="3330770" d="2190">It is like: that is smart.</p>
<p t="3332960" d="1590">And you know what is really weird?</p>
<p t="3334550" d="2030">That is how your damn brain is organized.</p>
<p t="3336580" d="5790">And that is weird because you, let’s think
about it: how do you define reality?</p>
<p t="3342370" d="3590">Now, that is a tough one.</p>
<p t="3345960" d="5140">I would say most of you define reality like
you are Isaac Newton.</p>
<p t="3351100" d="5170">Or maybe you are like Democrates, who was
the first person who hypothesized atoms.</p>
<p t="3356270" d="5190">And so, in a Newtonian world, it is like a
billiard ball, everything is made out of billiard</p>
<p t="3361460" d="4750">balls and they bang together in a causal way
and you can predict the consequences of their</p>
<p t="3366210" d="4830">banging together, and, if you extend it enough,
you can conjure up an entirely deterministic</p>
<p t="3371040" d="1000">world.</p>
<p t="3372040" d="6340">A happens, causes B, B causes C, always the
same way, and everything runs like a giant</p>
<p t="3378380" d="1000">clock.</p>
<p t="3379380" d="1340">That is Newton’s model.</p>
<p t="3380720" d="4170">And it was a clock model, because, back at
that time, clocks, those things were pretty</p>
<p t="3384890" d="1700">damn impressive.</p>
<p t="3386590" d="3920">Clocks got the whole industrial revolution
on their way, and medieval cities were put</p>
<p t="3390510" d="4090">an awful lot time and work into their clocks
and they thought those damn things were really</p>
<p t="3394600" d="1120">cool.</p>
<p t="3395720" d="3290">They could keep track of where the planets
were moving.</p>
<p t="3399010" d="3740">That is a big deal, a clock, and if you want
to think about an invention that changed the</p>
<p t="3402750" d="1800">world, it is like, the clock is a big one.</p>
<p t="3404550" d="2260">Now, we can measure time.</p>
<p t="3406810" d="2290">In the same way, everyone can measure time.</p>
<p t="3409100" d="5400">It is a big deal, so the idea that the universe
is like a clock, given that the clock can</p>
<p t="3414500" d="3330">predict the universe, it is a pretty damn
powerful idea.</p>
<p t="3417830" d="5910">It turns out that it is wrong, because, causality
is a mess, no one really understands it, and</p>
<p t="3423740" d="4601">there are levels of analysis at which causality,
in the way we experience it, doesn’t seem</p>
<p t="3428341" d="1719">to apply at all.</p>
<p t="3430060" d="4060">You go down to the subatomic level, it is
probabilistic, you can’t predict single</p>
<p t="3434120" d="3190">events and I don’t believe that you can
predict the future.</p>
<p t="3437310" d="4380">You can predict parts of the future in an
extremely limited way, for some purposes,</p>
<p t="3441690" d="4990">for some span of time, and you can’t even
predict how long that span of time is going</p>
<p t="3446680" d="1420">to last.</p>
<p t="3448100" d="4790">And some things seem to be more stable, across
more situations, and across more times than</p>
<p t="3452890" d="4700">others, but they are still…there is instability
everywhere, it makes the predicting thing</p>
<p t="3457590" d="2080">a very difficult thing to do.</p>
<p t="3459670" d="6810">So, that is one idea about reality, that is
the idea really that you have, and that is</p>
<p t="3466480" d="3080">the reality that you have been educated to
have.</p>
<p t="3469560" d="2280">The idea of reality that you have been educated
to have.</p>
<p t="3471840" d="5610">Even though we know it’s wrong, Einstein
blew that world up in the early 1900s, along</p>
<p t="3477450" d="2669">with the various people that Einstein depended
on.</p>
<p t="3480119" d="4301">That’s gone, it’s wrong, and then there
are all sorts of other extremely complicated</p>
<p t="3484420" d="5189">problems like how to model positive feedback
loops, that sort of gets you into chaos theory,</p>
<p t="3489609" d="3021">and it’s really hard to model positive feedback
loops.</p>
<p t="3492630" d="4100">They can go wild in 50 different ways you
can’t really and predict them as they depend</p>
<p t="3496730" d="2250">on initial conditions.</p>
<p t="3498980" d="5210">So, the deterministic world is like no, that’s
wrong.</p>
<p t="3504190" d="4669">I think part of the reason we have to have
free-will is because we can’t act deterministically.</p>
<p t="3508859" d="5711">A deterministic system is only going to work
in a system that stays the same.</p>
<p t="3514570" d="5830">So, you can wind up a little clock, one of
the little clockwork toys and it’ll walk.</p>
<p t="3520400" d="3610">But if you put a cliff in front of it, it
just walks off the cliff.</p>
<p t="3524010" d="3790">So when cliffs are appearing in front of us
randomly all the time, I can’t even see</p>
<p t="3527800" d="3230">how a deterministic system could possibly
work to guide us.</p>
<p t="3531030" d="4970">It would assume that our knowledge, the knowledge
that we derive from the past is sufficiently</p>
<p t="3536000" d="2590">accurate to causally guide us into the future.</p>
<p t="3538590" d="5810">It’s like no, that’s not right; it doesn’t,
so maybe that’s why we have consciousness.</p>
<p t="3544400" d="3430">No one knows that that’s a good theory if
there’s a why.</p>
<p t="3547830" d="6380">Anyways, here’s an alternative, this is
a Darwinian alternative, so the alternative</p>
<p t="3554210" d="4370">is that the world’s a complex and dynamic
place.</p>
<p t="3558580" d="2870">It’s full of weird things.</p>
<p t="3561450" d="8141">Basically it is made up of patterns and patterns
and patterns, that’s what it is, and they</p>
<p t="3569591" d="1989">shift and dance around.</p>
<p t="3571580" d="3230">Then you throw something that’s alive in
to that.</p>
<p t="3574810" d="5500">It’s programmed by DNA and it has to keep
up with patterns and they’re changing all</p>
<p t="3580310" d="1000">the time.</p>
<p t="3581310" d="3180">Some of them are kind of stable but they’re
pretty fluid.</p>
<p t="3584490" d="6940">Then you throw the DNA in there and it produces
a million variants of whatever it is going</p>
<p t="3591430" d="1000">to produce.</p>
<p t="3592430" d="1000">Most of them are wrong.</p>
<p t="3593430" d="1100">You’re a mosquito and you lay a million
eggs.</p>
<p t="3594530" d="9850">So, that’s a million bets about how the
future will causally unfold and the bet is</p>
<p t="3604380" d="2670">the future’s going to unfold so this egg
can turn into a mosquito.</p>
<p t="3607050" d="4240">Then you might say, how often is the mosquito
that lays the eggs wrong?</p>
<p t="3611290" d="5569">The answer to that is if it lays a million
eggs in its lifetime, I don’t know how many</p>
<p t="3616859" d="7381">eggs mosquitoes lay but they lay a lot, all
of those eggs are going to die except one</p>
<p t="3624240" d="1650">if the mosquito is lucky.</p>
<p t="3625890" d="3190">You know that because we are not knee deep
in mosquitoes.</p>
<p t="3629080" d="3970">If it wasn’t the case, there would be mosquitoes
everywhere, but there aren’t thankfully.</p>
<p t="3633050" d="4309">So, basically what’s the bet?</p>
<p t="3637359" d="3861">The bet is that mosquitoes match their environment.</p>
<p t="3641220" d="3350">The answer is wrong except once in a million.</p>
<p t="3644570" d="1430">So how do you overcome that?</p>
<p t="3646000" d="2960">Million mosquitoes, million eggs and it’ll
do the trick.</p>
<p t="3648960" d="7180">It means that the fundamental hypothesis that
the mosquito structure matches the structure</p>
<p t="3656140" d="10890">of reality is wrong at a one in a million,
a 999 999 level of error.</p>
<p t="3667030" d="6100">You might just think that’s just completely
wrong, but it keeps the mosquitoes going.</p>
<p t="3673130" d="6361">So then, this propagates across time, and
what really propagates across time is really</p>
<p t="3679491" d="2219">a massive wave of death.</p>
<p t="3681710" d="5250">Virtually everything fails, 99.9% of the species
that ever lived are extinct.</p>
<p t="3686960" d="4920">We are doing a fair good job of making sure
that a good chunk of the ones that exist now</p>
<p t="3691880" d="1810">are going to go extinct.</p>
<p t="3693690" d="5290">Failure and death is the norm and it’s going
to happen to all of you.</p>
<p t="3698980" d="11060">So if the underlying structure of reality
is mutable, which it is and the only way that</p>
<p t="3710040" d="5620">you can adapt to it is by generating variance
and having most of them perish, except for</p>
<p t="3715660" d="4670">the ones that manage more or less by chance
to keep up how do you define real.</p>
<p t="3720330" d="10160">A Darwinist would say, as well as a Pragmatist,
you embody real to the best degree that real</p>
<p t="3730490" d="1550">can be attained.</p>
<p t="3732040" d="2260">It’s not very good.</p>
<p t="3734300" d="3400">Your real is good enough for about 80 years.</p>
<p t="3737700" d="4250">They say that it’s as real as it gets.</p>
<p t="3741950" d="8250">Reality is so complicated, this multilayered
pattern array that you can’t even model</p>
<p t="3750200" d="3840">without using death as the mechanism.</p>
<p t="3754040" d="5840">You can’t do it and even if you do use death,
it is almost all death.</p>
<p t="3759880" d="4660">Even for the parts that aren’t all death
which is hardly any of it, the solution isn’t</p>
<p t="3764540" d="1380">that good.</p>
<p t="3765920" d="4610">You are going to wear out in 80 years and
you’ve got 3 billion years of trying behind</p>
<p t="3770530" d="1350">you and that’s the best you can do.</p>
<p t="3771880" d="7420">Maybe if you’re a parrot, you can get 150
and apparently there’s an immortal jellyfish,</p>
<p t="3779300" d="2750">figures it wold be a jellyfish that would
be immortal.</p>
<p t="3782050" d="4850">So, there’s a whole different way about
thinking about real.</p>
<p t="3786900" d="5110">Neches said life is truth, truth serves life,
and that’s a Darwinian idea.</p>
<p t="3792010" d="5770">Although he didn’t take it from Darwin,
there isn’t anything truer than what evolution</p>
<p t="3797780" d="2600">reveals as the model for reality.</p>
<p t="3800380" d="2660">That’s as true as it gets for us.</p>
<p t="3803040" d="2510">That’s not a Newtonian reality.</p>
<p t="3805550" d="7580">It’s a multilevel, patterned, chaotic reality
that we’re trying to keep up with.</p>
<p t="3813130" d="11200">So what that might mean is that the implications
for actions that I derive from that phenomenon</p>
<p t="3824330" d="8890">might be more indicative of what it is than
an objective analysis because your truth,</p>
<p t="3833220" d="5700">the degree to which you embody truth, is so
far as it can be determined with a Darwinian</p>
<p t="3838920" d="5970">framework is entirely measured by your success
in living and propagating.</p>
<p t="3844890" d="3690">That’s it and there isn’t anything under
that.</p>
<p t="3848580" d="2810">Maybe there is but if you’re a Darwinian
that’s it.</p>
<p t="3851390" d="5120">I think Darwin is right all things considered
and newton is wrong plus we also know that</p>
<p t="3856510" d="1630">Newton is wrong.</p>
<p t="3858140" d="5170">The whole Darwinian thing is more complicated
than we thought because, you know what epigenetics</p>
<p t="3863310" d="1000">are?</p>
<p t="3864310" d="1690">How many of you know about that?</p>
<p t="3866000" d="6060">That’s pretty good, so your biological education
demolishes your historical education.</p>
<p t="3872060" d="2150">How many people don’t know what epigenetics
is?</p>
<p t="3874210" d="2310">It’s okay as it is relatively new.</p>
<p t="3876520" d="5210">Anyways, it turns out that your parent’s
experience can alter their genetic structure</p>
<p t="3881730" d="3380">in such a way that it alters your genetic
structure.</p>
<p t="3885110" d="3860">That’s something we didn’t expect, that’s
for sure.</p>
<p t="3888970" d="4889">Nobody knows what the final consequence of
that will be but it looks like there’s more</p>
<p t="3893859" d="5911">to the evolutionary story than near random
production and natural selection.</p>
<p t="3899770" d="3240">There’s more to it than that, who know how
much.</p>
<p t="3903010" d="8550">So, when the phenomenologists say we react
to meaning first, that opens a question, is</p>
<p t="3911560" d="1400">the meaning real?</p>
<p t="3912960" d="5290">And that opens up another question, which
is what do you mean by real and that opens</p>
<p t="3918250" d="4840">another question, is it Newton real or Darwin
real?</p>
<p t="3923090" d="7080">Well Newton is wrong, so that leaves Darwin
and Darwin real, that’s about as real as</p>
<p t="3930170" d="4030">it gets.</p>
<p t="3934200" d="5830">If a partial entity is trying to model a complex
totality, all they are ever going to be able</p>
<p t="3940030" d="4201">to do is embody a partial representation of
that and it’s not going to be that good</p>
<p t="3944231" d="6299">but it’s going to be as good as they can
get, as that’s as true as it can get.</p>
<p t="3950530" d="4450">So the phenomenologists, they have this weird
idea that we perceive meaning.</p>
<p t="3954980" d="3320">Guess what, that’s how you brain is set
up.</p>
<p t="3958300" d="4040">You first perceive meaning, and then with
a lot of work you turn that into an object</p>
<p t="3962340" d="1490">perception.</p>
<p t="3963830" d="3810">God only knows how much exploration you have
to do before you do that.</p>
<p t="3967640" d="6970">How long do you think it takes a child to
handle its soother before it builds up an</p>
<p t="3974610" d="2620">accurate representation of the soother?</p>
<p t="3977230" d="4830">It is going to be chewing on that thing like
mad, taking it out, checking it out, turning</p>
<p t="3982060" d="2260">it around and banging it against things.</p>
<p t="3984320" d="5020">It has to do all that including the tactile
interactions.</p>
<p t="3989340" d="4360">The experimentation with the thing across
situations establishes object permanence.</p>
<p t="3993700" d="4860">It has to do all that before it can see the
thing.</p>
<p t="3998560" d="9170">Early eye researchers who were under the influence
of behaviourists basically said that the object</p>
<p t="4007730" d="4010">is given so they can treat the brain like
it doesn’t exist.</p>
<p t="4011740" d="2520">The object is just there and you can just
see the world.</p>
<p t="4014260" d="2150">Well that turned out to be seriously wrong.</p>
<p t="4016410" d="2910">It is difficult to get a computer to see the
world.</p>
<p t="4019320" d="4700">It turns out you have to put them inside bodies
before they could really do it because you</p>
<p t="4024020" d="3620">really can’t perceive the world without
a body.</p>
<p t="4027640" d="3240">Perception is for bodily action.</p>
<p t="4030880" d="5070">Without the framework within which, really
what you’re doing is a Piagetian idea.</p>
<p t="4035950" d="6650">This is a pattern; this thing and the pattern
exist at multiple levels including the advertising</p>
<p t="4042600" d="4510">level, your memories of coke and all the jingles
you know.</p>
<p t="4047110" d="5790">But this, when I look at that, I map its pattern
onto my retina and the pattern is a pattern</p>
<p t="4052900" d="1770">because it’s extending across time.</p>
<p t="4054670" d="2920">It’s not like smoke which is dissipating.</p>
<p t="4057590" d="2110">It’s staying there across time.</p>
<p t="4059700" d="4470">I map that onto my retina and then the retina
matches it onto my hand.</p>
<p t="4064170" d="2250">That’s the coke can.</p>
<p t="4066420" d="5830">The coke can is all of this.</p>
<p t="4072250" d="2940">And you might say that’s not what it is
because it is made of aluminum.</p>
<p t="4075190" d="5670">“Yeah, yeah it’s made out of aluminum”,
but that is only one part of what it is and</p>
<p t="4080860" d="1000">it’s not necessarily even the most important
part.</p>
<p t="4081860" d="1000">That’s only one part of what it is.</p>
<p t="4082860" d="1600">And it’s not necessarily even the most important
part because it could be made out of plastic</p>
<p t="4084460" d="4139">and what difference would that make?</p>
<p t="4088599" d="4581">It’s pretty weird when you start to think
about it.</p>
<p t="4093180" d="4050">People make the claim that meaning is epiphenomenal,
as if there is no real meaning and the universe</p>
<p t="4097230" d="6839">is this dead thing, and if we all went instinct
tomorrow, there would just be a bunch of meaningless</p>
<p t="4104069" d="2701">marbles rotating in space.</p>
<p t="4106770" d="3640">First of all, even this is not true because
we cannot know what is out there if there</p>
<p t="4110410" d="1869">is nothing to perceive it.</p>
<p t="4112279" d="6540">The physicists tell us it is more like vast
potential fluctuating quantum fields and maybe</p>
<p t="4118819" d="5001">it doesn’t even turn into stars and planets
until there is someone to look at it.</p>
<p t="4123820" d="3700">You may think that’s ridiculous but if you
think about it for a while, you’ll see that</p>
<p t="4127520" d="2250">there’s really something to it.</p>
<p t="4129770" d="3960">You are the thing that specifies the level
of analysis.</p>
<p t="4133730" d="4910">With the way you look at the world, you don’t
see the atoms, you don’t see the sub-atomic</p>
<p t="4138640" d="2030">particles, and you don’t see the little
rocks.</p>
<p t="4140670" d="4700">You see planet-sized things when you look
out into space, and you see it at a particular</p>
<p t="4145370" d="2469">slice of time.</p>
<p t="4147839" d="6241">Maybe your refresh rate is something like
60 hertz, so what you see is the universe</p>
<p t="4154080" d="4590">sliced into 60-hert-slices and you think that’s
real.</p>
<p t="4158670" d="6290">But so is all the rest of it, including its
huge expansive time, from beginning to end.</p>
<p t="4164960" d="4140">You don’t see any of that, but it’s there.</p>
<p t="4169100" d="2130">All those things are there at the same time.</p>
<p t="4171230" d="2020">What does all that add up to?</p>
<p t="4173250" d="5540">The physicists seem to tell us it adds up
to a pool of quantum potential that isn’t</p>
<p t="4178790" d="4580">realized until there is something conscious
that interacts with it.</p>
<p t="4183370" d="7150">Now, you’ve got your meaning shining forth
like math and part of the reason children</p>
<p t="4190520" d="4740">are so attractive is because for them, the
meaning is just shining at them like math.</p>
<p t="4195260" d="2770">That’s why they are always wandering around
like this [looks around in wonder].</p>
<p t="4198030" d="4740">It’s really fun to watch kids because they
give you a taste of that again.</p>
<p t="4202770" d="2050">Kids have to pay you so you don’t throw
them out the window.</p>
<p t="4204820" d="3650">They’re very annoying; they’re always
crying, they’re completely useless, they</p>
<p t="4208470" d="3820">just lay there and don’t do anything, and
they wake you up at three in the morning to</p>
<p t="4212290" d="2340">annoy you.</p>
<p t="4214630" d="2880">Because you’re selfish and mean, you need
something in return.</p>
<p t="4217510" d="1490">So they smile at you.</p>
<p t="4219000" d="1630">But they do other things as well.</p>
<p t="4220630" d="4859">They’re really [x6] comical so they’re
a blast to watch and play with.</p>
<p t="4225489" d="4911">But one of the things they really do is they
remove the blinders from you while you’re</p>
<p t="4230400" d="1000">around them.</p>
<p t="4231400" d="4080">You go out in a forest with a two and a half
year old and it’s very annoying.</p>
<p t="4235480" d="2660">The bloody thing just wanders around randomly.</p>
<p t="4238140" d="3000">You’ve got no goal direction.</p>
<p t="4241140" d="3470">Nothing goal-directed is going to happen with
a two and a half year old, but that’s kind</p>
<p t="4244610" d="3950">of cool because it frees your mind from your
goal-directed narrowness.</p>
<p t="4248560" d="2900">You can watch the two year old look at all
these things that you haven’t looked at</p>
<p t="4251460" d="2990">for twenty years because you’ve already
looked at them once and you just have to see</p>
<p t="4254450" d="1300">your memory.</p>
<p t="4255750" d="2530">And then you think “wow that really is cool”.</p>
<p t="4258280" d="3180">They’ll bring you something and they’ll
tell you it’s cool.</p>
<p t="4261460" d="3110">Maybe it’s a shiny piece of aluminum or
gum wrapper.</p>
<p t="4264570" d="4380">You think it’s a gum wrapper because that’s
what you see when you look at it; you’ve</p>
<p t="4268950" d="3890">already built a gum wrapper representation
and you just lay this on that.</p>
<p t="4272840" d="1530">That isn’t what the kid sees.</p>
<p t="4274370" d="2310">God only knows what they’re looking at.</p>
<p t="4276680" d="4390">Maybe how the light reflects off the aluminum
prismatically and how it glitters, or how</p>
<p t="4281070" d="3320">cool it is that it can be folded up and how
light it is.</p>
<p t="4284390" d="3091">They are looking at it like this [makes wide-eyed
expression], and I think it’s because their</p>
<p t="4287481" d="4159">cortex isn’t very well developed and they
haven’t built the inhibitory structures</p>
<p t="4291640" d="4340">that stop them from seeing meaning shining
forth.</p>
<p t="4295980" d="2530">You might think “is there any evidence for
that?”</p>
<p t="4298510" d="5220">There actually is quite a bit of evidence
for that.</p>
<p t="4303730" d="4910">One piece of evidence is that if you take
a cat’s brain out and you leave it with</p>
<p t="4308640" d="4490">just a hypothalamus and a spinal cord, it
is hyper-exploratory; it runs around like</p>
<p t="4313130" d="1330">everything is interesting.</p>
<p t="4314460" d="3290">It is weird behaviour for a thing that doesn’t
have a brain.</p>
<p t="4317750" d="4610">You would think that once you don’t have
a brain, nothing would be interesting.</p>
<p t="4322360" d="2520">It depends on how much of your brain you have.</p>
<p t="4324880" d="1970">There are people who have experienced that.</p>
<p t="4326850" d="5610">There was a famous case of a conductor who
had a very serious brain injury.</p>
<p t="4332460" d="5390">It basically blew out his hippocampus so he
could not put any more information from short-term</p>
<p t="4337850" d="2110">attention to long-term storage.</p>
<p t="4339960" d="6940">He wrote these articles, these massive multi-page-long
journals.</p>
<p t="4346900" d="9610">All he would write is “it’s as if I’m
seeing everything for the first time”, over</p>
<p t="4356510" d="1000">and over.</p>
<p t="4357510" d="1690">He was wandering around in a constant state
of awe.</p>
<p t="4359200" d="1530">His wife would come to visit him.</p>
<p t="4360730" d="2080">He couldn’t remember any of the things that
had happened to him.</p>
<p t="4362810" d="4480">He would be blown out of the water to see
her because he didn’t see his memories.</p>
<p t="4367290" d="3420">He would say “it’s just like I’m seeing
you for the first time”.</p>
<p t="4370710" d="3570">And he was; he was seeing her for the first
time.</p>
<p t="4374280" d="4690">The access to the inhibitory structures that
were directing his attention was gone.</p>
<p t="4378970" d="4200">He was an interesting case because now and
then, he would sit down to play the piano.</p>
<p t="4383170" d="6190">He’d have an epileptic seizure and then
he could play just like he used to play.</p>
<p t="4389360" d="4040">It was as if he had to switch brain modes
and the mechanism for switching was damage.</p>
<p t="4393400" d="5130">He would have to have a little seizure and
then he could lay out these Beethoven Sonatas</p>
<p t="4398530" d="1430">like a mad dog.</p>
<p t="4399960" d="4029">At the end, he would have a little seizure
and come back to “it’s as if I’m seeing</p>
<p t="4403989" d="2301">everything for the first time”.</p>
<p t="4406290" d="4780">I think part of the reason psychedelic drugs
proved so attractive to people in the 60s</p>
<p t="4411070" d="4970">and to people since the beginning of time
is because in some sense, that is what they</p>
<p t="4416040" d="1000">do.</p>
<p t="4417040" d="3310">With a poof, your memory representations are
gone.</p>
<p t="4420350" d="1440">Now what are you seeing?</p>
<p t="4421790" d="3210">God only knows, but it is not what you expect.</p>
<p t="4425000" d="10170">And perhaps it is what’s there, but maybe
not.</p>
<p t="4435170" d="14870">I’m going to sum this up a little bit.</p>
<p t="4450040" d="3199">What do you think drives people to extreme
forms of pathology?</p>
<p t="4453239" d="4051">This may be your pathology: your misery, your
suffering, and all that.</p>
<p t="4457290" d="8270">Or it may be your social psychopathology,
which is your murderous desire to exterminate.</p>
<p t="4465560" d="7170">Here is a phenomenological theory.</p>
<p t="4472730" d="3520">The terror management theory is that you must
build these structures in your head to get</p>
<p t="4476250" d="4180">yourself away from death anxiety, so really
what the terror management people are saying</p>
<p t="4480430" d="2880">is that the blinder you are, the better off
you are.</p>
<p t="4483310" d="3070">That’s what the positive illusion people
think too.</p>
<p t="4486380" d="2560">The phenomenologists were going at this from
another direction.</p>
<p t="4488940" d="6230">They were saying that the meaning that constantly
reveals itself is nourishing and revitalizing,</p>
<p t="4495170" d="3920">although it’s so powerful that it can just
blow you apart.</p>
<p t="4499090" d="1940">It is a dangerous thing to be messing with.</p>
<p t="4501030" d="3690">It’s like the burning bush.</p>
<p t="4504720" d="3120">You have to build this structure in order
to be able to cope with that because you have</p>
<p t="4507840" d="2750">to minimize it to what you can handle.</p>
<p t="4510590" d="5920">But you need to build this structure properly
and carefully so that the meaning that reveals</p>
<p t="4516510" d="6390">itself can be shaped by you into a world,
conceptual and practical, that allows the</p>
<p t="4522900" d="6100">remaining meaning to shine through in a way
that you find sufficiently revitalizing so</p>
<p t="4529000" d="4250">that you don’t become corrupt enough to
become genocidal.</p>
<p t="4533250" d="5880">That’s a good theory and that’s what the
phenomenologists were on about.</p>
<p t="4539130" d="7000">That’s part of the reason why the existentialists
and the phenomenologists both say “don’t</p>
<p t="4546130" d="4610">deceive yourself about what manifests itself
to you.</p>
<p t="4550740" d="2979">Don’t use language instrumentally”.</p>
<p t="4553719" d="1541">Why?</p>
<p t="4555260" d="5890">Because if you do that and twist up the structures
that you are using to interpret the world</p>
<p t="4561150" d="6530">through, the world will twist up on you and
all that will be revealed is its horror.</p>
<p t="4567680" d="7470">And if horror is all that is always being
revealed to you, you will not stay good because</p>
<p t="4575150" d="3569">you cannot endure that sort of pressure.</p>
<p t="4578719" d="4471">You will get bitter and resentful.</p>
<p t="4583190" d="5080">Everything will fall apart around you because
you’re not actually modeling the reality</p>
<p t="4588270" d="2420">in a way in which positive meaning can shine
through.</p>
<p t="4590690" d="2760">You will fail and become resentful.</p>
<p t="4593450" d="1650">And you will become bitter.</p>
<p t="4595100" d="4690">Then you’ll be looking for someone to hurt
and you’ll have plenty of justification</p>
<p t="4599790" d="2460">for it.</p>
<p t="4602250" d="5940">And worse, and this is Jungian contribution
to this idea, this won’t happen all at once,</p>
<p t="4608190" d="4900">it’ll happen as a consequence of a hundred
thousand micro-decisions that you hardly even</p>
<p t="4613090" d="5960">notice, where you can be truthful about something
or not in this tiny way that hardly even seems</p>
<p t="4619050" d="1370">to matter.</p>
<p t="4620420" d="5730">But the consequence of iterating that across
time, say three hundred decisions, is that</p>
<p t="4626150" d="5190">you can build yourself into the sort of monster
that you would never want to see in the mirror.</p>
<p t="4631340" d="3460">And one of the things the phenomenologists
would also tell you, and this is something</p>
<p t="4634800" d="6000">Jung said as well, is “that is the sort
of monster that you probably are”.</p>
<p t="4640800" d="5000">If you want to deal with that, you have to
start taking things seriously.</p>
<p t="4645800" d="3960">There are two things you have to take seriously.</p>
<p t="4649760" d="8479">One is the meaning that reveals itself to
you and the other is the stance of truth that</p>
<p t="4658239" d="3291">you adopt while you’re interacting with
that meaning.</p>
<p t="4661530" d="5580">The final consequence of that would be that
your health, the health of your family and</p>
<p t="4667110" d="9070">your society, and the health of the entire
society at large pivots on that.</p>
<p t="4676180" d="4020">The way the world moves is the sum total of
the decisions that all of us are making, all</p>
<p t="4680200" d="1530">those little micro-decisions.</p>
<p t="4681730" d="6440">Those things echo like ripples in a pond so
when you do some little crooked thing that</p>
<p t="4688170" d="4960">you know you should not be doing, you are
actually warping the entire structure of reality.</p>
<p t="4693130" d="5620">And what’s really interesting about that
is now we know what happens when you do that.</p>
<p t="4698750" d="4680">What happens is we end up with the Nazis and
the communists and the hydrogen bombs.</p>
<p t="4703430" d="3030">And we haven’t escaped from that yet.</p>
<p t="4706460" d="4660">Hopefully we will, but we won’t if people
don’t learn what the 20th century had to</p>
<p t="4711120" d="5610">teach them.</p>
