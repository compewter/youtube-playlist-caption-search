<p t="9080" d="5460">So momentarily we're going to return to
the basic story.</p>
<p t="14540" d="6010">I want to talk to you today about how your
brain organizes your perceptions, and then</p>
<p t="20550" d="2210">I want to talk to you about how that's represented
in mythology.</p>
<p t="22760" d="8960">The first thing I'd like to point out, is
we talked about the difference between Darwinian</p>
<p t="31720" d="9159">and Newtonian viewpoints a while back.</p>
<p t="40879" d="4420">One claim that you might make if you were
Darwinian is that whatever your brain is adapted</p>
<p t="45299" d="3821">to is reality.</p>
<p t="49120" d="8600">That seems to be the central claim of Darwinian
evolution, is that you can't define reality</p>
<p t="57720" d="5659">any more accurately than that which selects.</p>
<p t="63379" d="5441">I want to tell you about how I think the brain
is organized.</p>
<p t="68820" d="7830">Then I want to show you, I hope, that the
way fundamental narratives work can be mapped</p>
<p t="76650" d="2690">on to that brain structure.</p>
<p t="79340" d="7280">To me that implies that there's something
right about fundamental narratives, because</p>
<p t="86620" d="6540">otherwise why would they map onto the brain
structures that have evolved to adapt us to</p>
<p t="93160" d="3800">the environment?</p>
<p t="96960" d="6530">People think about reality in objective terms,
and they think about it as decomposable into</p>
<p t="103490" d="3820">tiny subunits.</p>
<p t="107310" d="3690">I think that's a limited viewpoint, a powerful
but limited viewpoint.</p>
<p t="111000" d="9229">I think it's much more realistic to assume
that whatever reality is, is more like a continual</p>
<p t="120229" d="3961">interplay of very, very complex patterns.</p>
<p t="124190" d="6700">I suppose you could make the case that those
patterns are ultimately made out of particles,</p>
<p t="130890" d="5950">but even that's not exactly true because
the particles have to be arrayed in space.</p>
<p t="136840" d="5550">That's part of the atomic theory is that
there's not just subatomic particles and</p>
<p t="142390" d="3640">atomic particles, but that they're arrayed
in space.</p>
<p t="146030" d="4070">If they're arrayed in space, that means
the manner in which they're arrayed can</p>
<p t="150100" d="1000">be informative.</p>
<p t="151100" d="7380">And if you reduce the phenoma to the particle,
without taking into account the patterning</p>
<p t="158480" d="4420">of array of the particles, then there are
levels and levels and levels of information</p>
<p t="162900" d="3230">that you lose.</p>
<p t="166130" d="6710">Those levels of information are – they may
not be relevant for our physical understanding</p>
<p t="172840" d="4650">of the make-up of atomic and subatomic particles,
but they're definitely relevant to whether</p>
<p t="177490" d="2860">we can walk across the street safely.</p>
<p t="180350" d="7670">I would say if you're related to reality
properly, the kind of information that you're</p>
<p t="188020" d="4560">processing is precisely the kind of information
that allows you to cross the street properly;</p>
<p t="192580" d="4330">and to do all the other things during your
days, your weeks, your months that you have</p>
<p t="196910" d="5620">to in order to stay alive and fundamentally,
in some sense, propagate.</p>
<p t="202530" d="3660">Alright, so we'll start with the neuropsychological
argument.</p>
<p t="206190" d="6740">Now we've already established the idea that
these little frames of reference, or maps,</p>
<p t="212930" d="7480">or stories, or whatever you call them – I'll
call them stories from hereon in, are little</p>
<p t="220410" d="1950">gold-directed units.</p>
<p t="222360" d="5209">They're units of conception and emotion
and perception and behavior; they're little</p>
<p t="227569" d="2601">sub-personalities.</p>
<p t="230170" d="5880">The sub-personality has an initial starting
point and a destination point, and then it</p>
<p t="236050" d="5189">implements behaviors to transform the starting
point into the destination point.</p>
<p t="241239" d="3911">Then you might say, well what forms these
little sub-personalities?</p>
<p t="245150" d="6280">The answer to that is very complex, but one
answer is: fundamental motivations.</p>
<p t="251430" d="8970">I arranged the fundamental motivations on
this particular diagram pointing out that</p>
<p t="260400" d="6220">you can roughly consider motivations, as those
that maintain you, and those that propagate</p>
<p t="266620" d="1000">you.</p>
<p t="267620" d="4650">Now it's just a heuristic, it's just a
way of thinking about it.</p>
<p t="272270" d="4470">Under self-maintenance there's thermal regulation,
thirst, hunger and elimination, and there's</p>
<p t="276740" d="3149">all sorts of other things as well, but those
will do for the time being.</p>
<p t="279889" d="3861">Under self-propagation there's affiliative
desire and sexual desire.</p>
<p t="283750" d="8919">The things that's quite interesting about
all of this is that there are brain structures</p>
<p t="292669" d="5280">that underlie the manifestation of these fundamental
sub-personalities.</p>
<p t="297949" d="5671">Now people tend to think about them either
as motivations or emotions, and I think that's</p>
<p t="303620" d="1789">another useful heuristic.</p>
<p t="305409" d="4690">You can say that, roughly speaking, that a
motivation pops up an entire frame of reference</p>
<p t="310099" d="4000">and emotion tends to orient you within that
frame of reference.</p>
<p t="314099" d="6611">But that's only a conceptual simplification,
because what you see when look at the actual</p>
<p t="320710" d="6989">brain structures is that there isn't an
emotion center – there are a bunch of micro-units</p>
<p t="327699" d="7871">in the brain, and there are separable micro-units
for different emotions and different motivations</p>
<p t="335570" d="5240">and they don't necessarily have that much
in common in terms of their locale, except</p>
<p t="340810" d="2849">that they tend to be relatively deep in the
brain.</p>
<p t="343659" d="4141">Some are hypothalamic and some are in the
amygdala, and some are in the periaqueductal</p>
<p t="347800" d="2780">grey, which seems to be responsible for pain
responses.</p>
<p t="350580" d="4950">So we can classify things as motivations and
emotions, but it doesn't map one-to-one</p>
<p t="355530" d="3580">on the underlying brain structure.</p>
<p t="359110" d="4519">Now I think what we'll do with regards to
talking about the brain is we'll start from</p>
<p t="363629" d="1030">the bottom up.</p>
<p t="364659" d="5021">It's appropriate to start from the bottom
up because you are more dependent on your</p>
<p t="369680" d="6069">ancient brain structures than you are on your
modern brain structures; in that, if you damage</p>
<p t="375749" d="4301">your modern brain structures, and I mean relatively
modern, let's say the ones that have really</p>
<p t="380050" d="5519">evolved in great detail over the last two
million years, the cortical cap, in particular,</p>
<p t="385569" d="3130">the prefrontal cortex, a lot of the visual
cortex.</p>
<p t="388699" d="2541">If you damage that you can pretty much go
on.</p>
<p t="391240" d="3659">Now you're going to have one impairment
or another impairment, but you can still stay</p>
<p t="394899" d="1000">alive.</p>
<p t="395899" d="4200">However, there are structures that are lower
down that if you damage, that's the end</p>
<p t="400099" d="1000">of you.</p>
<p t="401099" d="4120">So for example, the ascending reticular activating
system, which is the thing that wakes you</p>
<p t="405219" d="4720">up when you're asleep at night, when a noise
occurs that shouldn't occur.</p>
<p t="409939" d="3590">It seems to be the activating center for consciousness,
whatever that means.</p>
<p t="413529" d="4690">It's way deep down in the brain, it's
way deep down at the top of the spinal cord,</p>
<p t="418219" d="1420">roughly speaking.</p>
<p t="419639" d="4260">If you twist your head in a car accident a
little bit too roughly, and you sheer off</p>
<p t="423899" d="4480">the ascending fibers, and you're in a coma
permanently, then nothing can wake you up.</p>
<p t="428379" d="5641">That's pretty interesting – to know that
consciousness, our tendency is to think about</p>
<p t="434020" d="4380">that as a function of the higher cortical
systems, is dependent completely on something</p>
<p t="438400" d="2879">that is unbelievably ancient.</p>
<p t="441279" d="6190">So it begs the question, exactly what level
of neuronal complexity do you have to be before</p>
<p t="447469" d="1470">you have sub consciousness?</p>
<p t="448939" d="3130">The answer to that is, we don't know.</p>
<p t="452069" d="4511">The relationship between consciousness and
neuronal structure is insanely complex.</p>
<p t="456580" d="8839">For example, you have very neuron-heavy structures
in your brain, like the cerebellum, which</p>
<p t="465419" d="5860">has a very rough outer-coating like the cortex,
and it has about as many neurons as the cortical</p>
<p t="471279" d="1151">sheet does.</p>
<p t="472430" d="4180">Yet, you can take it out of people and they
don't seem to show any impairment in consciousness,</p>
<p t="476610" d="3809">but they get ataxic and they can't control
their behavior that well.</p>
<p t="480419" d="4261">They have a hard time guiding it – but that
seems to be more or less it.</p>
<p t="484680" d="3560">Now it isn't, because there are other things
that the cerebellum does, but my point is</p>
<p t="488240" d="7079">that you can have massively neuron-heavy structures
that seem to be related in very minimal ways</p>
<p t="495319" d="2570">to our experience of consciousness.</p>
<p t="497889" d="3551">Your autonomic nervous system is sort of like
that – there are a lot of neurons in your</p>
<p t="501440" d="4530">autonomic nervous system, but I think it's
a mistake to say that we're precisely conscious</p>
<p t="505970" d="4479">of our autonomic nervous system; although
now and then we're conscious of its outputs.</p>
<p t="510449" d="5220">It governs the operation of our organs and
all the things that are so complex that we</p>
<p t="515669" d="3291">aren't allowed to mess with them as conscious
beings.</p>
<p t="518960" d="4730">But it's not conscious, and then somehow
some neurons are conscious.</p>
<p t="523690" d="3270">I tell you, we don't know anything about
consciousness.</p>
<p t="526960" d="2030">We really don't, we don't have a clue.</p>
<p t="528990" d="5230">I think it's probably because we're formulating
the question wrong.</p>
<p t="534220" d="5240">There are people who are materialist reductionists,
and they believe that consciousness is an</p>
<p t="539460" d="4010">emergent property of the underlying neuronal
function.</p>
<p t="543470" d="4840">The problem with that philosophy is that it's
predicated on the assumption that they understand</p>
<p t="548310" d="3760">what the matter is that's making up that
neuronal substrate.</p>
<p t="552070" d="4650">I can tell you that by the time we're able
to reduce consciousness to its underlying</p>
<p t="556720" d="4030">material structure, we'll think of whatever
matter is, in a way that's completely different</p>
<p t="560750" d="1390">than the way we think of it now.</p>
<p t="562140" d="4540">So there might be an eventual reduction, but
at the same time there's going to be a transformation</p>
<p t="566680" d="1300">of the theories.</p>
<p t="567980" d="6021">It's clear that we don't understand material
that well, particularly because when you go</p>
<p t="574001" d="6109">down to the tiny underlying substructures
at the subatomic level it behaves in a very,</p>
<p t="580110" d="2980">very peculiar manner.</p>
<p t="583090" d="3520">So anyways, all bets are off in regards to
consciousness.</p>
<p t="586610" d="6280">It also does seem to be something that's
likely very ancient.</p>
<p t="592890" d="2940">There are people who have attributed consciousness
to insects.</p>
<p t="595830" d="4530">Insects, by the way, seem to go out of their
way to take hallucinogenic drugs, which is</p>
<p t="600360" d="1020">quite interesting.</p>
<p t="601380" d="6190">So the fly agaric, for example, is the famous
red and white mushroom that you always see</p>
<p t="607570" d="3140">in fairy tales and in super Mario brothers.</p>
<p t="610710" d="1830">It pops up everywhere.</p>
<p t="612540" d="4600">Flies will come and take a bite of it and
they fall unconscious beside the mushroom</p>
<p t="617140" d="5330">and they stay there for ten or fifteen minutes,
and then they get up, but they go eat it again.</p>
<p t="622470" d="5060">Reindeer really like them too and they get
blitzed out of their mind on amanita muscaria.</p>
<p t="627530" d="6690">There's evidence for the desire to transform
states of consciousness, way, way down in</p>
<p t="634220" d="2500">the animal kingdom, way farther than you'd
think.</p>
<p t="636720" d="3280">So God only knows.</p>
<p t="640000" d="7200">Then you think well a big brain is necessary,
but if you consider something like Irene Pepperberg's</p>
<p t="647200" d="4210">African Grey parrot, which died a couple of
years ago – a famous animal which could</p>
<p t="651410" d="2810">speak better than a three year old kid.</p>
<p t="654220" d="4880">It had a good vocabulary, more than five hundred
words, and it could put together meaningful</p>
<p t="659100" d="1000">phrases.</p>
<p t="660100" d="2410">It could speak better than a chimpanzee.</p>
<p t="662510" d="2190">They use sign language of course.</p>
<p t="664700" d="1300">This was one smart bird.</p>
<p t="666000" d="3900">If you think about a bird, it has no brain,
a bird.</p>
<p t="669900" d="1600">It's got a brain about this big.</p>
<p t="671500" d="4150">I know a bird isn't very big, and that actually
makes a difference.</p>
<p t="675650" d="4970">The fact that that much intelligence could
be compacted in that small of an area, means</p>
<p t="680620" d="3550">as far as I'm concerned, that we don't
really understand very much about how the</p>
<p t="684170" d="2590">brain works.</p>
<p t="686760" d="3710">We do understand some things, and most of
the things we understand have actually been</p>
<p t="690470" d="3400">discovered by animal experimentalists.</p>
<p t="693870" d="1600">Which is a useful thing to know.</p>
<p t="695470" d="3440">Because of course there are a lot of people
who think that animal experimentation isn't</p>
<p t="698910" d="5810">a good idea, or that we could substitute computer
models – which is a spectacularly idiotic</p>
<p t="704720" d="1000">theory.</p>
<p t="705720" d="3950">Obviously if we had accurate computer models
we wouldn't need to do the animal experimentation.</p>
<p t="709670" d="5120">We're not going to build a computer model
that's better than our current understanding,</p>
<p t="714790" d="3750">at least not yet; we may in the future.</p>
<p t="718540" d="11250">Anyways you can think of the basic structures
that are producing these little sub-personalities</p>
<p t="729790" d="2420">as the output of fundamental biological systems.</p>
<p t="732210" d="1700">They're either motivations or emotions.</p>
<p t="733910" d="5570">The structure that appears to be most responsible
for this sort of thing, at least initially,</p>
<p t="739480" d="1000">is the hypothalamus.</p>
<p t="740480" d="2780">I should show you a little bit about the hypothalamus.</p>
<p t="743260" d="4750">Just so you kind of have a sense of what it
is.</p>
<p t="748010" d="6170">It's not very big, and you'll see in this
diagram that it sits right on top of the spinal</p>
<p t="754180" d="1990">cord and the base part of the brain.</p>
<p t="756170" d="2520">That's just that little bitty area there.</p>
<p t="758690" d="5960">It looks from the diagram it seems to be about
one percent of the entire brain mass or something</p>
<p t="764650" d="1000">like that.</p>
<p t="765650" d="3410">I think I mentioned to you before that if
you take a cat and you take all of its brain</p>
<p t="769060" d="4430">off, except for the hypothalamus, roughly
speaking, as long as it's a female cat in</p>
<p t="773490" d="6220">a restrictive environment, it can pretty much
live a cat life; except that it's hyper-exploratory.</p>
<p t="779710" d="3590">Which I do think is quite remarkable, because
you'd think that it would just lay there</p>
<p t="783300" d="4800">passively, since it doesn't have a brain.</p>
<p t="788100" d="5560">The hypothalamus, I'll show you some more
pictures here of the hypothalamus, this is</p>
<p t="793660" d="5160">a rat hypothalamus, and this is a diagram
from Larry Swanson, who's a real genius,</p>
<p t="798820" d="3140">and well-worth reading, although very complicated.</p>
<p t="801960" d="5490">He's a developmental neuro-anatomist, if
I remember correctly, and he's interested</p>
<p t="807450" d="4490">in how the brain unfolds across the course
of fetal development in all sorts of different</p>
<p t="811940" d="1100">animals.</p>
<p t="813040" d="4610">Assuming by doing that in part, you can track
the evolution, but you can also understand</p>
<p t="817650" d="2780">the relationship between one brain part and
another.</p>
<p t="820430" d="7880">What you see here, you see all of these little
sub-units of the hypothalamus, they're indicated</p>
<p t="828310" d="6630">in orange, green and black, and so the first
thing that you can see is the hypothalamus</p>
<p t="834940" d="7110">is not one thing, it's a bunch of ganglia,
I think is the correct name for the hypothalamic</p>
<p t="842050" d="1000">sub-organs.</p>
<p t="843050" d="7260">So, it's called a hypothalamus sort of for
convenience sake, you can identify it anatomically</p>
<p t="850310" d="7610">and it might be a good short-hand for a rough
description of the macrostructure of the brain,</p>
<p t="857920" d="4130">but of course the problem with the brain is,
you know, it's pattern one at this level</p>
<p t="862050" d="3320">and it's pattern two at this level, and
it's pattern three at this level.</p>
<p t="865370" d="3550">You can go a long ways down before you run
out of complexity.</p>
<p t="868920" d="5010">A cell is an unbelievably complicated thing,
and you have, God only knows how many of those</p>
<p t="873930" d="1300">things you have in your brain.</p>
<p t="875230" d="4870">I don't remember exactly what the latest
estimates are, but it's in the hundreds</p>
<p t="880100" d="1000">of billions.</p>
<p t="881100" d="6760">Each of those cells is as complex as really
complex factory, and it's full of these</p>
<p t="887860" d="4530">little molecular machines and they're doing
things that are so complicated and amazing,</p>
<p t="892390" d="4850">you just can't believe it when you – I've
seen computer animations of some of these</p>
<p t="897240" d="7190">structures in operation, and the complexity
of what they do to take the DNA molecule apart,</p>
<p t="904430" d="5160">and then to rebuild it little bit by little
bit, and to do error correction at the same</p>
<p t="909590" d="4380">time, it just boggles the mind.</p>
<p t="913970" d="5550">I cannot see how you can possibly account
for that using a straight, sort of Newtonian</p>
<p t="919520" d="6040">deterministic model of clock ward behavior;
the stuff is so sophisticated.</p>
<p t="925560" d="6590">It looks more like advanced robotics than
it does the interaction of tiny little molecules.</p>
<p t="932150" d="4840">There are molecules that work with the DNA
that can walk, and as they walk they carry</p>
<p t="936990" d="4930">other molecules, and not only can they walk,
they can walk over obstacles.</p>
<p t="941920" d="4070">They're like made out of ten molecules!</p>
<p t="945990" d="1510">What's going on?</p>
<p t="947500" d="2060">It's just beyond belief.</p>
<p t="949560" d="7710">Okay, so all of these little nuclei in the
hypothalamus, they're all doing slightly</p>
<p t="957270" d="5460">different things, they're radically different
things, although they have commonality in</p>
<p t="962730" d="1000">function.</p>
<p t="963730" d="4680">So, roughly what you could say is that one
half of the hypothalamus is devoted to popping</p>
<p t="968410" d="11119">up little sub-personalities that are devoted
to the satisfaction of fundamental biological</p>
<p t="979529" d="1560">requirements.</p>
<p t="981089" d="7561">It's not obvious what a fundamental biological
requirement is, because that's a heuristic,</p>
<p t="988650" d="7150">it's not a category, it's a fuzzy category,
but we can agree on some of its contents.</p>
<p t="995800" d="4130">So of course thirst, hunger and the need to
breathe would be in there, and might also</p>
<p t="999930" d="6730">add pain, and sexual desire and the need for
play, although that's a separate circuit</p>
<p t="1006660" d="5040">and it's not mediated by hypothalamic structures,
there's a different circuit for play.</p>
<p t="1011700" d="4450">Play slash affiliation.</p>
<p t="1016150" d="8710">Roughly speaking what an animal basically
chases and requires on a day-today and week-to-week</p>
<p t="1024860" d="3120">basis is mediated in large part by the hypothalamus.</p>
<p t="1027980" d="6760">And the hypothalamus is also a crucial nexus
in the brain for identifying what's going</p>
<p t="1034740" d="3569">on in the body and then telling the brain
what to do about it.</p>
<p t="1038309" d="3580">So for example the hypothalamus is the thing
that makes you hungry and the thing that makes</p>
<p t="1041889" d="1000">you thirsty.</p>
<p t="1042889" d="6461">It does that because it monitors levels of
substances such as sugar in your bloodstream,</p>
<p t="1049350" d="5959">and also the degree to which you're hydrated.</p>
<p t="1055309" d="5641">You can sustain tiny little bits of damage
to the hypothalamus, which has unbelievably</p>
<p t="1060950" d="1390">extreme consequences.</p>
<p t="1062340" d="8280">So for example, if you get unlucky, you can
develop hyper aphasia or, uncontrollable thirst.</p>
<p t="1070620" d="6090">If that part of your hypothalamus is damaged,
people just can't keep you away from water</p>
<p t="1076710" d="4579">supplies, you'll just drink and drink and
drink and drink until you drown.</p>
<p t="1081289" d="1510">You can't control it.</p>
<p t="1082799" d="3970">So the hypothalamus is no joke and hyperphagia
is the same thing, except in relationship</p>
<p t="1086769" d="1650">to food.</p>
<p t="1088419" d="7661">There have been reports of people who developed-
I knew a guy in Montreal, who used to work</p>
<p t="1096080" d="1000">at Harvard.</p>
<p t="1097080" d="1500">His name was Frank Irvin.</p>
<p t="1098580" d="6380">He did some of the earliest studies in the
world on the physiology of violent crime.</p>
<p t="1104960" d="7500">Frank had identified the role of epilepsy
as a progenator to violent crimes.</p>
<p t="1112460" d="5170">The defense rage circuit is part of the hypothalamus
and if you're unlucky you can have a particular</p>
<p t="1117630" d="4179">form of epilepsy that will activate the defense
rage system.</p>
<p t="1121809" d="4860">I knew someone who had a seizure condition
like that.</p>
<p t="1126669" d="3321">Then they get uncontrollably aggressive.</p>
<p t="1129990" d="3600">Now this guy has quite an interesting story.</p>
<p t="1133590" d="3610">So it first happened to him when he was about
eighteen.</p>
<p t="1137200" d="1740">He was out drinking in a bar.</p>
<p t="1138940" d="3270">Now, alcohol lowers your seizure threshold.</p>
<p t="1142210" d="7770">So he's out drinking in a bar and all of
a sudden he got up and tore his shirt off.</p>
<p t="1149980" d="3380">He was in an aggressive stance and backed
into the corner, and his friends were coming</p>
<p t="1153360" d="1110">towards him.</p>
<p t="1154470" d="3429">He told them to go away or I'll hit you.</p>
<p t="1157899" d="5120">Now he was a very well socialized person,
so I think what happened is he went into this</p>
<p t="1163019" d="5321">defensive rage state, but because he was so
well socialized, he could tell people to stay</p>
<p t="1168340" d="3809">away from him, but he couldn't stop himself
from hitting them and attacking them if they</p>
<p t="1172149" d="1650">got close enough.</p>
<p t="1173799" d="5100">So anyways, I believe at that point he slapped
a police officer who came to rescue him.</p>
<p t="1178899" d="5321">They took him to the hospital and on the way
there he hit his fingers against the hood</p>
<p t="1184220" d="5120">of the car and put dents in it, and then when
he got to the hospital – now I don't remember</p>
<p t="1189340" d="4529">the particulars of this – but he picked
up a kidney bowl, which is like an enamel</p>
<p t="1193869" d="3841">covered steel bowl, and twisted it in a figure
eight.</p>
<p t="1197710" d="3189">It's like, try that, it's not so easy.</p>
<p t="1200899" d="6640">The next time it happened he was in another
bar, so what the hypothesis was then, was</p>
<p t="1207539" d="6260">that someone had spiked his alcohol with some
sort of drug, but that was never demonstrated.</p>
<p t="1213799" d="5161">He got off of all that because he had no record,
he was a perfectly peaceful person.</p>
<p t="1218960" d="3480">Then the next time it happened he was in another
bar, and he did the same thing.</p>
<p t="1222440" d="3219">He backed into the corner and he ripped off
his shirt, and he told me that when he was</p>
<p t="1225659" d="3970">looking, he looked down the hallway and all
he could see was fire.</p>
<p t="1229629" d="6384">A policewoman came to get him, because the
bar called the police, and he hit her.</p>
<p t="1236013" d="5156">Then after that he had EEG testing, which
showed that he was susceptible to seizures</p>
<p t="1241169" d="1271">so he swore off alcohol.</p>
<p t="1242440" d="2369">He never had another drink and he's like
thirty-five now.</p>
<p t="1244809" d="2761">He never had another drink in his life and
it never happened again.</p>
<p t="1247570" d="5520">It's just a good example of – there was
a kid at the University of Texas, at Austin,</p>
<p t="1253090" d="5050">about thirty years ago, who seemed to have
a perfectly reasonable family life and so</p>
<p t="1258140" d="4310">far, a reasonable upbringing, and he started
to become increasingly violent in his fantasies.</p>
<p t="1262450" d="4979">He climbed up onto the tower, because there's
a high tower at the University of Texas at</p>
<p t="1267429" d="3610">Austin, and he took at high-powered rifle
and I think he shot sixteen people before</p>
<p t="1271039" d="1990">they finally got him.</p>
<p t="1273029" d="3381">When they did an autopsy, they found he had
a high-pressing tumor that was growing on</p>
<p t="1276410" d="1610">the hypothalamus.</p>
<p t="1278020" d="2609">The hypothalamus is no joke.</p>
<p t="1280629" d="5130">For those of you who's introduction to neuropsychology
has made you assume that the cortex is in</p>
<p t="1285759" d="7520">control, let me tell you, the cortex is only
in control when all of your other basic requirements</p>
<p t="1293279" d="1831">are satiated.</p>
<p t="1295110" d="4880">Since you're a modern person, and you live
in luxury, that's unparalleled in the history</p>
<p t="1299990" d="7460">of the world, all of your fundamental biological
sub-personalities are always satiated.</p>
<p t="1307450" d="3050">That's what you think you're like.</p>
<p t="1310500" d="5249">You're only like that because you've never
been anywhere where you weren't like that.</p>
<p t="1315749" d="6251">So anyways, here's one of the things that's
cool about the hypothalamus.</p>
<p t="1322000" d="3879">The first thing is that you have these different
sub-systems, these different nuclei that are</p>
<p t="1325879" d="2660">responsible for these different sub-personalities.</p>
<p t="1328539" d="4850">Oriented towards sexuality, oriented towards
hunger, oriented towards thirst, oriented</p>
<p t="1333389" d="3270">towards temperature regulation, etc.</p>
<p t="1336659" d="4921">I think of them as sub-personalities because
they have a viewpoint, they want something</p>
<p t="1341580" d="4150">and they want to go somewhere, they want to
accomplish it efficiently, and they have emotions</p>
<p t="1345730" d="4639">that go along with it so, you know, if you're
going for some water and you drop your glass,</p>
<p t="1350369" d="3581">or somebody gets in your way, or the tap isn't
working, you're going to feel frustration,</p>
<p t="1353950" d="1550">anxiety and irritation.</p>
<p t="1355500" d="6559">They come fulyl equipped with emotions, they
have their own motor outputs, so they basically</p>
<p t="1362059" d="6720">prime, and those would be the motor outputs
that are aggregations of habits that you have</p>
<p t="1368779" d="5911">been able to learn that have aided you previously
in your water-searching behavior.</p>
<p t="1374690" d="4040">So for us, that would be getting a glass out
of the cupboard, which is a gripping issue,</p>
<p t="1378730" d="3789">and a transport issue, and then you have to
turn on the tap.</p>
<p t="1382519" d="6400">Luria, who's a famous Russian psychologist
called those things Kinetic Melodies.</p>
<p t="1388919" d="4711">If you think about it from a Piagetian perspective
and a Lurian perspective at the same time,</p>
<p t="1393630" d="6860">you think how Piaget talked about how children
put together basic – they're not reflexes</p>
<p t="1400490" d="3929">exactly, they're complex sequences of what
started as reflexes.</p>
<p t="1404419" d="6010">Then those can be linked together in a sort
of dance that you're always doing with your</p>
<p t="1410429" d="1000">body.</p>
<p t="1411429" d="5521">Each of those little dances, you think water-seeking,
you're going to have a set of water relevant</p>
<p t="1416950" d="4809">dances that you can do that your experiences
taught you to become an expert at.</p>
<p t="1421759" d="2631">When you get thirsty those are likely disinhibited.</p>
<p t="1424390" d="5909">That's my guess, they're disinhibited
and prepared for execution.</p>
<p t="1430299" d="5021">Then the specifics of the circumstance that
you're in will determine which ones are</p>
<p t="1435320" d="1209">disinhibited enough to actually run.</p>
<p t="1436529" d="3130">It's like you're full of little machines
and they're all on.</p>
<p t="1439659" d="6911">They're ready to go, but they're all held
in stasis in some sense by some cortical inhibition.</p>
<p t="1446570" d="2739">I like to think of the brain sort of like
a nuclear reactor.</p>
<p t="1449309" d="4550">The core is really active, it's on, but
then you have all of these rods going into</p>
<p t="1453859" d="4111">the core to keep it from going critical.</p>
<p t="1457970" d="3949">The cortex is sort of like that in relationship
to the lower parts of the brain.</p>
<p t="1461919" d="2671">Those parts of the brain, man, they're alive.</p>
<p t="1464590" d="2380">They're like the Titans of mythology.</p>
<p t="1466970" d="4559">They're sitting down there, these fundamental
forces and they're ready to leap into action</p>
<p t="1471529" d="1500">at a moment's notice.</p>
<p t="1473029" d="6471">But the cortex basically keeps them inhibited,
and it seems to do that – so imagine that</p>
<p t="1479500" d="3409">you have a vision of your desired future.</p>
<p t="1482909" d="6421">Then a vision of the transformation stages
that you're going to undertake to move from</p>
<p t="1489330" d="2829">where you are to that desired future.</p>
<p t="1492159" d="5640">Then what you're doing is you're comparing
your interpretation of the present to your</p>
<p t="1497799" d="3071">interpretation of the desired future.</p>
<p t="1500870" d="6320">As long as those two things match, which the
hippocampus is the thing that's determining</p>
<p t="1507190" d="4709">that, it's the thing that's computing
the match between your fantasy of what you</p>
<p t="1511899" d="3520">want to happen with your fantasy about what
is happening.</p>
<p t="1515419" d="6531">As long as that matches then the hippocampus
basically, now we don't know exactly how</p>
<p t="1521950" d="3670">this works, although it seems to work to some
degree through modulation of the reticular</p>
<p t="1525620" d="6789">activating system – if the hippocampus matches
what you want with what's happening, then</p>
<p t="1532409" d="3221">all these other little sub-systems basically
turn off.</p>
<p t="1535630" d="5419">If the hippocampus detects a mismatch, which
is when novelty occurs – something went</p>
<p t="1541049" d="4071">wrong, then you get disinhibition of the reticular
activating system.</p>
<p t="1545120" d="4019">It's like you wake up, and then everything
is primed for action.</p>
<p t="1549139" d="3801">That solves the problem of what you should
do when you don't know what to do.</p>
<p t="1552940" d="3579">The answer is, you should get ready to do
everything.</p>
<p t="1556519" d="6620">You should be on alert and ready to implement
whatever actions – it's not even whatever</p>
<p t="1563139" d="6900">actions, it's more like you should be ready
to implement whatever sub-personalities the</p>
<p t="1570039" d="4811">situation seems to call for, as soon as you're
able to identify what they are.</p>
<p t="1574850" d="2590">Otherwise it's sort of like an army that's
on alert.</p>
<p t="1577440" d="3049">You don't know who's going to be called
on, but everybody should be ready.</p>
<p t="1580489" d="3540">That's a high stress situation.</p>
<p t="1584029" d="5081">Okay, so part of the hypothalamus, let's
say for the sake of argument, it's popping</p>
<p t="1589110" d="4100">up all of these little sub-personalities that
have to do with basic instincts.</p>
<p t="1593210" d="7120">The words are all wrong because they're
not – an instinct sounds like a drive and</p>
<p t="1600330" d="1510">people aren't driven.</p>
<p t="1601840" d="3409">We're not that simple, we're much more
flexible than that.</p>
<p t="1605249" d="1400">Even rats aren't driven.</p>
<p t="1606649" d="6191">There's a very seminal experiment that was
done at the height of behaviorism.</p>
<p t="1612840" d="5279">So the idea with behaviorists, perfectly smart
idea, was that the way a rat learned was,</p>
<p t="1618119" d="5260">it would start with a reflex, sort of in the
Piagetian sense, and then you could teach</p>
<p t="1623379" d="4880">it a new routine which was an aggregation
of little, tiny reflexes, you could teach</p>
<p t="1628259" d="2100">it a new routine by rewarding it.</p>
<p t="1630359" d="3871">So let's say, here's what you do with
a rat: so you want to teach the rat to climb</p>
<p t="1634230" d="2519">the ladder and go across it.</p>
<p t="1636749" d="6660">So the rat's sniffing around in the little
rat cage.</p>
<p t="1643409" d="3601">Then it gets close to the ladder, so you give
it a food pellet.</p>
<p t="1647010" d="2539">Then it hangs around close to the ladder.</p>
<p t="1649549" d="6531">It's because you've reinforced the manifestation
of those micro-behaviors that are associated</p>
<p t="1656080" d="1000">with the ladder.</p>
<p t="1657080" d="4349">Then maybe at some point the rat puts a little
paw up on the first rung, so you give it a</p>
<p t="1661429" d="1000">food pellet.</p>
<p t="1662429" d="1821">Then the rat is going like this very frequently.</p>
<p t="1664250" d="4200">Then the next thing that happens is it puts
two paws up there, and you know if you're</p>
<p t="1668450" d="5540">patient, using reward you can get that damn
rat to do damn near anything.</p>
<p t="1673990" d="6069">Skinner taught pigeons to navigate guided
missiles by maps in the Second World War,</p>
<p t="1680059" d="1000">by pecking.</p>
<p t="1681059" d="2740">They never did use them, but really that's
pretty impressive.</p>
<p t="1683799" d="4070">You think pigeons are stupid, they're not
stupid they can read maps, which is pretty</p>
<p t="1687869" d="2550">damn amazing.</p>
<p t="1690419" d="5411">So the idea was is what the animal is doing
is chaining together deterministic reflexes.</p>
<p t="1695830" d="5390">The thing about a deterministic reflex is
that it's not flexible right?</p>
<p t="1701220" d="3659">If it's a deterministic reflex, it really
is a drive.</p>
<p t="1704879" d="5591">Action A initiates Action B, which initiates
Action C and it's a fixed action pattern.</p>
<p t="1710470" d="2169">Some animals do seem to learn that way.</p>
<p t="1712639" d="1410">There are these little animals.</p>
<p t="1714049" d="3771">I think they're moles that do this, it's
shrews.</p>
<p t="1717820" d="10370">Let's say you teach a shrew to go from point
A to B by a very inefficient maze-like route.</p>
<p t="1728190" d="6030">But the shrew could just walk straight there,
but once he learns to do this, but he can't</p>
<p t="1734220" d="2089">figure out that he's going from here to
here.</p>
<p t="1736309" d="6011">Whereas if you train a rat to do this the
rat will figure out, to hell with all of this</p>
<p t="1742320" d="7520">circuitousness, it's just going to go straight
from point a to point b. that finding was</p>
<p t="1749840" d="9100">part of what indicated to early neuro-psychological
researchers that animals produced a map of</p>
<p t="1758940" d="1180">the environment.</p>
<p t="1760120" d="4499">In some sense what we're talking about when
we're talking about these structures, the</p>
<p t="1764619" d="2091">A to B structure, is a map.</p>
<p t="1766710" d="3550">That's another way you can look at it.</p>
<p t="1770260" d="2859">So you've got this rat and it's behaviors
are all chained together.</p>
<p t="1773119" d="4341">So I already told you, I spoiled the story
in some sense, because I told you that the</p>
<p t="1777460" d="2380">rat could learn to take a short cut.</p>
<p t="1779840" d="5769">One of the earlier demonstrations of the independence
of rat learning from the reflex of conditioning</p>
<p t="1785609" d="3200">was that - so let's say you've trained
a rat to run down a maze.</p>
<p t="1788809" d="4490">Okay so hypothetically it's using it's
front legs and it's back legs and it's</p>
<p t="1793299" d="1810">learned to chain all of that together.</p>
<p t="1795109" d="2160">“Front leg, back leg, movement, turn left.</p>
<p t="1797269" d="2480">Front let, back leg, movement, turn right.</p>
<p t="1799749" d="4401">Etc.” so then, what if you put the rat,
you tie up it's back legs and you put him</p>
<p t="1804150" d="4200">in a little rat wheel barrel, so it's got
wheels instead of legs – it's like the</p>
<p t="1808350" d="1919">rat zooms through the maze.</p>
<p t="1810269" d="6760">So much for the reflex theory because obviously
you didn't train the rat to use a cart with</p>
<p t="1817029" d="4581">it's rear-end stuck in it, it figured that
out all by itself.</p>
<p t="1821610" d="5040">So anyways there is a system in you that allows
you to chain reflexes together.</p>
<p t="1826650" d="3909">It's a very primordial reflex system and
the behaviorists got that right.</p>
<p t="1830559" d="4490">It's fast, very very fast, because it requires
few neural connections.</p>
<p t="1835049" d="7250">So there are some advantages to simple learning
but once you get up to even the moderately</p>
<p t="1842299" d="7321">higher cortical and sub-cortical functions,
you're past the point of mere reflex chaining.</p>
<p t="1849620" d="6210">Okay so, let's for the sake of simplicity
the hypothalamus says, you need water.</p>
<p t="1855830" d="2800">So you're current state is that you're
thirsty and you're desired state is you</p>
<p t="1858630" d="1249">get to go to the tap.</p>
<p t="1859879" d="5240">You can feel your mouth dry and so forth,
and some fantasies of drinking water start</p>
<p t="1865119" d="4081">to come to your mind, and then all of sudden
you're kind of possessed by that.</p>
<p t="1869200" d="5909">So it's starting to interfere with your
conscious goal-directed behavior at that point,</p>
<p t="1875109" d="5231">and finally it's insistent enough like something
knocking at the door so you think, man I'm</p>
<p t="1880340" d="1000">thirsty.</p>
<p t="1881340" d="4600">Maybe you enough think that you'll work
better if you have something to drink.</p>
<p t="1885940" d="4880">So you go off to the fountain, and what your
hippocampus is doing – you've got this</p>
<p t="1890820" d="4010">little idea, which is your desired future
which is about how this trip is supposed to</p>
<p t="1894830" d="6390">go, and then you're watching to see how
the trip is actually going, but that's an</p>
<p t="1901220" d="2220">interpretation too.</p>
<p t="1903440" d="3949">If there's a match between the two then
the hippocampus just leaves you the hell alone</p>
<p t="1907389" d="3691">and you don't get anxious, you don't get
knocked off the track.</p>
<p t="1911080" d="5620">You go there, you have the water, that satiates
that system, that's a form of reward it's</p>
<p t="1916700" d="3829">called consumeratory reward, and then that
systems disappears.</p>
<p t="1920529" d="5000">It goes back to the dungeons from which it
emerged and in all likelihood another one</p>
<p t="1925529" d="1000">pops up.</p>
<p t="1926529" d="6110">Now, it's an oversimplification of human
behavior to assume that you just go from one</p>
<p t="1932639" d="5010">hypothalamically mediated state to another,
although I would say that's what two-year</p>
<p t="1937649" d="1600">olds do.</p>
<p t="1939249" d="2091">In some sense, that's what animals do.</p>
<p t="1941340" d="4669">The two-year old's doing it because that
little creature hasn't gotten any more organized</p>
<p t="1946009" d="2400">than hypothalamic.</p>
<p t="1948409" d="1721">You can see this if you watch two year olds.</p>
<p t="1950130" d="1210">It's like they're laughing and then they're
crying.</p>
<p t="1951340" d="3409">Then they're hungry and then they're hot
and then they need to go to the bathroom and</p>
<p t="1954749" d="1331">then they want to play.</p>
<p t="1956080" d="4630">It's just one, pure, motivated or emotional
state after another.</p>
<p t="1960710" d="1309">It's quite fun to watch.</p>
<p t="1962019" d="4551">They're also relatively hyper-exploratory
and playful.</p>
<p t="1966570" d="5329">They're cycling through those things all
of the time.</p>
<p t="1971899" d="3090">So you can't say that that's really what
an adult human does.</p>
<p t="1974989" d="8351">The reason for that is that the problem with
the pure – the reason you need a cortex</p>
<p t="1983340" d="4850">and other sub-cortical structures that aren't
hypothalamic is because the world is too complex</p>
<p t="1988190" d="6359">for those primordial systems to solve the
problems they're supposed to solve A, in</p>
<p t="1994549" d="6940">every possible situation, and B, across multiple
time frames, and C, in an environment that</p>
<p t="2001489" d="4530">consists of the interactions between other
very complex beings.</p>
<p t="2006019" d="8890">So it's almost like an arm's race of complexity
in some sense that's driven our evolution</p>
<p t="2014909" d="5190">– the smarter you get in some sense the
more variable you get.</p>
<p t="2020099" d="5030">That's a problem because as I got smarter,
say over the course of evolution, well you</p>
<p t="2025129" d="1520">people got smarter too.</p>
<p t="2026649" d="4931">We're all competing and cooperating with
each other, so the whole damn system is getting</p>
<p t="2031580" d="2360">more and more complex.</p>
<p t="2033940" d="5339">You have to grow a brain in order to manage
that at least, or you keep it simple – well,</p>
<p t="2039279" d="1541">we didn't keep it simple.</p>
<p t="2040820" d="2079">So we decided to grow a brain instead.</p>
<p t="2042899" d="5971">I don't know if you know this but you've
looked at a chimpanzee – they don't look</p>
<p t="2048870" d="1650">a lot like human beings.</p>
<p t="2050520" d="5119">There are obviously some things in common,
their hands are quite human and their ears</p>
<p t="2055639" d="5461">are quite human, but their forehead comes
down to about here, and they're kind of</p>
<p t="2061100" d="1440">shaped like this.</p>
<p t="2062540" d="7270">They've got a huge, round body, and whereas
a human being is sort of like a stick with</p>
<p t="2069810" d="4120">two sticks coming out of it, and two more
sticks – we're really, really thin, hardly</p>
<p t="2073930" d="1700">any gut.</p>
<p t="2075630" d="5490">Whereas a chimpanzee, it's intestinal structures
are way, way, way longer than ours.</p>
<p t="2081120" d="2180">So it has to pack that into this huge gut.</p>
<p t="2083300" d="4500">A damn chimpanzee sits around for eight hours
a day chewing.</p>
<p t="2087800" d="3480">The reason for that is it eats leaves.</p>
<p t="2091280" d="2350">You go out into the forest and see how many
damn leaves you have to eat before you feel</p>
<p t="2093630" d="1350">full.</p>
<p t="2094980" d="2982">All the chimp does is sit there and chew leaves.</p>
<p t="2097962" d="3898">Then it has this huge gut so it can extract
some nourishment out of it.</p>
<p t="2101860" d="4750">We figured out how to solve that problem once
we discovered fire and hunting, because we</p>
<p t="2106610" d="2530">could cook things.</p>
<p t="2109140" d="5100">That enabled us, at least in principle, to
trade gut for brain, which I think was a pretty</p>
<p t="2114240" d="6100">useful trade, all things considered, although
it still might get us into trouble.</p>
<p t="2120340" d="3030">The brain's a very energy-hungry organ.</p>
<p t="2123370" d="4650">We eat very, very efficient food and it turns
out that cooked food is much more nutritious</p>
<p t="2128020" d="4640">from a caloric perspective than raw food.</p>
<p t="2132660" d="4420">You can afford to sit around and develop a
brain if you've got high-quality food.</p>
<p t="2137080" d="5270">Otherwise you're out there in the jungle
chewing on leaves like an idiot, it's just</p>
<p t="2142350" d="1240">about as bad as pandas.</p>
<p t="2143590" d="2710">Do you know why those things are damn near
extinct?</p>
<p t="2146300" d="3510">They used to be carnivores but all they eat
is bamboo shoots now.</p>
<p t="2149810" d="2700">That's it, nothing else, bamboo shoots.</p>
<p t="2152510" d="5270">They have no nutrition so they have to eat
bamboo shoots all day.</p>
<p t="2157780" d="3260">Now and then the bamboo crop fails and there
aren't any shoots.</p>
<p t="2161040" d="1650">It's like, so much for the pandas.</p>
<p t="2162690" d="5520">If an animal ever deserved to go extinct it
was definitely the panda.</p>
<p t="2168210" d="4830">Hunt something, the lazy bastards!</p>
<p t="2173040" d="6140">Anyways, now I discovered this about the hypothalamus
when I was ready Larry Swanson, it just bloody-well</p>
<p t="2179180" d="4470">blew me away, you'll see why, at least in
part.</p>
<p t="2183650" d="5150">Half of the hypothalamus, roughly speaking,
is sort of devoted to popping up these basic,</p>
<p t="2188800" d="4440">primal sub-personalities; the sorts of things
that you share with animals.</p>
<p t="2193240" d="3350">Then you might say, what happens when one
of those doesn't work?</p>
<p t="2196590" d="3110">The answer is, well you get an anxiety response.</p>
<p t="2199700" d="5320">Now, the anxiety response is not mediated
by the hypothalamus, and neither is pain.</p>
<p t="2205020" d="6090">So, if you're an idiot your body hurts you
or tells you or scares you.</p>
<p t="2211110" d="6060">What's interesting about that is the pain
systems and the anxiety systems are not in</p>
<p t="2217170" d="2590">the hypothalamus, they're separate systems.</p>
<p t="2219760" d="2640">The pain system is old, old, old.</p>
<p t="2222400" d="3690">It may be as old as the hypothalamus, it's
way down there in your brain.</p>
<p t="2226090" d="4760">But, the anxiety system is a lot newer and
that kind of makes sense.</p>
<p t="2230850" d="4480">You can imagine the primordial organisms really
didn't stop until they ran into something</p>
<p t="2235330" d="1470">that was hurting them.”</p>
<p t="2236800" d="4870">They couldn't think, “oh no, I might run
into something that will hurt me.</p>
<p t="2241670" d="3820">You can't think that roughly until you have
an amygdala.</p>
<p t="2245490" d="5430">The amygdala is responsible for lots of things,
and all of these areas are interconnected.</p>
<p t="2250920" d="4590">One of the things it seems to be responsible
for, at least impart, is anxiety.</p>
<p t="2255510" d="6610">When your hippocampus detects a mismatch between
what you want to have happen and what is happening,</p>
<p t="2262120" d="3780">it disinhibits the reticular activating system,
and one of the things it activates is the</p>
<p t="2265900" d="1000">anxiety system.</p>
<p t="2266900" d="4460">The anxiety system says, “stop, you idiot,
you don't know where you are or what you're</p>
<p t="2271360" d="2690">doing and so you should quit before you get
into trouble.”</p>
<p t="2274050" d="6360">We don't like that feeling very much, that
freezes us, but it's better than pain.</p>
<p t="2280410" d="3060">You feel anxiety so you don't have to feel
pain.</p>
<p t="2283470" d="9640">Pain seems to occur when you encounter a stimulus,
let's say a situation, where the stimulus</p>
<p t="2293110" d="5740">magnitude is sufficient to damage those parts
of you that are encountering it – so too</p>
<p t="2298850" d="6410">bright a light, too hot a flame, too cold
a piece of metal, too hot food, whatever.</p>
<p t="2305260" d="4940">If it's of sufficient magnitude to damage
you, you get a pain response out of that.</p>
<p t="2310200" d="4260">The pain response is supposed to teach the
part of you that moves forward, not to do</p>
<p t="2314460" d="1070">that again.</p>
<p t="2315530" d="4050">The anxiety system responds to cues of pain.</p>
<p t="2319580" d="3730">The pain system is pretty complicated as well.</p>
<p t="2323310" d="3290">Frustration is a pain-like stimulus.</p>
<p t="2326600" d="2460">Disappointment is a pain-like stimulus.</p>
<p t="2329060" d="2930">Grief and loneliness are pain-like stimuli.</p>
<p t="2331990" d="2530">Depression is probably a pain condition.</p>
<p t="2334520" d="5930">So even though the pain system is quite primordial,
it's grown up like a complex tree, and it</p>
<p t="2340450" d="3170">consumes many different functions.</p>
<p t="2343620" d="7200">It's still a very ancient system, whereas
the amygdalian system, which is newer, you've</p>
<p t="2350820" d="4510">developed over time to tell you what might
hurt you so that you can avoid contacting</p>
<p t="2355330" d="1000">it.</p>
<p t="2356330" d="4530">You've got your hypothalamus and it's
telling you – it's laying out these little</p>
<p t="2360860" d="4440">sub-personalities that are helping you deal
with the fundamental necessities of the word.</p>
<p t="2365300" d="5240">The pain system is there to tell you when
you have encountered a situation that's</p>
<p t="2370540" d="5100">harmful, the anxiety system is there to tell
you when you might going to encounter something</p>
<p t="2375640" d="1000">harmful.</p>
<p t="2376640" d="3130">That's the thing that's activated when
there's a mismatch.</p>
<p t="2379770" d="5320">The mismatch says you don't know where you
are or where you're going, and so you might</p>
<p t="2385090" d="1760">get hurt.</p>
<p t="2386850" d="5750">The other thing that happens, roughly speaking,
is that when the hippocampus disinhibits the</p>
<p t="2392600" d="6110">reticular activating system that turns the
other half of the hypothalamus on.</p>
<p t="2398710" d="5820">This is quite cool because the other half
of the hypothalamus is the place where the</p>
<p t="2404530" d="2770">ventral tegmental area is located.</p>
<p t="2407300" d="4800">The ventral tegmental area is the part of
the brain where the dopaminergic tracks emerge,</p>
<p t="2412100" d="7830">and those are the tracks that you use A, to
explore, and B, to respond to cues of consumatory</p>
<p t="2419930" d="1000">reward.</p>
<p t="2420930" d="5920">So what that means in non-technical language
is that when you encounter mismatch you get</p>
<p t="2426850" d="4590">anxious, which is what you should do, you
should stop, something's wrong.</p>
<p t="2431440" d="5150">As long as nothing else happens that's painful
or threatening, than that system starts to</p>
<p t="2436590" d="4760">acclimatize, partly because you're looking
around and thinking.</p>
<p t="2441350" d="2500">People often talk about this as habituation.</p>
<p t="2443850" d="2050">That's a stupid idea.</p>
<p t="2445900" d="2520">It's habituation if you're a sea slug.</p>
<p t="2448420" d="5280">It's not a habituation if you're a person,
except that in very, very primordial reflex-like</p>
<p t="2453700" d="1680">levels of the nervous system.</p>
<p t="2455380" d="3950">At the higher order levels that we're talking
about, it's learning.</p>
<p t="2459330" d="2780">If you stop and you're anxious, what happens?</p>
<p t="2462110" d="4130">Well, generally speaking, you start thinking,
what the hell might be going on?</p>
<p t="2466240" d="4910">You're running through all of these different
theories and part of the way that works is</p>
<p t="2471150" d="5570">that it's partly a consequence of state-dependent
learning.</p>
<p t="2476720" d="5980">If you're anxious you're going to be primed
to remember situations that you were anxious</p>
<p t="2482700" d="1550">in before.</p>
<p t="2484250" d="1300">Why should you do that?</p>
<p t="2485550" d="7640">The reason for that is that “things that
make you anxious” is a category.</p>
<p t="2493190" d="1930">It's actually a category.</p>
<p t="2495120" d="4670">We tend to think of categories as something
that exists in the objective world.</p>
<p t="2499790" d="2680">That is not how your brain categorizes things.</p>
<p t="2502470" d="5370">You have to learn that really painfully to
make objective categorizations.</p>
<p t="2507840" d="5010">As far as your natural nervous system is concerned
all things that go “bump” in the night</p>
<p t="2512850" d="2060">are the same thing.</p>
<p t="2514910" d="1000">What is that?</p>
<p t="2515910" d="6110">It's some bloody, horrible predatory, crocodilian,
dragon-like, monster that hides under your</p>
<p t="2522020" d="3030">bed and comes out and bites you when you're
three.</p>
<p t="2525050" d="5500">I just read a little paper today about this
kind of cat that lived back when were still</p>
<p t="2530550" d="2040">figuring out how to use spears.</p>
<p t="2532590" d="5570">This was a particularly nasty kind of cat,
and it preyed on us, roughly speaking.</p>
<p t="2538160" d="4900">We didn't get eaten by too many cats because
cats really can't bite through the skull.</p>
<p t="2543060" d="3310">They could go for your neck but they didn't
necessarily kill you.</p>
<p t="2546370" d="4600">This cat had a mouth that fit right around
your skull and it had two teeth that went</p>
<p t="2550970" d="2210">in here and two teeth that went in here.</p>
<p t="2553180" d="2250">It was a silent killer.</p>
<p t="2555430" d="5660">There is evidence that even children are capable
of recognizing the motion in pattern of a</p>
<p t="2561090" d="6310">predatory cat, and one of the hypotheses is
that we still have all of our primate ancestors</p>
<p t="2567400" d="2110">that didn't get eaten by that particular
cat.</p>
<p t="2569510" d="7920">We're pretty damn good at detecting cats,
at least of that type, and we seem to have</p>
<p t="2577430" d="3450">conserved that ability at least to some degree.</p>
<p t="2580880" d="6280">You think about a category, you might think
well there's fish and there's birds and</p>
<p t="2587160" d="5640">there's mammals and there's reptiles,
those are Linnaean classifications, they're</p>
<p t="2592800" d="3700">based in some sense on Evolutionary divergence.</p>
<p t="2596500" d="4670">Where they're not, on morphology.</p>
<p t="2601170" d="2260">Who cares about that?</p>
<p t="2603430" d="4380">Things that eat you, that's a category.</p>
<p t="2607810" d="1570">You need that category.</p>
<p t="2609380" d="3090">The other category is also things that might
eat you.</p>
<p t="2612470" d="4960">So things that eat you, those are things that
can hurt you and the things that might eat</p>
<p t="2617430" d="3240">you are things you haven't classified yet,
but might be dangerous.</p>
<p t="2620670" d="4450">That's your brain's natural category;
one of them.</p>
<p t="2625120" d="4200">Then you might think well if that's the
natural category, see that's the sort of</p>
<p t="2629320" d="12160">thing that the guy that wrote An Ecological
Approach on Vision Perception, he talked about</p>
<p t="2641480" d="2860">as an affordance.</p>
<p t="2644340" d="5540">An affordance is something who's meaning
you instantly perceive.</p>
<p t="2649880" d="4200">So you might say, “No, no, no, you see a
cat.”</p>
<p t="2654080" d="2650">Then you infer that it might eat you.</p>
<p t="2656730" d="4030">No, you see something that might eat you,
and then you might be able to figure out that</p>
<p t="2660760" d="1040">it's a cat.</p>
<p t="2661800" d="5970">It's the “might eat you” that you see
first, no the damn cat.</p>
<p t="2667770" d="8710">This is a fascinating phenomenon because it
suggests, like the Heidigerians proposed,</p>
<p t="2676480" d="5390">that what you perceive first in the world
is meanings and out of the meanings you extract</p>
<p t="2681870" d="1000">objects.</p>
<p t="2682870" d="2260">It's not the other way around.</p>
<p t="2685130" d="4390">If you look at the way your brain is organized,
that's how it works folks.</p>
<p t="2689520" d="7100">The more primordial your brain system is,
which means the more ancient it is, the more</p>
<p t="2696620" d="3380">its perception is action predicated.</p>
<p t="2700000" d="4810">So for example, if you hear a loud noise behind
you and you startle, that's your response.</p>
<p t="2704810" d="5840">So you're going into a crouch where it would
be difficult for a tiger to bite your neck.</p>
<p t="2710650" d="4680">You do that, man that's way before your
thinking.</p>
<p t="2715330" d="3560">It's before your perceiving, consciously.</p>
<p t="2718890" d="3210">You're not getting images or sounds at that
point.</p>
<p t="2722100" d="1610">It's so quick.</p>
<p t="2723710" d="3870">That's a category: things that make you
go like this.</p>
<p t="2727580" d="2130">That's a good category.</p>
<p t="2729710" d="3150">The reason I'm making such a case about
that category is because that's one of the</p>
<p t="2732860" d="5190">mythological categories: Things that go bump
in the night.</p>
<p t="2738050" d="4740">One of the things that primordial people were
trying to figure out is – you could think</p>
<p t="2742790" d="4590">of any old animal as figuring out how to escape
from a predator.</p>
<p t="2747380" d="2500">That isn't what human beings wanted to figure
out.</p>
<p t="2749880" d="2860">Not once we were able to abstract.</p>
<p t="2752740" d="4840">What we wanted to do instead was to figure
out how to escape from the class of all things</p>
<p t="2757580" d="4690">that could eat you; not just any particular
old thing, but all of them at once.</p>
<p t="2762270" d="2250">That's the advantage to categorization.</p>
<p t="2764520" d="3200">Can we arrange things so that nothing could
eat us?</p>
<p t="2767720" d="2040">How do you go about doing that?</p>
<p t="2769760" d="3780">Believe me, we've been working on that problem
for a very, very long time.</p>
<p t="2773540" d="3591">One of the answers we came up with, we'll
get into this later, is the idea of sacrifice.</p>
<p t="2777131" d="4159">Sacrifice is a very, very ancient idea.</p>
<p t="2781290" d="2290">I'll just give you a bit of a preview.</p>
<p t="2783580" d="5170">It took me like twenty years to figure this
out.</p>
<p t="2788750" d="2370">Human beings discovered sacrifice a long time
ago.</p>
<p t="2791120" d="2830">They acted it out before they understood it.</p>
<p t="2793950" d="2450">We act out lots of things before we understand
them.</p>
<p t="2796400" d="4050">The idea is sort of well we can make a bargain
with God.</p>
<p t="2800450" d="1620">You might say, well what's God?</p>
<p t="2802070" d="4210">We'll approach that problem later, it's
a very complicated problem.</p>
<p t="2806280" d="7431">One thing you could think of God as, is, God
is the anthropomorphic representation of the</p>
<p t="2813711" d="3489">entire social structure across time.</p>
<p t="2817200" d="3660">You might say, well God will reward you if
you behave properly.</p>
<p t="2820860" d="1520">What does that mean?</p>
<p t="2822380" d="6120">Imagine you could conceive of everyone that
wasn't you as one metaperson.</p>
<p t="2828500" d="2560">Imagine that that metaperson is God.</p>
<p t="2831060" d="1400">You can make a deal with that thing.</p>
<p t="2832460" d="7360">You can say if I behave properly that metabeing
will respond positively to me in the future.</p>
<p t="2839820" d="1440">It's true, right?</p>
<p t="2841260" d="1000">You know that.</p>
<p t="2842260" d="5240">If you make a promise to someone and you keep
it, something good is likely going to happen</p>
<p t="2847500" d="1780">to you in the future.</p>
<p t="2849280" d="5380">So that's a God the Father derivation – it's
far more complicated than that, but that's</p>
<p t="2854660" d="1310">not a bad point.</p>
<p t="2855970" d="5570">We kind of figured out that we could bargain
with it across time and that would work.</p>
<p t="2861540" d="4620">I read a really interesting paper by someone
who's actually a former student of mine,</p>
<p t="2866160" d="4810">Azim Shariff, and he analyzed the relationship
between criminal behavior and belief in Hell</p>
<p t="2870970" d="2060">across a whole set of countries.</p>
<p t="2873030" d="4860">I don't know if it was an exhaustive analysis,
correlational analysis.</p>
<p t="2877890" d="5320">It's way more peaceful in countries where
people believe in hell.</p>
<p t="2883210" d="4040">You think should you believe in hell?</p>
<p t="2887250" d="2060">Yes and no.</p>
<p t="2889310" d="3890">Atheist arguments aside, we're not even
going to bother with them because they're</p>
<p t="2893200" d="3020">kind of moronic.</p>
<p t="2896220" d="6610">The idea here is that there are certain action
patterns that if you undertake, you will be</p>
<p t="2902830" d="3910">viciously punished in the future.</p>
<p t="2906740" d="4330">You try lying to everyone you meet and see
how well you'll do in a twenty-year period.</p>
<p t="2911070" d="4750">You're going to be in such trouble by the
end of that twenty-year period that hell will</p>
<p t="2915820" d="4060">be the only accurate way to describe where
you're situated.</p>
<p t="2919880" d="6010">So it's no joke these are real things and
people came up with these ideas for a reason.</p>
<p t="2925890" d="4630">Hell isn't only where other people put you
if you're bad, it's a lot more profound</p>
<p t="2930520" d="1320">a concept than that.</p>
<p t="2931840" d="1810">That's not a bad start.</p>
<p t="2933650" d="5170">Anyways, the sacrificial notion was something
like we cannot do what we want to do right</p>
<p t="2938820" d="3350">now and do something else, and that will make
things better in the future.</p>
<p t="2942170" d="1270">Think about that people.</p>
<p t="2943440" d="4210">That's the most brilliant idea human beings
ever came up with.</p>
<p t="2947650" d="4300">There's this old story, which is probably
not true, about how to catch a monkey.</p>
<p t="2951950" d="5530">You get this jar that's got a pretty thin
neck.</p>
<p t="2957480" d="3600">Just big enough for a monkey to put its hand
in, and you fill it with things monkeys like</p>
<p t="2961080" d="1000">to eat.</p>
<p t="2962080" d="2390">Let's say hard candy for the sake of argument.</p>
<p t="2964470" d="3870">So you put that out there and the monkey goes
and sticks its hand in and grabs a bunch of</p>
<p t="2968340" d="1000">candy.</p>
<p t="2969340" d="3831">It can't get its damn hand out because it's
only big enough for it to put its hand in.</p>
<p t="2973171" d="1439">so then you can just go and pick up the monkey.</p>
<p t="2974610" d="2630">Well, what's the problem with the monkey?</p>
<p t="2977240" d="1980">It can't sacrifice.</p>
<p t="2979220" d="5030">It won't sacrifice its grip on the damn
candy for its future existence.</p>
<p t="2984250" d="4140">That's what your parents have been teaching
you ever since you were little kids.</p>
<p t="2988390" d="2760">Let go of the candy so that you can live.</p>
<p t="2991150" d="2530">That's delay of gratification, right?</p>
<p t="2993680" d="5540">That's contentiousness, that's the discovery
of time and its relationship to the social</p>
<p t="2999220" d="1000">environment.</p>
<p t="3000220" d="2330">It's so brilliant.</p>
<p t="3002550" d="3140">Part of what people were trying to figure
out when they were developing these rituals</p>
<p t="3005690" d="5450">of sacrifice is – okay, so you think about
society as a meta-person, it's usually represented</p>
<p t="3011140" d="4310">as male by the way, but not always, it depends
on the circumstances.</p>
<p t="3015450" d="3370">So what does this meta-person want?</p>
<p t="3018820" d="1490">You have to try to figure that out.</p>
<p t="3020310" d="6150">Part of what it wants is – don't eat all
the damn grain today, save some for next year,</p>
<p t="3026460" d="1020">right?</p>
<p t="3027480" d="5060">Act as if the future exists as part of the
social contact.</p>
<p t="3032540" d="3670">God, that's such a discovery man.</p>
<p t="3036210" d="3390">It's only people who figured that out.</p>
<p t="3039600" d="5640">I mean squirrels have kind of got it in some
sense because they store nuts, and squirrels</p>
<p t="3045240" d="1320">are smart.</p>
<p t="3046560" d="2350">They just kind of got the inkling of it.</p>
<p t="3048910" d="3800">I think what squirrels do is they eat all
of the nuts they can possibly eat right now,</p>
<p t="3052710" d="1740">and then they store the rest of them.</p>
<p t="3054450" d="3639">It wouldn't go hungry if you store nuts
for the future, human beings will do that</p>
<p t="3058089" d="3431">– don't eat the seed grain, right?</p>
<p t="3061520" d="2220">Then you're going to die next year.</p>
<p t="3063740" d="3530">Alright, so back to the hypothalamus.</p>
<p t="3067270" d="4599">Now, you're doing something you want to
do and you're tracking how that's going</p>
<p t="3071869" d="3391">– both of those are hypotheses, by the way.</p>
<p t="3075260" d="2850">All of a sudden something happens that you
don't want to have happen, like you live</p>
<p t="3078110" d="1760">in Flint, Michigan for example.</p>
<p t="3079870" d="4550">So you decide to go have some water and it
turns out that it's not water at all, it's</p>
<p t="3084420" d="1000">led.</p>
<p t="3085420" d="5140">I don't know if you guys know about that,
but it's just the sort of thing that makes</p>
<p t="3090560" d="1430">your jaw drop.</p>
<p t="3091990" d="3540">The state is in big trouble – Michigan.</p>
<p t="3095530" d="5970">So they appointed an auditor to control finances,
I believe at the state level.</p>
<p t="3101500" d="2860">It might have been only at the city level,
but it doesn't matter.</p>
<p t="3104360" d="1160">Let's say the state level.</p>
<p t="3105520" d="3120">So the auditor was looking for ways to save
money and one of the ways they decided to</p>
<p t="3108640" d="6400">save money was to hook up Flint, Michigan's
water supply to a river instead of to the</p>
<p t="3115040" d="2140">great lake, which is what it's right beside.</p>
<p t="3117180" d="6010">Turns out, since Flint was an industrial center
forever, that the water's just full of led.</p>
<p t="3123190" d="4780">So now they have something like fifty thousand
led-poisoned people living in Flint, Michigan.</p>
<p t="3127970" d="1690">That is not a good thing.</p>
<p t="3129660" d="4950">Led lowers your IQ rapidly and it makes you
violent.</p>
<p t="3134610" d="4350">For the ten thousand dollars they saved they
probably cost themselves half a million dollars</p>
<p t="3138960" d="1240">per person.</p>
<p t="3140200" d="5950">It wasn't actually that there was led in
the water it was that the water was more acidic.</p>
<p t="3146150" d="3360">Oh, it took the led out of the pipes, yeah,
good point.</p>
<p t="3149510" d="5390">Well I'm not here to complain about Michigan
politicians, the point is, is that just because</p>
<p t="3154900" d="4060">you think you're out for a drink of water
that does not necessarily mean that's what's</p>
<p t="3158960" d="1000">going on.</p>
<p t="3159960" d="5060">That's why I said that you're comparing
your vision of the future to what you think</p>
<p t="3165020" d="1600">is going on right now.</p>
<p t="3166620" d="6880">Now if you read the neuropsychologists like
Vinagradova, Sokolov and Jeffrey Gray, they're</p>
<p t="3173500" d="1450">basically behaviorists.</p>
<p t="3174950" d="4960">So what they tell you is this – and this
is different – what they tell you is you</p>
<p t="3179910" d="4710">have this little expectancy map that's like
the rat has of its surroundings – it's</p>
<p t="3184620" d="2010">a spatio-temporal map.</p>
<p t="3186630" d="4460">So when you're doing something, you expect
a certain outcome, okay.</p>
<p t="3191090" d="4900">What you compare that to is reality as it
unfolds.</p>
<p t="3195990" d="4500">So you could say, so you've got this map
and then stimuli appear to you, and those</p>
<p t="3200490" d="1350">are objectively real.</p>
<p t="3201840" d="1620">No, that's wrong.</p>
<p t="3203460" d="1080">It's wrong.</p>
<p t="3204540" d="2800">It's interpretation everywhere.</p>
<p t="3207340" d="3880">You think you know what's going on right
now and you think you know what you want.</p>
<p t="3211220" d="4940">The reason I'm making such a big deal out
of this is because look, if you're a rat</p>
<p t="3216160" d="3441">and you're going about your business and
something you don't want happens, according</p>
<p t="3219601" d="8279">to the Gray Behaviorist model, you have to
revamp your expectancy map.</p>
<p t="3227880" d="3450">According to the model that I'm proposing
it's way worse than that, because you don't</p>
<p t="3231330" d="1680">know where the damn error is.</p>
<p t="3233010" d="4580">It might be in the map of what you want, not
what you expect, that's a different thing,</p>
<p t="3237590" d="4530">but it also might be in the map you have that's
of the present.</p>
<p t="3242120" d="5310">So it's not just the map that you have that's
a prediction of your actions that's at fault,</p>
<p t="3247430" d="3330">it could easily be the way you're construing
the world right now.</p>
<p t="3250760" d="6740">It could be error at any level of behavior
and so what it means is when an anomaly occurs,</p>
<p t="3257500" d="6730">it spreads doubt through the entire hierarchy
that we were describing including the future,</p>
<p t="3264230" d="2870">the present and even the past.</p>
<p t="3267100" d="1940">You know this, you know this perfectly well.</p>
<p t="3269040" d="4200">You can see it when you encounter complex
anomaly.</p>
<p t="3273240" d="5600">So a complex anomaly would be you have a long-term
relationship and you get betrayed.</p>
<p t="3278840" d="5190">So betrayed means you've trusted someone
and they enticed you to do so, and then they</p>
<p t="3284030" d="3390">exploit that trust and hurt you.</p>
<p t="3287420" d="3940">For Dante, the betrayers were in the lowest
circle of hell.</p>
<p t="3291360" d="3990">So it's a particularly nasty thing to do
to people.</p>
<p t="3295350" d="4540">If you think about trust as the precondition
for interpersonal relationships, which it</p>
<p t="3299890" d="5290">is, then if someone acts towards you in a
way that violates your trust in trust, then</p>
<p t="3305180" d="3620">they've done you the worst disservice that
someone could possibly be done.</p>
<p t="3308800" d="1970">Okay, so you get betrayed.</p>
<p t="3310770" d="1000">Alright so, bang!</p>
<p t="3311770" d="1160">That's an anomaly.</p>
<p t="3312930" d="1910">What does it imply?</p>
<p t="3314840" d="2450">That's the wrong question.</p>
<p t="3317290" d="3550">The right question is, what doesn't it imply?</p>
<p t="3320840" d="4230">It implies that you just don't have the
foggiest notion of what you're doing or</p>
<p t="3325070" d="3430">what human beings are like.</p>
<p t="3328500" d="3690">Especially if it's a particularly vicious
betrayal, maybe you've been suckered by</p>
<p t="3332190" d="5060">a psychopath, it's like, okay, update your
model and account for that – good luck,</p>
<p t="3337250" d="1960">especially if you're naive.</p>
<p t="3339210" d="5560">The probability that you'll be able to reach
down into the depths far enough to come up</p>
<p t="3344770" d="4920">with a coherent explanation for why someone
would do that is very, very low.</p>
<p t="3349690" d="4570">What I've discovered in my clinical practice
is that if you get betrayed badly enough,</p>
<p t="3354260" d="4870">the only language that you can use to describe
it is fundamentally religious.</p>
<p t="3359130" d="3800">At some points of betrayal it's good versus
evil.</p>
<p t="3362930" d="1340">It's malevolence.</p>
<p t="3364270" d="4440">It's the malevolence that really traumatizes
people.</p>
<p t="3368710" d="3710">It's the fact that that person was out to
hurt you.</p>
<p t="3372420" d="3140">What's a human being like when they're
capable of that?</p>
<p t="3375560" d="1800">It's an age-old question.</p>
<p t="3377360" d="3570">I'll tell you something weird and interesting.</p>
<p t="3380930" d="6890">There's this old idea in Genesis, one of
the first ideas in Genesis, is that God made</p>
<p t="3387820" d="2160">people a paradise to live in.</p>
<p t="3389980" d="5280">Let's just be wild about this for a moment,
and assume that your little model when it's</p>
<p t="3395260" d="2090">going well is a little paradise, right?</p>
<p t="3397350" d="2330">The world's turning out the way you want
it to.</p>
<p t="3399680" d="5920">There's a snake in there somewhere, and
that means – well, why is there a snake?</p>
<p t="3405600" d="3120">There's a bunch of things you're not paying
attention to while you're going about your</p>
<p t="3408720" d="1330">business, right?</p>
<p t="3410050" d="2890">In fact, there are almost an infinite number
of things that you're not paying attention</p>
<p t="3412940" d="1000">to.</p>
<p t="3413940" d="2800">The problem is that one of those infinite
number of things that you're not paying</p>
<p t="3416740" d="2830">attention to can shift on you all of a sudden.</p>
<p t="3419570" d="3400">So there's always this snake in the garden.</p>
<p t="3422970" d="2170">Then you have to figure out what to do with
it.</p>
<p t="3425140" d="4260">The thing is, if you interact with the snake
you get more conscious.</p>
<p t="3429400" d="2160">The problem with that is you lose your little
paradise.</p>
<p t="3431560" d="4610">Okay, well it's worse than that, because
that story is really old.</p>
<p t="3436170" d="1750">We have no idea how old it is.</p>
<p t="3437920" d="5890">It's disseminated all over the world, or
it emerged independently in different places,</p>
<p t="3443810" d="1000">we don't really know.</p>
<p t="3444810" d="1500">In any case it doesn't really matter.</p>
<p t="3446310" d="4680">It's a fundamental enough story – tree
plus snake plus people – that no matter</p>
<p t="3450990" d="3840">where you go some people have tree snake stories.</p>
<p t="3454830" d="4280">I think that's because we lived in trees
for like thirty million years and we got eaten</p>
<p t="3459110" d="1720">by an awful lot of snakes.</p>
<p t="3460830" d="3550">So it's a story that really appeals to us.</p>
<p t="3464380" d="4400">Every bloody science fiction movie you go
to most of the time if the aliens are bad,</p>
<p t="3468780" d="1430">they're always reptilian.</p>
<p t="3470210" d="6230">You don't get furry little koala aliens
that are chasing you around, it's like the</p>
<p t="3476440" d="1000">one's an alien.</p>
<p t="3477440" d="6390">A reptile inside a reptile, they're nasty
beasts, and they come out inside of you even.</p>
<p t="3483830" d="2180">Which is another symbolic idea.</p>
<p t="3486010" d="6770">Okay, so you've always got the damn snake,
and it's popping out all of the time, and</p>
<p t="3492780" d="3260">there's nothing you can do about it except
getting ready to deal with snakes, no getting</p>
<p t="3496040" d="1000">rid of them.</p>
<p t="3497040" d="3940">So that' the first lesson, you're not
getting rid of the damn snakes.</p>
<p t="3500980" d="1730">You better learn to deal with them.</p>
<p t="3502710" d="4770">Then the next question is, what is the worst
possible snake?</p>
<p t="3507480" d="4700">One of the things that happened in Christianity,
and this was influenced in part by Zoroastrianism,</p>
<p t="3512180" d="5410">was the idea of almost an independent evil
arose.</p>
<p t="3517590" d="5150">In fact there was a branch of Christianity
called Manichaeism, that construed the world</p>
<p t="3522740" d="4580">as a battle between good and evil where good
and evil had equal reality.</p>
<p t="3527320" d="1280">They were in this eternal battle.</p>
<p t="3528600" d="6470">Now that got wiped out by the standard Christian
theory that evil was actually just the absence</p>
<p t="3535070" d="4530">of good, which anyways you could have a big
debate about that and people have for thousands</p>
<p t="3539600" d="1360">of years.</p>
<p t="3540960" d="5120">As Christianity developed, there's this
weird mythology that grew up around the weird</p>
<p t="3546080" d="1070">myth of Genesis.</p>
<p t="3547150" d="6270">The weird mythology was that the snake in
the Garden of Eden was also Satan, and that</p>
<p t="3553420" d="1690">he's the king of all evil.</p>
<p t="3555110" d="1320">Okay, what does that mean?</p>
<p t="3556430" d="1260">It's pretty straight- forward.</p>
<p t="3557690" d="3050">What's the worst predator?</p>
<p t="3560740" d="3640">Well that's easy, the worst predator is
a human being.</p>
<p t="3564380" d="4410">The worst of all possible snakes is the most
malevolent possible being.</p>
<p t="3568790" d="4440">That's exactly right, and that's why that
association was made.</p>
<p t="3573230" d="4790">It's so interesting because it took people
thousands of years to make that association.</p>
<p t="3578020" d="6960">It wasn't really put together well until
Milton formalized in Paradise Lost.</p>
<p t="3584980" d="4210">We kind of observe this in action, that there
were bad people.</p>
<p t="3589190" d="2450">Okay, so bad is a category.</p>
<p t="3591640" d="2170">What does bad entail?</p>
<p t="3593810" d="5570">Mythologies of evil center in on what constitutes
bad.</p>
<p t="3599380" d="5050">Carnivorous might be one of the things; malevolent,
out to hurt, right?</p>
<p t="3604430" d="4980">Betrayal, lying, and all of the cardinal great
sins.</p>
<p t="3609410" d="2000">That's the worst snake.</p>
<p t="3611410" d="3280">It's a psychologization of the idea of the
predator.</p>
<p t="3614690" d="6430">It's even more sophisticated than that,
because one branch of that theory is that</p>
<p t="3621120" d="5560">the worst predator is the evil force outside
of you, but the next branch of that is that</p>
<p t="3626680" d="3380">the worst predator is the evil force within
you.</p>
<p t="3630060" d="3980">Yeah, well that's when it gets really psychologized.</p>
<p t="3634040" d="3720">You think, well is that superstition?</p>
<p t="3637760" d="3750">Hey, that's not superstition boys and girls,
it's a lot more intelligent than that.</p>
<p t="3641510" d="5360">It's the most sophisticated theory of the
way things work that we have and it's correct.</p>
<p t="3646870" d="4820">Now what that means from a metaphysical perspective,
we're not going to talk about that because</p>
<p t="3651690" d="5380">we can, but we can certainly talk about what
it means in practical Darwinian terms.</p>
<p t="3657070" d="4460">You better know what's after you, and the
worst thing that could possibly be after you</p>
<p t="3661530" d="4830">is a fully motivated and completely malevolent
human being.</p>
<p t="3666360" d="3080">Skull-crushing cats be damned.</p>
<p t="3669440" d="4130">All they want to do is eat you, they're
not going to torture you; whereas if you fall</p>
<p t="3673570" d="3960">into the hands of the wrong human being man,
you could be in excruciating pain for the</p>
<p t="3677530" d="1830">next twenty years.</p>
<p t="3679360" d="4190">So people are very imaginative if they figure
out how to hurt someone.</p>
<p t="3683550" d="5480">They can keep it up for a long time, and they're
fully motivated to do so under some conditions.</p>
<p t="3689030" d="4790">So you really got to watch out for that.</p>
<p t="3693820" d="1710">Alright so back to the hypothalamus.</p>
<p t="3695530" d="7060">So when you have a mismatch between what you
desire and what you're after, then the hippocampus</p>
<p t="3702590" d="3070">says, “uh, we don't know where we are.”</p>
<p t="3705660" d="1000">That's what it says.</p>
<p t="3706660" d="1590">You no longer know where you are.</p>
<p t="3708250" d="2370">Okay, what should you do when you don't
know where you are?</p>
<p t="3710620" d="1800">You should stop moving.</p>
<p t="3712420" d="2160">Then you should – well then what?</p>
<p t="3714580" d="2420">You should prepare to do a lot of things.</p>
<p t="3717000" d="1140">Okay, then what?</p>
<p t="3718140" d="1000">Then you should explore.</p>
<p t="3719140" d="5240">Well that's where the other half of the
hypothalamus comes in; that dopamanergic circuit</p>
<p t="3724380" d="2330">that mediates positive emotion, right?</p>
<p t="3726710" d="4150">Almost all the positive emotion that you experience
in your life, the kind you like, which is</p>
<p t="3730860" d="8590">hope and curiosity and expectation and surprise
and that's all mediated by the dopamanergic</p>
<p t="3739450" d="1000">systems.</p>
<p t="3740450" d="5500">It's a major-league contributor to the totality
of your being, especially in a positive direction.</p>
<p t="3745950" d="5760">That's rooted in the hypothalamus, so what
that means is that, it's quite cool, you</p>
<p t="3751710" d="4810">got your fundamental motivations, you know
your basic biological motivations, “bang!”</p>
<p t="3756520" d="4800">they fail, that's anxiety, that's a newer
system, and exploration.</p>
<p t="3761320" d="2130">That's an older system.</p>
<p t="3763450" d="3690">That damn exploratory system has been there
forever.</p>
<p t="3767140" d="5810">Now if you look at classic hero mythology,
which we're going to do in great detail,</p>
<p t="3772950" d="7320">what you see is that the typical myth of humanity
is we live in a place, we'll say.</p>
<p t="3780270" d="9590">We have to live in a place, and the place
is doing quite nicely, thank you very much.</p>
<p t="3789860" d="2630">The Hobbits and Frodo.</p>
<p t="3792490" d="3480">So you've got the little shire there, right?</p>
<p t="3795970" d="3780">It's all peaceful, it's full of these
little people who are a little on the arrogant</p>
<p t="3799750" d="3510">side, they're kind of dopey, they have no
idea what the hell's going on in the outside</p>
<p t="3803260" d="5490">world, but they think that's okay, they
think you know, peculiar people are concerned</p>
<p t="3808750" d="1110">about that sort of thing.</p>
<p t="3809860" d="4550">They've got their little happy paradise
going, they live a long time, they eat a lot,</p>
<p t="3814410" d="2880">they party a lot.</p>
<p t="3817290" d="4280">Unbeknownst to them, which is a very interesting
feature of the story, the only reason they</p>
<p t="3821570" d="5910">have any peace at all is because they're
descendants of old kings, continually patrolling</p>
<p t="3827480" d="1960">the borders, right?</p>
<p t="3829440" d="1450">Those are the striders.</p>
<p t="3830890" d="5850">Aragorn, he's the member of the race of
old kings who patrols the borders.</p>
<p t="3836740" d="4100">Those are ancestral figures, it's like you
can all sit here in your little happy paradise,</p>
<p t="3840840" d="5820">but the only reason you can do it is because
the sons of great kings have put borders around</p>
<p t="3846660" d="1370">your kingdom.</p>
<p t="3848030" d="6050">It's funny because in the Hobbit, the Hobbit's
basically despise the Strider, they're very,</p>
<p t="3854080" d="1480">very suspicious of him.</p>
<p t="3855560" d="3990">He's kind of dirty and dusty and he looks
like he's been banged around all over the</p>
<p t="3859550" d="1000">world.</p>
<p t="3860550" d="1000">He's sort of like a tramp.</p>
<p t="3861550" d="3880">They don't know he's the son of a great
king, good thing for them that he is, however.</p>
<p t="3865430" d="3820">Okay, so then you've got the little shire,
what happens?</p>
<p t="3869250" d="2050">Evil things are stirring.</p>
<p t="3871300" d="1040">What is it?</p>
<p t="3872340" d="2230">Well, fundamentally it's a great dragon.</p>
<p t="3874570" d="4090">Well that's a snake, except it's like
a meta-snake.</p>
<p t="3878660" d="2350">It's snake with fire.</p>
<p t="3881010" d="4140">You can be sure that fire was not only one
of our greatest allies, but one of our greatest</p>
<p t="3885150" d="3230">enemies, especially when we lived on the blank
in Africa.</p>
<p t="3888380" d="2280">That thing would burn now and then.</p>
<p t="3890660" d="3850">So, get the hell away from that.</p>
<p t="3894510" d="7630">So anyways, one hobbit, who's woken up by
a wizard – the wizard is the symbol for</p>
<p t="3902140" d="1680">the self from the Jungian perspective.</p>
<p t="3903820" d="4100">So there's one hobbit who's a little bit
more creative and exploratory than the rest</p>
<p t="3907920" d="3540">and everybody has a little respect for him
but they think he's pretty damn peculiar.</p>
<p t="3911460" d="3590">He decides that he's going to, under the
tutelage of the wizard, he's going to go</p>
<p t="3915050" d="1720">check out this dragon.</p>
<p t="3916770" d="4060">So he leaves the borders and goes out into
the unknown.</p>
<p t="3920830" d="3701">Then the rest of it is an adventure and one
of things that's very interesting, again</p>
<p t="3924531" d="4719">from a Jungian perspective, is that, what
does the Hobbit have to become in order to</p>
<p t="3929250" d="1480">conquer the dragon?</p>
<p t="3930730" d="1880">A thief.</p>
<p t="3932610" d="4640">Now that's pretty weird, because you think
hey man, this guy's out being a hero, so</p>
<p t="3937250" d="1380">he should be a hero.</p>
<p t="3938630" d="3130">No, he turns into a thief.</p>
<p t="3941760" d="1000">Why?</p>
<p t="3942760" d="5060">Well it's because if you're going to conquer
a dragon you better be a hell of a lot tougher</p>
<p t="3947820" d="1770">than you are naive.</p>
<p t="3949590" d="4810">So, partly what happens is, for the hobbit
to masker up the forces that are necessary</p>
<p t="3954400" d="10890">for him to confront something that is that
fundamental, he has to transcend the cowardess</p>
<p t="3965290" d="2050">that he describes as morality.</p>
<p t="3967340" d="6170">Okay, so Nietzsche for example, Nietzsche's
often viewed as a critic of morality.</p>
<p t="3973510" d="3359">That's not true.</p>
<p t="3976869" d="3684">Nietzsche identifies morality with cowardess,
but that's not what he does.</p>
<p t="3980553" d="7316">What Nietzsche says is this: if you're too
afraid to do something, so you won't do</p>
<p t="3987869" d="5151">it, then you'll say that the reason you
don't do it is because you're moral.</p>
<p t="3993020" d="1270">That's not the reason.</p>
<p t="3994290" d="2300">The reason is that you're too damn afraid
to do it.</p>
<p t="3996590" d="2790">You might want to, but you're too afraid.</p>
<p t="3999380" d="2000">That doesn't make you moral.</p>
<p t="4001380" d="3960">So what happens to the Hobbit, for example,
once he gets outside of the kingdom, he has</p>
<p t="4005340" d="6500">to develop a whole array of potentials that
he never developed before, because they were</p>
<p t="4011840" d="7100">either not necessary in his civilized place,
or because they were forbidden as immoral</p>
<p t="4018940" d="4280">by the cultural situation that he grew up
in.</p>
<p t="4023220" d="5630">You have to be touched by the snake in order
to defeat the snake.</p>
<p t="4028850" d="3140">Where else have you seen that motif?</p>
<p t="4031990" d="1210">Harry Potter, right?</p>
<p t="4033200" d="4790">Harry Potter's a strange character because
he's not obedient, not at all.</p>
<p t="4037990" d="2170">In fact, he's quite disobedient.</p>
<p t="4040160" d="3860">He breaks the rules in the service of higher
morality.</p>
<p t="4044020" d="5110">The higher morality is that he faces down
the dragon that paralyzes you, and he frees</p>
<p t="4049130" d="1000">the virgin.</p>
<p t="4050130" d="4650">That's what happens with Ginny – Virginia,
Virgin, it's the retelling of Saint George</p>
<p t="4054780" d="1000">and the dragon.</p>
<p t="4055780" d="7010">And interesting enough, the reason that Harry
Potter revivifies, is because Dumbledore's</p>
<p t="4062790" d="3060">phoenix comes by and cries in his wounds.</p>
<p t="4065850" d="4860">Well the phoenix is something that dies and
is reborn and so the meta-myth underlying</p>
<p t="4070710" d="5000">the second-volume of the harry potter series
is that the part of you sustains you through</p>
<p t="4075710" d="5740">an encounter with a dragon that paralyzes,
is the part of you that can die and be reborn.</p>
<p t="4081450" d="4561">What that means in a sense is if you're
wrong about something, and you fall into a</p>
<p t="4086011" d="5289">pit, then you should let go of what you're
wrong about, so that something new can arise.</p>
<p t="4091300" d="6680">So it's better to be the thing that transforms
in response to catastrophe, than it is the</p>
<p t="4097980" d="2100">thing that's static.</p>
<p t="4100080" d="2869">That's another big discovery of people.</p>
<p t="4102949" d="6091">We're agents of transformation, which is
of course why kids are so bloody obsessed</p>
<p t="4109040" d="3840">with magicians and wizards, which are agents
of transformation.</p>
<p t="4112880" d="3390">That's all embedded in the mythology, it's
all acted out.</p>
<p t="4116270" d="2870">Nobody understands this sort of thing to speak
of.</p>
<p t="4119140" d="2780">Certainly the kids don't, it just hits them.</p>
<p t="4121920" d="1660">They can recognize the pattern.</p>
<p t="4123580" d="3340">They know that there's something magical
about them, even though they're living in</p>
<p t="4126920" d="5740">a cupboard in a London suburb, where everything
is boring and flat and under control.</p>
<p t="4132660" d="8260">That's not the real world, and it's true,
it's not.</p>
<p t="4140920" d="8938">Is that why we have more patience for people,
including criminals, who admit their crime</p>
<p t="4149858" d="1000">and do their punishment and redeem themselves?</p>
<p t="4150858" d="1822">Oh not only patience, we often have admiration
for them.</p>
<p t="4152680" d="5270">Oh yeah, how many movies feature attractive
bad guy?</p>
<p t="4157950" d="4500">Well or for that matter, attractive bad woman?</p>
<p t="4162450" d="3690">It's because of the Nietzchian observation.</p>
<p t="4166140" d="3990">The people who are good aren't good, they're
just cowards.</p>
<p t="4170130" d="3470">Whereas the guy who's bad, well at least
he's not a coward.</p>
<p t="4173600" d="4580">Well then you might say, well you know, yeah
he could stop being a coward and also become</p>
<p t="4178180" d="6080">a good guy, but that's often but not always
the actual plot of the movie.</p>
<p t="4184260" d="2599">That's the redemption of the bad guy.</p>
<p t="4186859" d="4811">It's also what woman fantasize about in
relationship to the beauty and the beast mythology.</p>
<p t="4191670" d="1620">They don't want a coward.</p>
<p t="4193290" d="2060">He's the guy that wants to be the friend.</p>
<p t="4195350" d="2210">It's complete bullshit.</p>
<p t="4197560" d="3870">The bad guys going to advance over that – but
not a big enough advance because he's a</p>
<p t="4201430" d="1000">bad guy.</p>
<p t="4202430" d="2970">The best thing you want is a civilized bad
guy.</p>
<p t="4205400" d="1170">That's what you want.</p>
<p t="4206570" d="4260">Well no wonder, because it's only a civilized
bad guy that's going to be capable to be</p>
<p t="4210830" d="1550">dealing with the dragons.</p>
<p t="4212380" d="1470">It's right.</p>
<p t="4213850" d="5030">Lloyd Axworthy, when he was the minister of
Foreign Affairs for Canada, we know the massacres</p>
<p t="4218880" d="1450">were going on in Yugoslavia.</p>
<p t="4220330" d="4860">It was front-page news at one point.</p>
<p t="4225190" d="3160">He said, “I don't have the imagination
for that kind of evil.”</p>
<p t="4228350" d="4860">Oh well, that's really impressive mister
minister of foreign affairs, did you ever</p>
<p t="4233210" d="1060">read about the Holocaust?</p>
<p t="4234270" d="2500">It's like, it's time to wake up a little
bit!</p>
<p t="4236770" d="3040">These things happen, but he said it as a moral
claim.</p>
<p t="4239810" d="2630">I just couldn't imagine that sort of thing
happening.</p>
<p t="4242440" d="2830">Well, you're a little on the naïve said,
aren't you?</p>
<p t="4245270" d="4980">And parading that around as morality is not
a reasonable thing to do when you also happen</p>
<p t="4250250" d="2150">to be Minister of Foreign affairs.</p>
<p t="4252400" d="2390">You should be looking out for the snakes all
of the time.</p>
<p t="4254790" d="5080">They're definitely out there, and Milosevic
was definitely one of them.</p>
<p t="4259870" d="6030">So if a naive person meets someone like that,
the naive person loses.</p>
<p t="4265900" d="3880">That's not good because there's lots of
people like that and it would be better if</p>
<p t="4269780" d="1540">they didn't win.</p>
<p t="4271320" d="8230">So anyways, the fact that the exploratory
circuitry is embedded into the hypothalamus</p>
<p t="4279550" d="5560">way down there with lust and thirst and hunger,
it's so great because it shows you how the</p>
<p t="4285110" d="1240">mythology works.</p>
<p t="4286350" d="4290">It basically says, okay, here's a bunch
of things you're doing now and then they'll</p>
<p t="4290640" d="1000">go wrong.</p>
<p t="4291640" d="2690">You need a system to deal with things when
they go wrong.</p>
<p t="4294330" d="1000">What's the system?</p>
<p t="4295330" d="1720">Well it might kill you, bang!</p>
<p t="4297050" d="3400">You better have some pain and anxiety to protect
you.</p>
<p t="4300450" d="1400">You better figure out what it is.</p>
<p t="4301850" d="3480">Okay, better have an exploratory system so
that you can go out there and gather some</p>
<p t="4305330" d="1230">more information.</p>
<p t="4306560" d="6000">Well that's the human story: gather information
in the face of danger.</p>
<p t="4312560" d="1490">That's the human story.</p>
<p t="4314050" d="2680">That's what we do.</p>
<p t="4316730" d="1330">So that's the hero myth.</p>
<p t="4318060" d="3820">The hero myth is redemptive, and that's
because it is redemptive.</p>
<p t="4321880" d="3850">That is what works, or at least what we've
stated our being on.</p>
<p t="4325730" d="1000">Who knows?</p>
<p t="4326730" d="2580">Maybe all of this exploration will just get
us in trouble.</p>
<p t="4329310" d="2480">That's another part of genesis, right?</p>
<p t="4331790" d="2060">Poke around and see what happens.</p>
<p t="4333850" d="1740">Well you know you're doing that all of the
time.</p>
<p t="4335590" d="4350">You‘re in your little paradise, beedling
away all happily, and then you just can't</p>
<p t="4339940" d="2790">stop yourself from pulling on a thread somewhere.</p>
<p t="4342730" d="4110">Then you find out, oh my God, then maybe that's
when you get suspicious about your partner</p>
<p t="4346840" d="1000">cheating on you.</p>
<p t="4347840" d="3490">You think, maybe this person's cheating
on me, and you can't leave it alone.</p>
<p t="4351330" d="3340">You can't leave it alone, you got to go
look at the snake.</p>
<p t="4354670" d="1520">Turns out it's there!</p>
<p t="4356190" d="2410">Down you go into the underworld.</p>
<p t="4358600" d="7090">You might think, maybe the bliss of ignorance
would have been better.</p>
<p t="4365690" d="3430">Well, it's not like psychologist don't
tell you that.</p>
<p t="4369120" d="3240">All those positive illusion people, that's
there whole shtick.</p>
<p t="4372360" d="3970">It's better to be a little bit dumb about
how things work, because otherwise there's</p>
<p t="4376330" d="1560">no way you can be happy.</p>
<p t="4377890" d="3070">That's an idiotic theory on two accounts.</p>
<p t="4380960" d="5440">A, happy isn't the point, and B, dumb is
not the goal.</p>
<p t="4386400" d="5350">So it's so ignorant that it's actually
corrupt.</p>
<p t="4391750" d="3190">Which is really saying something, because
you have to be pretty damn ignorant before</p>
<p t="4394940" d="1570">you get to corrupt.</p>
<p t="4396510" d="3220">So it's a hell of a thing to teach people.</p>
<p t="4399730" d="4180">You have to delude yourself in a minor way
otherwise you can't stand being alive.</p>
<p t="4403910" d="4470">Oh my God, that's awful, that's really
awful.</p>
<p t="4408380" d="3750">Here's a different story, maybe you're
tough enough to open your eyes.</p>
<p t="4412130" d="2160">That'd be a much better story.</p>
<p t="4414290" d="3630">It's possible too because people are really,
really, really tough.</p>
<p t="4417920" d="4440">It's just that they live in these little
protected places and they never get out there</p>
<p t="4422360" d="5030">and hammer themselves out against the world,
so they never discover that they're tough.</p>
<p t="4427390" d="1230">You might thing, well that's your opinion.</p>
<p t="4428620" d="2340">Well no, it's not my damn opinion.</p>
<p t="4430960" d="5300">We know that if you take someone who's naïve
and paralyzed by anxiety, and you put them</p>
<p t="4436260" d="4310">in psychotherapy and you expose them to the
things that they're afraid of and disgusted</p>
<p t="4440570" d="5820">by and avoiding, that it isn't that they
get less afraid, they get more confident.</p>
<p t="4446390" d="2480">That's what generalizes.</p>
<p t="4448870" d="3280">If you bring someone in who's got a mouse
phobia and you treat the mouse phobia, then</p>
<p t="4452150" d="2220">they're not as afraid of a bunch of other
things.</p>
<p t="4454370" d="1180">Why does that happen?</p>
<p t="4455550" d="4980">They weren't afraid of the damn mouse, they're
afraid of their own inadequacy.</p>
<p t="4460530" d="2730">Then you teach them that they don't have
to be afraid, and then they think , “hey,</p>
<p t="4463260" d="2100">I don't have to be afraid.”</p>
<p t="4465360" d="2629">Then they're not afraid of a whole bunch
of things.</p>
<p t="4467989" d="3651">So you get generalization from behavioral
exposure.</p>
<p t="4471640" d="5620">There's no question about whether or not
exposure to the things that you avoid is curative,</p>
<p t="4477260" d="2250">it's the fundamental axiom of psychotherapy.</p>
<p t="4479510" d="3870">That and figuring out what you're going
to do with your future.</p>
<p t="4483380" d="2880">Even in psychoanalysis it's face what threatens
you.</p>
<p t="4486260" d="3500">It's just that the psychoanalysts go after
past traumas.</p>
<p t="4489760" d="2250">It doesn't matter as far as your brain is
concerned.</p>
<p t="4492010" d="6050">A dangerous thing in the past is exactly the
same thing as a dangerous thing in the present.</p>
<p t="4498060" d="5010">It seems to be partly because the amygdala
doesn't have any sense of time.</p>
<p t="4503070" d="3890">it's interesting because one of the things
Jung observed was that there's no time in</p>
<p t="4506960" d="1150">the collective unconscious.</p>
<p t="4508110" d="2980">It's like everything is an eternal now.</p>
<p t="4511090" d="5810">So let's say you got traumatized when you
were a kid, your amygdala grows; maybe you</p>
<p t="4516900" d="1640">got bitten by a spider.</p>
<p t="4518540" d="4230">You're afraid of that spider then and now
and in the future.</p>
<p t="4522770" d="1320">It's the same.</p>
<p t="4524090" d="2330">It's outside of time.</p>
<p t="4526420" d="2970">The hippocampus is the thing that's dealing
with time.</p>
<p t="4529390" d="5180">So, you know, if you really learn a lesson
it's supposed to be timeless.</p>
<p t="4534570" d="4220">You can still help people overcome their phobias,
but you can't get their damn amygdala to</p>
<p t="4538790" d="1130">shrink again.</p>
<p t="4539920" d="3350">So, you can just get it back under control.</p>
<p t="4543270" d="3520">Okay, so that's pretty cool.</p>
<p t="4546790" d="3980">Then, we could say, let's go up a level
or two.</p>
<p t="4550770" d="5890">Well, let's look at the amygdala for a minute.</p>
<p t="4556660" d="3540">Things about the amygdala have probably changed
since I updated my knowledge, but it doesn't</p>
<p t="4560200" d="3910">really matter because the fundamental systems
I'm telling you about exist.</p>
<p t="4564110" d="9440">They keep moving around in the brain because
we don't know exactly how they work, but</p>
<p t="4573550" d="5350">at a system level of description and using
slightly vague neuropsychology, we can localize</p>
<p t="4578900" d="1670">these sorts of things in the brain.</p>
<p t="4580570" d="3860">Okay so the amygdala gets inputs from everywhere.</p>
<p t="4584430" d="5790">Basically what it's looking for are things
that might threaten you.</p>
<p t="4590220" d="7450">You could say in a sense that the amygdala
has an inbuilt sense of the monstress.</p>
<p t="4597670" d="4960">Let me show you, this is a good time to show
you a comic.</p>
<p t="4602630" d="2140">This is a great comic.</p>
<p t="4604770" d="2590">Someone stoned came up with this comic.</p>
<p t="4607360" d="3690">They really did.</p>
<p t="4611050" d="5540">I really like this comic because it shows
you what's going on perfectly.</p>
<p t="4616590" d="2450">Okay, so there are these hippies.</p>
<p t="4619040" d="3520">They're all friends of this guy named Fat
Freddie.</p>
<p t="4622560" d="1870">They're basically useless hippies.</p>
<p t="4624430" d="4810">They don't pay rent and all they do is smoke
pot.</p>
<p t="4629240" d="4580">Anyways, at one point they make a bunch of
money on some cocaine deal and they buy this</p>
<p t="4633820" d="2390">home out in the country.</p>
<p t="4636210" d="2650">They think they're going to go out there
and live in paradise, so they bring their</p>
<p t="4638860" d="4840">cat along, which is Fat Freddie's cat who
has his own adventures with cockroaches and</p>
<p t="4643700" d="1220">so on.</p>
<p t="4644920" d="4100">Anyways, if you've ever had a cat one thing
you know about cats is they don't like to</p>
<p t="4649020" d="1000">move.</p>
<p t="4650020" d="3000">It makes them very upset and nervous, and
if you put them in a new house they're not</p>
<p t="4653020" d="1190">happy about it.</p>
<p t="4654210" d="3020">The reason for that is you've blown their
map, right?</p>
<p t="4657230" d="5580">The cat will slink around in a new territory
and map every single place and every hiding</p>
<p t="4662810" d="5070">place, obsessively, until it knows what the
hell's going on, and then it will finally</p>
<p t="4667880" d="1000">relax.</p>
<p t="4668880" d="2160">A cat in a new place is not a calm cat.</p>
<p t="4671040" d="5420">A cat in a new place is a nervous cat, which
is also an indication that you don't have</p>
<p t="4676460" d="2020">to learn to be afraid.</p>
<p t="4678480" d="2430">What you have to learn is how to be calm.</p>
<p t="4680910" d="4390">That reverse the way that psychologists generally
talk about anxiety, because they're all</p>
<p t="4685300" d="2790">hobbits and they think that life is safe.</p>
<p t="4688090" d="3680">So because they think that life is safe, you
have to learn to be afraid.</p>
<p t="4691770" d="1450">That's dopey.</p>
<p t="4693220" d="3411">The natural condition is terror and curiosity.</p>
<p t="4696631" d="3719">If you're really lucky now and then, you're
somewhere safe enough so that you don't</p>
<p t="4700350" d="1580">have to be afraid.</p>
<p t="4701930" d="2800">That's tenuous and delicate.</p>
<p t="4704730" d="2440">So what you have to learn is how not to be
afraid.</p>
<p t="4707170" d="1920">Not, how to be afraid.</p>
<p t="4709090" d="2730">Anyways, they got the cat.</p>
<p t="4711820" d="4440">So he's in his box and they take him out
of the box and the cat thinks, “so this</p>
<p t="4716260" d="1000">is the country.”</p>
<p t="4717260" d="5260">So the cat goes really low and starts sniffing,
and that is what animals do when they first</p>
<p t="4722520" d="1070">start exploring.</p>
<p t="4723590" d="5160">Both of those things: they crouch down because
that makes them less visible to predators,</p>
<p t="4728750" d="1000">and they sniff.</p>
<p t="4729750" d="6489">The reason they sniff is because most animals
have their whole brains built around their</p>
<p t="4736239" d="4431">sense of smell; unlike us, where most of our
brain is built around vision.</p>
<p t="4740670" d="5110">Anyways, the cat's slinking around there
and it smells something that it doesn't</p>
<p t="4745780" d="1000">know.</p>
<p t="4746780" d="4270">It thinks, God only knows what this thing
that I don't know is.</p>
<p t="4751050" d="3650">It would freeze first and then it would hastily
retreat.</p>
<p t="4754700" d="2220">So now it's underneath the porch.</p>
<p t="4756920" d="2430">One hippie says, “where'd the cat disappear
now?”</p>
<p t="4759350" d="1780">The other one says, “under the house.”</p>
<p t="4761130" d="4870">The cat's down there shaking, which is what
cats do when they're freaked out like that,</p>
<p t="4766000" d="2360">and it's got it's little fantasy going.</p>
<p t="4768360" d="2160">You'd hide to if you smelled what I did.</p>
<p t="4770520" d="1850">Then it imagines up this monster.</p>
<p t="4772370" d="4530">A monster technically is the amalgamation
of unrelated parts.</p>
<p t="4776900" d="1520">So what's the monster?</p>
<p t="4778420" d="6420">Well its got duck feet and bare arms and its
got a skunk tail and its got kind of a wolf</p>
<p t="4784840" d="1220">head, and its got antlers.</p>
<p t="4786060" d="3100">You think, well that thing doesn't exist.</p>
<p t="4789160" d="1270">That's wrong.</p>
<p t="4790430" d="1000">That thing exists.</p>
<p t="4791430" d="5280">In fact it's a really accurate representation
of what's out there in the forest.</p>
<p t="4796710" d="5130">Any one animal wouldn't look like that,
but the set of all possible animals looks</p>
<p t="4801840" d="1210">exactly like that.</p>
<p t="4803050" d="5370">Then you might think, well what do you want
first, when you're analyzing something?</p>
<p t="4808420" d="3800">Do you want quick and dirty representation
of what to be afraid of?</p>
<p t="4812220" d="3640">Or do you want to hang around trying to figure
out whether that thing has hooves and teeth?</p>
<p t="4815860" d="5330">It's like no, you want a quick and dirty
representation of just what might be lurking</p>
<p t="4821190" d="1240">out there.</p>
<p t="4822430" d="2100">That's intelligent hypothesizing.</p>
<p t="4824530" d="3500">It's the kind of hypothesizing that would
be evolutionary driven.</p>
<p t="4828030" d="5310">Did you ever see the far side cartoon, Monster
Snorkel?</p>
<p t="4833340" d="2050">I love that cartoon.</p>
<p t="4835390" d="5380">There's this little kid in his bed, it's
dark and he's under cover.</p>
<p t="4840770" d="3580">He's one of those ugly little kids that
Gary Larson always drew.</p>
<p t="4844350" d="6680">He's got this snorkel that you use for scuba
diving.</p>
<p t="4851030" d="3420">Snorkeling, not scuba diving.</p>
<p t="4854450" d="4910">All that's sticking out from under the covers
is his snorkel so that he can breathe.</p>
<p t="4859360" d="6580">Of course in his imagination there's some
reptilian dinosaur sitting beside his bed.</p>
<p t="4865940" d="1270">Well, why?</p>
<p t="4867210" d="2540">That's what he's hypothesizing.</p>
<p t="4869750" d="1000">Why?</p>
<p t="4870750" d="3250">Because that's what's in the dark.</p>
<p t="4874000" d="3800">You can tell your kid, there's no monsters
in the dark.</p>
<p t="4877800" d="2189">Then you tell your kid to never talk to a
stranger.</p>
<p t="4879989" d="1881">Well get your story straight people.</p>
<p t="4881870" d="1000">Really?</p>
<p t="4882870" d="1340">It's so dopey.</p>
<p t="4884210" d="3050">Yes there are monsters in the dark.</p>
<p t="4887260" d="1000">What do you tell your kids?</p>
<p t="4888260" d="1780">No, there's no such thing as monsters.</p>
<p t="4890040" d="5170">First of all they're driven half crazy because
they think what am I afraid of then?</p>
<p t="4895210" d="4170">Second, you tell them all of the time that
there are monsters in the dark.</p>
<p t="4899380" d="4490">In fact you're probably more paranoid about
the things than your damn kid is.</p>
<p t="4903870" d="1190">So what do you tell them?</p>
<p t="4905060" d="4270">There are monsters in the dark but you can
probably handle them, especially with our</p>
<p t="4909330" d="1000">help.</p>
<p t="4910330" d="2420">Okay, so now I'll tell you a story.</p>
<p t="4912750" d="7920">So my nephew, he was six, and he had night
terrors.</p>
<p t="4920670" d="4110">Night terrors are this strange phenomena where
all of a sudden you wake up screaming.</p>
<p t="4924780" d="2720">It's quite unpleasant.</p>
<p t="4927500" d="2100">You might say, well why is this happening?</p>
<p t="4929600" d="4170">The answer is that we really don't know
but there was some instability in his household</p>
<p t="4933770" d="1000">at that point.</p>
<p t="4934770" d="3600">A, he was just going off to kindergarten,
so that's a big transition.</p>
<p t="4938370" d="2760">It's out of paradise and out into the world.</p>
<p t="4941130" d="6120">B, his parents were in the throws of approaching
divorce, so there was that sort of undercurrent</p>
<p t="4947250" d="1000">in the house.</p>
<p t="4948250" d="1360">You know what that's like.</p>
<p t="4949610" d="3100">You walk into a house like that and you know
something's up.</p>
<p t="4952710" d="1730">It's like the air is frozen.</p>
<p t="4954440" d="3360">It's probably something you can smell, I
think.</p>
<p t="4957800" d="3710">Whatever, it doesn't matter, but you can
certainly tell.</p>
<p t="4961510" d="3050">So anyways, he's waking up at night screaming
away.</p>
<p t="4964560" d="2650">He's a very verbal kid.</p>
<p t="4967210" d="4090">During the day he's running around, I guess
he was about four, not six.</p>
<p t="4971300" d="2230">He's got this little night hat that he wears.</p>
<p t="4973530" d="1120">It's a plastic night hat.</p>
<p t="4974650" d="4170">So he zooms around with that all of the time,
and he's got this plastic sword, and he</p>
<p t="4978820" d="1000">zooms around with that too.</p>
<p t="4979820" d="2270">So you think what's he up to?</p>
<p t="4982090" d="4451">He's playing knight, which is kind of weird
in a way.</p>
<p t="4986541" d="4479">Because you'd think why would being a knight
be attractive to a kid?</p>
<p t="4991020" d="1690">We weren't knights for that long.</p>
<p t="4992710" d="1450">Whatever, it doesn't really matter.</p>
<p t="4994160" d="2900">He was running around playing knight.</p>
<p t="4997060" d="4340">He goes to sleep and he puts his knight hat
and is sword right beside his bed.</p>
<p t="5001400" d="2010">So fine, I watch that.</p>
<p t="5003410" d="3020">I'm watching what's going on with them
and I'm figuring out what's going on in</p>
<p t="5006430" d="1000">the house.</p>
<p t="5007430" d="2380">His mom is worried because he's having night
terrors.</p>
<p t="5009810" d="2640">Yeah, it's horrible he wakes up screaming.</p>
<p t="5012450" d="1990">So okay, nighttime comes.</p>
<p t="5014440" d="4480">He wakes up screaming, we're all sitting
at the breakfast table the next day.</p>
<p t="5018920" d="3350">I said, did you dream about anything?</p>
<p t="5022270" d="1070">He said, yeah!</p>
<p t="5023340" d="7230">He got right into this dream and he said okay,
this is what happened: I was out in a field</p>
<p t="5030570" d="3080">and all of these little dwarfs were around
me.</p>
<p t="5033650" d="3660">They only came up to my knees but they had
big beaks, they didn't have any arms, but</p>
<p t="5037310" d="2090">they had big beaks.</p>
<p t="5039400" d="2720">They were covered with hair and grease, so
they were all greased down.</p>
<p t="5042120" d="4430">There was a cross-shave at the top of their
head, and wherever I went these beaked dwarfs</p>
<p t="5046550" d="4130">would jump at me with their feet and bite
me.</p>
<p t="5050680" d="2720">They're everywhere!</p>
<p t="5053400" d="3860">Everyone stops eating breakfast to look at
this kid, thinking, wow no wonder why you're</p>
<p t="5057260" d="2120">screaming man.</p>
<p t="5059380" d="5630">Then he said, yeah, and it was worse than
that because there was smoke and at the back</p>
<p t="5065010" d="4330">of the dwarfs there was this dragon and the
dragon was breathing out smoke and fire and</p>
<p t="5069340" d="1810">the smoke and fire would turn into the dwarfs.</p>
<p t="5071150" d="2680">Oh my God, what do you do about that?</p>
<p t="5073830" d="4080">Wiping out some dwarfs, who cares, but the
dragon will just breathe up some more.</p>
<p t="5077910" d="1990">That's life man.</p>
<p t="5079900" d="6610">I've got this excellent picture, let me
show it to you because it's worth finding,</p>
<p t="5086510" d="27500">even though it's going to interrupt my story
a little bit.</p>
<p t="5114010" d="2380">Well I'm not going to find it because it
will take too long, but I'll tell you what</p>
<p t="5116390" d="1000">it is.</p>
<p t="5117390" d="2280">It's a Greek amphora.</p>
<p t="5119670" d="5680">You know amphora, it's like a vase, and
people used to keep wine in them.</p>
<p t="5125350" d="4460">It's painted on like a cartoon, it's sort
of black and white.</p>
<p t="5129810" d="3820">It's got this hero, who I believe is Hercules.</p>
<p t="5133630" d="3450">Hercules is facing this snake, and it's
a really cool snake.</p>
<p t="5137080" d="3730">So first of all it's tail is curled in a
perfect circle.</p>
<p t="5140810" d="7120">If you look at dragons and snakes in mythology,
their tales are often curled in a circle.</p>
<p t="5147930" d="3590">It means something like infinity.</p>
<p t="5151520" d="2050">Then there are all these snakes – it's
a hydra.</p>
<p t="5153570" d="2470">It's a snake with eight heads.</p>
<p t="5156040" d="3540">Then there's Hercules with his sword – well,
what's the problem with the hydra?</p>
<p t="5159580" d="5210">You cut off one head and eight more heads
grow.</p>
<p t="5164790" d="7210">Quit cutting off heads – it's a good piece
of foreign policy advice for the middle east.</p>
<p t="5172000" d="1360">The hydras keep growing.</p>
<p t="5173360" d="3010">Okay, so cutting off heads isn't going to
be of any utility.</p>
<p t="5176370" d="4840">Here's what the story is saying: no matter
how many problems you solve there's going</p>
<p t="5181210" d="3460">to be a bunch more problems and it's even
worse than that.</p>
<p t="5184670" d="3819">If you have a problem and you solve it that's
going to lead to more problems.</p>
<p t="5188489" d="1891">So even the solution is a problem.</p>
<p t="5190380" d="2600">That's the law of unexpected consequences.</p>
<p t="5192980" d="3080">That's why automobiles have destroyed the
atmosphere.</p>
<p t="5196060" d="4710">Everybody thought an automobile is for getting
from point A to point B. It turns out it's</p>
<p t="5200770" d="1000">not.</p>
<p t="5201770" d="3780">It's for turning the world's holes into
jungles.</p>
<p t="5205550" d="1720">We didn't know that.</p>
<p t="5207270" d="3000">So that's an unexpected consequence.</p>
<p t="5210270" d="4240">So anyways, the kid is faced with this horrible
conundrum.</p>
<p t="5214510" d="1000">What am I going to do?</p>
<p t="5215510" d="3100">I've got these stupid dwarfs and then there's
this dragon.</p>
<p t="5218610" d="4920">So I said, what could you do about that?</p>
<p t="5223530" d="3600">Now that's called a loaded question and
it would be inadmissible in a court of law</p>
<p t="5227130" d="7450">in a sense because it's a question – but
it isn't because I'm telling him something.</p>
<p t="5234580" d="3909">You could do something about that.</p>
<p t="5238489" d="1401">Well that's a hell of a theory.</p>
<p t="5239890" d="3180">Well yeah, I should just lay down and let
the dwarfs eat me.</p>
<p t="5243070" d="2250">No, no you could do something about it, I
said.</p>
<p t="5245320" d="1060">What could you do?</p>
<p t="5246380" d="6540">Then he said, I'd put my hat on, I'd get
my sword, then I'd go get my dad and we'd</p>
<p t="5252920" d="1000">go up to the dragon.</p>
<p t="5253920" d="4130">I would jump on his head and then I'd poke
both his eyes out with my sword and then I'd</p>
<p t="5258050" d="4270">go right down to his stomach to the place
where the fire comes out and I'd cut a piece</p>
<p t="5262320" d="3320">off of that and I'd use it as a shield.</p>
<p t="5265640" d="2410">And I thought, “right on, kid!</p>
<p t="5268050" d="1000">You got it.”</p>
<p t="5269050" d="2730">It was so cool because he had the whole thing,
eh.</p>
<p t="5271780" d="1689">That's why he was running around playing
knight.</p>
<p t="5273469" d="5741">He'd almost got it, and all I had to do
was drop – there's this fifth chemical</p>
<p t="5279210" d="2670">phenomena called a super-saturated solution.</p>
<p t="5281880" d="1040">It's kind of cool.</p>
<p t="5282920" d="7350">So if you take - water can only dissolve so
much sugar until the sugar starts to crystallize</p>
<p t="5290270" d="4530">out.</p>
<p t="5294800" d="8020">If you really slowly cool down then water
and you don't tap it there's no impurities.</p>
<p t="5302820" d="4910">You can get the solution super saturated which
means, weirdly enough, it holds more sugar</p>
<p t="5307730" d="1450">than it can.</p>
<p t="5309180" d="5360">It's like it forgets to crystallize or maybe
it needs a little impurity or shock or something</p>
<p t="5314540" d="2930">to get it going, but it's like it forgets
to crystallize.</p>
<p t="5317470" d="2697">So then if you take a little crystal of sugar
and you drop it in, it's like it goes “sound”</p>
<p t="5320167" d="3873">and instantly it's all crystals.</p>
<p t="5324040" d="5260">So that's what happened to this kid: he
was there, he was ready, he had to answer,</p>
<p t="5329300" d="6490">and all I had to do was say you could do something
about this and “poof!” instant hero myth.</p>
<p t="5335790" d="6080">The cool thing is no more night terrors.</p>
<p t="5341870" d="3130">So you get the picture, it's very, very
cool.</p>
<p t="5345000" d="4600">Alright so, back to our discussion.</p>
<p t="5349600" d="14860">Now, alright so you've got the brain here.</p>
<p t="5364460" d="13280">This is the brain as conceptualized by Alexander
Luria, who was Russia's most famous neuropsychologist.</p>
<p t="5377740" d="4650">So basically he said that there's a bunch
of different ways you can divide up the brain.</p>
<p t="5382390" d="4270">It depends on what you want, which is an interesting
way of thinking about it.</p>
<p t="5386660" d="4040">Because you might say well how should you
divide up the world and the answer is it depends</p>
<p t="5390700" d="1539">on what you want.</p>
<p t="5392239" d="5521">It depends on some degree of the world, but
it depends even more on what you want.</p>
<p t="5397760" d="5129">So one of the things Luria said was if you
go from the back to the front of the brain</p>
<p t="5402889" d="4661">– the front's the grey part here – what
you see is, roughly speaking, the back half</p>
<p t="5407550" d="5150">of the brain does sensory processing, especially
visual processing, and the front half of the</p>
<p t="5412700" d="1710">brain does motor processing.</p>
<p t="5414410" d="4570">Okay, and so if you look at the back of the
brain the sensory unit there, you see there's</p>
<p t="5418980" d="2210">an auditory area and a visual area.</p>
<p t="5421190" d="3540">What's cool is those overlap to some degree.</p>
<p t="5424730" d="5020">So there's some hypothesis that the place
where the sensory systems overlap are the</p>
<p t="5429750" d="5180">parts that are responsible for your experience
of a unified perceptual field.</p>
<p t="5434930" d="4390">So here's an example: imagine the visual
cortex and the auditory cortex overlap in</p>
<p t="5439320" d="1000">once place.</p>
<p t="5440320" d="5520">Okay, so it would sort of be here, about there
on the left side.</p>
<p t="5445840" d="2649">That's the part you use for silent reading.</p>
<p t="5448489" d="2000">Isn't that cool?</p>
<p t="5450489" d="2061">It means your using your eyes as ears.</p>
<p t="5452550" d="3840">The way you do that is you use the overlap
between the visual and the auditory cortex.</p>
<p t="5456390" d="4000">It's so cool, you can use your eyes as ears.</p>
<p t="5460390" d="3050">So the senses aren't as separate as people
think.</p>
<p t="5463440" d="3950">I used to wear glasses and I couldn't hear
what people were saying when I wasn't wearing</p>
<p t="5467390" d="1000">them.</p>
<p t="5468390" d="2430">The reason for that is I wasn't watching
their lips.</p>
<p t="5470820" d="3860">So a lot of what I was hearing in language
processing was the expression on their face</p>
<p t="5474680" d="1300">and the movement of their lips.</p>
<p t="5475980" d="2510">I take off my glasses, and I'm deaf.</p>
<p t="5478490" d="2950">So anyways, that's the sensory unit, half
of the brain.</p>
<p t="5481440" d="3250">Most of it's the visual cortex because we're
visual creatures.</p>
<p t="5484690" d="2049">The front half is the motor unit.</p>
<p t="5486739" d="1171">Okay, why?</p>
<p t="5487910" d="3309">Well because we proceed and act.</p>
<p t="5491219" d="3011">So it's the part of the brain that's responsible
for zipping you around.</p>
<p t="5494230" d="2420">You've got voluntary action, right?</p>
<p t="5496650" d="6530">You inhabit a nervous system that enables
you to navigate your way around the world.</p>
<p t="5503180" d="1289">We're navigators, fundamentally.</p>
<p t="5504469" d="3541">We really are navigators.</p>
<p t="5508010" d="3000">You know ants can navigate by the stars?</p>
<p t="5511010" d="1000">Think about that.</p>
<p t="5512010" d="2520">How the hell can an ant navigate by the stars?</p>
<p t="5514530" d="5060">They figured that out by watching ants figure
out how to get back, and then covering up</p>
<p t="5519590" d="3670">the sky, and then the ants would wander around
not knowing where they were going.</p>
<p t="5523260" d="3810">Yeah there's lots of things we don't understand,
I can tell you that.</p>
<p t="5527070" d="1840">So anyways, the motor unit.</p>
<p t="5528910" d="2320">You've got the motor strip.</p>
<p t="5531230" d="4580">Now if you touch that with an electrode during
brain surgery then people will either move</p>
<p t="5535810" d="4640">or have the impulse to move and you can map
out how the body is represented in the brain</p>
<p t="5540450" d="4010">by touching that strip with an electrode,
and that was done by Wilmer Penfield at the</p>
<p t="5544460" d="1460">Montreal Neurological Institute.</p>
<p t="5545920" d="5330">It was a major move forward in the understanding
of the brain and he did that on epileptics</p>
<p t="5551250" d="4310">before surgery, because he didn't want to
take out parts of the brain that were necessary</p>
<p t="5555560" d="2170">so he was trying to figure out what they were
doing.</p>
<p t="5557730" d="4290">So that's the part that enables you to act
voluntarily, and in front of that there's</p>
<p t="5562020" d="2340">the premotor strip.</p>
<p t="5564360" d="2670">In front of that there's the prefrontal
cortex.</p>
<p t="5567030" d="6680">Now, what's cool is that the premotor strip
and the prefrontal cortex grew out of the</p>
<p t="5573710" d="2450">motor strip over the course of evolution.</p>
<p t="5576160" d="3450">So then you might say, well why do we think?</p>
<p t="5579610" d="3710">The answer isn't so that we can come up
with accurate, objective representations of</p>
<p t="5583320" d="1000">the world.</p>
<p t="5584320" d="2880">The answer is, so that we can plan what to
do.</p>
<p t="5587200" d="7260">What you see, fundamentally, is that as you
move forward in the brain you go from action</p>
<p t="5594460" d="1940">to planning action.</p>
<p t="5596400" d="3830">So by the time you get to the prefrontal cortex,
let's say the dorsal-lateral prefrontal</p>
<p t="5600230" d="4580">cortex, which is the part of the brain that
you use for abstract thinking, what you're</p>
<p t="5604810" d="8970">basically doing is conjuring up avatars of
yourself in an imaginary world, running them</p>
<p t="5613780" d="4490">as simulations in your imagination, and the
collective imagination, that's what stories</p>
<p t="5618270" d="4640">are, running the simulation until the end
to see if you live or die.</p>
<p t="5622910" d="2830">If you die then you don't implement the
simulation.</p>
<p t="5625740" d="3530">If you live and thrive then you do implement
the situation.</p>
<p t="5629270" d="7930">So – who was it – Carl Popper, philosopher
of science said, the reason we think is so</p>
<p t="5637200" d="3000">we can let our thoughts die instead of us.</p>
<p t="5640200" d="3090">Right, that's smart.</p>
<p t="5643290" d="3350">That also ties into the death and rebirth
idea, right?</p>
<p t="5646640" d="4460">Are you going to die, or are you going to
let your avatars die?</p>
<p t="5651100" d="6610">One way of thinking about that is that your
current self is just an avatar.</p>
<p t="5657710" d="3780">Now if you understand that, that means you
also understand the relationship between the</p>
<p t="5661490" d="3720">Jungian self and the ego.</p>
<p t="5665210" d="3370">The ego is an avatar, the self is the thing.</p>
<p t="5668580" d="5020">Now I don't know if you know this, but the
word avatar is actually a theological term.</p>
<p t="5673600" d="2670">It's from Sand script.</p>
<p t="5676270" d="3450">An avatar is the form that a God takes on
earth.</p>
<p t="5679720" d="4249">It's pretty cool that that turned into the
term for the thing you use in a video game.</p>
<p t="5683969" d="4951">That's your little, disposable self.</p>
<p t="5688920" d="3130">You throw it out there in the world and it
can live or die, and you're back there like</p>
<p t="5692050" d="2830">God just being eternal all along the way.</p>
<p t="5694880" d="3170">So, that's a very, very weird thing.</p>
<p t="5698050" d="3040">Anyways, even before we had video games we
were doing that.</p>
<p t="5701090" d="6149">We had fiction, we had stories, we had imagination,
and it's decoupled from our motor systems.</p>
<p t="5707239" d="6541">So we can implement these hypothetical instances
of ourselves before we implement them.</p>
<p t="5713780" d="1720">That's kind of how we fight Hydras.</p>
<p t="5715500" d="2750">Okay, so you have eight snakes, what do you
do about that?</p>
<p t="5718250" d="2219">You have eight potential selves.</p>
<p t="5720469" d="4581">You multiply potential selves just as fast
as you multiply snakes.</p>
<p t="5725050" d="3790">That's what evolution does, right?</p>
<p t="5728840" d="3690">Let's say you've got a mongoose.</p>
<p t="5732530" d="4110">Mongoose like to eat snakes, they're really
good at it.</p>
<p t="5736640" d="1000">They can eat cobras.</p>
<p t="5737640" d="1000">Go Mongoose!</p>
<p t="5738640" d="3250">So you think, well a mongoose gets killed
by a cobra.</p>
<p t="5741890" d="3680">Well that's not a very good mongoose but
that doesn't matter because the mongoose</p>
<p t="5745570" d="4100">are generating all sorts of mongoose, and
one of them is going to be able to kill the</p>
<p t="5749670" d="1000">snake.</p>
<p t="5750670" d="1870">That's all that really matters.</p>
<p t="5752540" d="5650">There's a very funny mouse that lives in
the desert in Arizona.</p>
<p t="5758190" d="3509">I like this mouse a lot, and it jumps.</p>
<p t="5761699" d="3191">It's so cool, this mouse, it feeds on scorpions.</p>
<p t="5764890" d="2790">How the hell did it learn to do that?</p>
<p t="5767680" d="4720">Anyways, it has to teach its young to eat
scorpions, and its quite immune from scorpion</p>
<p t="5772400" d="2130">venom, which is quite helpful.</p>
<p t="5774530" d="5040">Still it goes out – it's like you going
out to wrestle a blank crocodile – it's</p>
<p t="5779570" d="3190">like a scorpion is a big thing compared to
a mouse.</p>
<p t="5782760" d="2970">The mouse will hop on to the scorpion and
they have this terrible fight, and finally</p>
<p t="5785730" d="1270">the mouse tears it a part.</p>
<p t="5787000" d="3739">Then it brings it back and feeds it to its
mice babies.</p>
<p t="5790739" d="2441">Do you know what it does then?</p>
<p t="5793180" d="3870">It goes outside and howls at the moon like
a wolf.</p>
<p t="5797050" d="7580">It sounds like a mouse so it's really squeaky,
but if you slow it down, you know, which is</p>
<p t="5804630" d="5070">what you have to do if you want to, for example,
hear mouse vocalizations, because they're</p>
<p t="5809700" d="4490">often much higher than your threshold for
hearing.</p>
<p t="5814190" d="5060">Blank that, to hear a rat's laugh when you
tickle them, you have to slow down their vocalizations</p>
<p t="5819250" d="5060">because they laugh at ultrasonic frequencies,
so you have to slow down your vocalizations</p>
<p t="5824310" d="1820">to hear them laugh when you tickle them.</p>
<p t="5826130" d="4700">Anyways, these damn mice go out in the desert
at night, after eating a scorpion, and they</p>
<p t="5830830" d="1810">howl at the moon.</p>
<p t="5832640" d="3020">Go mice.</p>
<p t="5835660" d="5289">So anyways, back to the brain here.</p>
<p t="5840949" d="3621">There are all of these terrible monsters being
generated.</p>
<p t="5844570" d="4480">You generate avatars of yourself to cope with
them, and generally used to have to evolve</p>
<p t="5849050" d="4880">to do that, but human beings, being the smart
creatures that we are, generated up an environment</p>
<p t="5853930" d="5410">in the imagination and then populated it with
imaginary representations of ourselves, and</p>
<p t="5859340" d="1540">then tried those out.</p>
<p t="5860880" d="2819">Then we implement the ones that we think are
great.</p>
<p t="5863699" d="4411">Then you might think, well we've been doing
that for a very, very, very long time.</p>
<p t="5868110" d="4800">then you might think, maybe we've figured
out exactly what thing we should implement,</p>
<p t="5872910" d="4760">then we might say well that's the savior
figures in mythology.</p>
<p t="5877670" d="2610">That's what they are.</p>
<p t="5880280" d="1939">What else would they be?</p>
<p t="5882219" d="3061">People have been trying to figure out what
the hell we are forever.</p>
<p t="5885280" d="5560">The fundamental question, what is reality
made of, is not the fundamental question.</p>
<p t="5890840" d="4250">The fundamental question is, how do you act
in the world?</p>
<p t="5895090" d="3420">That's a whole different way of thinking
about the world, but I think, given that I'm</p>
<p t="5898510" d="5260">a Darwinian, I think it's the fundamental
question.</p>
<p t="5903770" d="6150">You know, obviously, given what I've described
to you so far, you can't fall in love too</p>
<p t="5909920" d="3170">much with your current self.</p>
<p t="5913090" d="1060">What if it's wrong?</p>
<p t="5914150" d="1700">Then you should let that sucker die.</p>
<p t="5915850" d="5260">Then you might think, well what part of you
is it that doesn't die when your avatars</p>
<p t="5921110" d="1000">die.</p>
<p t="5922110" d="1640">Well that's what Jung called the self.</p>
<p t="5923750" d="2750">Let's say you undergo a personality transformation.</p>
<p t="5926500" d="3969">There's the old you, you're all naïve
and something comes along and just wallops</p>
<p t="5930469" d="1000">you, bang!</p>
<p t="5931469" d="1491">Into the underworld, you fall apart.</p>
<p t="5932960" d="1000">Then, bang!</p>
<p t="5933960" d="1900">There's a new you.</p>
<p t="5935860" d="3320">Maybe a little battle weary, but wiser.</p>
<p t="5939180" d="5510">Then you know that one gets walloped out and
into the underworld and up you come again.</p>
<p t="5944690" d="3259">Fine, what's constant across all of those
transformations?</p>
<p t="5947949" d="3521">That's the core element of the person.</p>
<p t="5951470" d="3010">That's what Jung called the self.</p>
<p t="5954480" d="7509">Brilliant, it's so smart.</p>
