<p t="5960" d="5800">[Interviewer]: Dr Peterson, you&#39;ve mentioned these ideas of responsibility, of virtue, of respect.</p>
<p t="12120" d="6240">You&#39;ve, I think, detailed what you think students shouldn&#39;t do in these examples of like, protests</p>
<p t="18560" d="2640">and these examples of certain types of activist tactics.</p>
<p t="21200" d="4740">What advice would you have for students? How can students make the changes that they want to make?</p>
<p t="25940" d="2740">Particularly, do you have any advice for students here?</p>
<p t="28680" d="1940">[Peterson]: Yeah, read great books.</p>
<p t="30940" d="6420">Really, man, you&#39;ve got this four year period that has been carved out of your lives by society.</p>
<p t="37580" d="3580">It&#39;s given you an identity, like a high quality identity,</p>
<p t="41160" d="3420">and freedom at the same time - and you&#39;re not gonna get that again in your life.</p>
<p t="44580" d="4400">You&#39;ve got a respectable identity: University Student.</p>
<p t="48980" d="3500">And complete freedom associated with that, or as near as you&#39;re ever gonna get.</p>
<p t="52480" d="4140">And you&#39;ve got these unbelievable libraries that are full of the writings of people who are</p>
<p t="56620" d="2920">intelligent and articulate beyond comprehension.</p>
<p t="59540" d="5680">And you can go there and you can learn all this...and you might think, well, &quot;why should you learn it?&quot;</p>
<p t="65760" d="5920">Well, you learn it to get a job, or you learn it to get good grades, or you learn it to get a degree...and that&#39;s all nonsense.</p>
<p t="71680" d="1140">It&#39;s nonsense.</p>
<p t="72820" d="7280">The reason that you come to university to be educated is because there is nothing more powerful that someone who is articulate and who can think and speak.</p>
<p t="80240" d="3060">It&#39;s power, and I mean power of the best sort:</p>
<p t="83300" d="3480">It&#39;s authority and influence and respectability and competence.</p>
<p t="86780" d="3200">And so you come to university to craft your highest skill.</p>
<p t="89980" d="3460">And your highest skill is to be found in articulated speech.</p>
<p t="93440" d="5880">And if you&#39;re a master at formulating your arguments, you win everything.</p>
<p t="99500" d="4680">And better than that, when you win everything, everyone around you wins too.</p>
<p t="104320" d="7440">Because to transform yourself into, let&#39;s consider your transformation into something approximating the Logos,</p>
<p t="111760" d="2420">it means you shine a light on the whole world.</p>
<p t="114360" d="3940">Well there&#39;s nothing more exciting to do than that, there&#39;s nothing better you can possibly do.</p>
<p t="118300" d="3980">And to think that you&#39;re coming to university to be trained to have a job, it&#39;s like,</p>
<p t="122280" d="4380">&quot;Great, that&#39;s a hell of a lot better than to  be unemployed and covered with cheeto dust while you&#39;re</p>
<p t="126680" d="2780">snacking away in front of your video game in the basement&quot;,</p>
<p t="129460" d="4700">but it&#39;s not...and I don&#39;t have anything against video games by the way...</p>
<p t="134240" d="2260">(Laughter)</p>
<p t="137020" d="4240">But it&#39;s hardly a triumphant call to being in the world</p>
<p t="141260" d="1980">and that&#39;s what universities should be calling forth.</p>
<p t="143360" d="2000">It&#39;s like, God, you people you...</p>
<p t="145360" d="2900">I know what Harvard students are like - I taught here for 5 years .</p>
<p t="148260" d="3440">You people are spectacular, you&#39;re spectacular.</p>
<p t="151700" d="3420">You&#39;re all capable of being world beaters.</p>
<p t="155120" d="2880">You transform yourself into something that&#39;s articulated,</p>
<p t="158000" d="3580">and sensible, and grounded in history, and knowledgeable and wise,</p>
<p t="161580" d="3640">you can do anything you want, and hopefully anything you want for good;</p>
<p t="165220" d="4760">because if you have any sense, everything you wanna do would be for the good, because there&#39;s nothing more</p>
<p t="169980" d="2240">compelling, or meaningful, or</p>
<p t="172220" d="3460">or useful in combating the tragedy of life than to</p>
<p t="175680" d="4340">than to struggle with all your soul on behalf of the good!</p>
<p t="180020" d="4420">And the universities have forgotten that. It&#39;s why everyone&#39;s bailing out of the humanities.</p>
<p t="184440" d="2580">And they should - the humanities are corrupt.</p>
<p t="187020" d="4340">And they&#39;re corrupt because they&#39;re not telling students this. It&#39;s so bloody obvious.</p>
<p t="191360" d="4980">It&#39;s like, &quot;learn to think, learn to speak, learn to read.&quot;</p>
<p t="196340" d="4040">It makes you a superpower, an individual superpower.</p>
<p t="202140" d="4160">I don&#39;t understand why that isn&#39;t just told to students.</p>
<p t="206300" d="2940">It&#39;s not that hard to understand, and everyone wants to hear it;</p>
<p t="209240" d="2580">It&#39;s like &quot;really, I could do that, I could do that?&quot;</p>
<p t="211820" d="2040">Yeah, really, you could do that.</p>
<p t="213860" d="4380">And the whole society around you has labored for thousands of years</p>
<p t="218240" d="4240">to provide every single one of you with this spectacular opportunity that you have</p>
<p t="222480" d="2680">while you&#39;re undergraduates and graduate students here.</p>
<p t="225160" d="6300">Everyone&#39;s just praying that you would come here and manifest everything that you could manifest!</p>
<p t="231460" d="3640">And that&#39;s what you should be doing, instead of waving placards</p>
<p t="235100" d="3100">and complaining about how you&#39;re oppressed, for God&#39;s sake!</p>
<p t="238240" d="3800">You see these Yale students complaining about their oppression.</p>
<p t="242040" d="2360">It just leaves me aghast.</p>
<p t="244400" d="2960">It&#39;s like, &quot;we&#39;re against the ruling class.&quot;</p>
<p t="247360" d="3460">No, no, no - you&#39;re baby ruling class members</p>
<p t="250820" d="800">You&#39;re young -</p>
<p t="251620" d="7160">(Laughter and Applause)</p>
<p t="259200" d="3400">The only reason you&#39;re not rich is because you&#39;re young. You know that&#39;s the best -</p>
<p t="262600" d="4680">Really, if you look at the 1% even, the dreaded 1%</p>
<p t="267280" d="3340">you know most of those people are old. Why ?</p>
<p t="270620" d="3500">Well, when you progress through life, if you&#39;re reasonably successful</p>
<p t="274120" d="3920">you trade in your promising youth for your wealthy old age.</p>
<p t="278040" d="1760">But you&#39;re still bloody old.</p>
<p t="279800" d="1460">Would you trade it?</p>
<p t="281640" d="1720">Would you trade your youth for that?</p>
<p t="283760" d="3700">If you factor age out of the economic equation, things look a lot different.</p>
<p t="287460" d="2060">Well, of course older people have more money;</p>
<p t="289520" d="4160">If they have any sense they&#39;ve been collecting it for their whole life. Is that somehow unfair?</p>
<p t="294060" d="3700">It&#39;s not unfair, unless you want to be poverty stricken when you&#39;re 70.</p>
<p t="297760" d="3960">And you don&#39;t want to be poverty stricken when you&#39;re 70.</p>
<p t="302100" d="680">So,</p>
<p t="303520" d="2580">I just don&#39;t understand what&#39;s happened to the universities.</p>
<p t="306100" d="3480">I can&#39;t believe that you&#39;re not told when you come, the first day,</p>
<p t="309580" d="3380">&quot;Look, man, you&#39;re here on a heroic mission.&quot;</p>
<p t="313120" d="4600">&quot;You&#39;re going to take your capacity to articulate yourself to levels that are undreamed of.&quot;</p>
<p t="317800" d="4120">&quot;You&#39;re going to come out of here unstoppable. You&#39;re going to be able to do anything you want.&quot;</p>
<p t="322320" d="1660">It&#39;s like, that&#39;s what you&#39;re here for.</p>
<p t="324100" d="1480">Instead, you&#39;re taught that,</p>
<p t="325680" d="4400">&quot;Well, you know, the world&#39;s a pretty oppressive place and you&#39;re probably the bottom of the victim pile,</p>
<p t="330080" d="5800">and there&#39;s virtually nothing you can do about it except &#39;deconstruct the patriarchy&#39; &quot;</p>
<p t="336040" d="7000">and it&#39;s so weak-kneed and so pathetic that universities should be embarrassed that that&#39;s what they&#39;re peddling to students.</p>
<p t="343300" d="1500">I&#39;m embarrassed by it.</p>
<p t="345040" d="4880">You know, I&#39;ve gone on public record telling parents, &quot;bloody well send your boys to trade school</p>
<p t="349920" d="2360">because at least they&#39;ll learn something useful.&quot;</p>
<p t="352280" d="2580">And that&#39;s a terrible thing for someone like me to say, because</p>
<p t="355000" d="9340">I do believe that being articulated and educated in the highest possible manner...there&#39;s nothing that&#39;s better for you and for society.</p>
<p t="364560" d="2860">Why have the universities forgotten this?!</p>
<p t="367620" d="2900">Well, that&#39;s post-modern neo-Marxism for you, you know.</p>
<p t="370520" d="5620">Then the philosophy of intense resentment and oppression and group identity and...</p>
<p t="376140" d="3220">God, it&#39;s just...pathetic.</p>
