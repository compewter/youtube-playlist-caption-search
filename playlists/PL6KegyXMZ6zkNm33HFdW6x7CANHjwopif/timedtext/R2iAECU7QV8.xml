<p t="6560" d="5540">The Bible is a series of books written edited and assembled over thousands of years</p>
<p t="12900" d="3420">It contains the most influential stories of mankind</p>
<p t="17120" d="7200">Knowledge of these stories is essential to a deep understanding of western Culture, which is in turn vital to proper psychological health</p>
<p t="24760" d="3820">(as human beings are cultural animals ) and societal stability.</p>
<p t="29120" d="4900">These stories are neither history, as we commonly conceived it, nor empirical science.</p>
<p t="34540" d="4240">Instead they are investigations into the structure of Being itself</p>
<p t="38800" d="2640">and calls to action within that Being.</p>
<p t="41480" d="2920">They have deep psychological significance</p>
<p t="45040" d="4740">Hi, everyone. I just wanted to make a quick video to</p>
<p t="49880" d="3520">remind everyone or let everybody who&#39;s watching know that I&#39;m</p>
<p t="53660" d="3440">Starting my series on the stories of the Bible.</p>
<p t="57280" d="7340">The psychological significance of the stories on the Bible, on Tuesday May 16th, at the Isabel Bader Theatre in</p>
<p t="64940" d="5620">Downtown Toronto, I&#39;ll put the address and everything at the bottom of the video in the description</p>
<p t="70820" d="3480">I want to delve into the biblical stories from a psychological perspective</p>
<p t="74300" d="5140">And I wanted to do it for a long time and have done it in part in my maps of meaning series</p>
<p t="79440" d="3400">But the biblical stories are</p>
<p t="83000" d="4120">What, they&#39;re canonical in relationship to the rest of our culture.</p>
<p t="87120" d="3880">it&#39;s very difficult to understand western civilization itself unless,</p>
<p t="91000" d="2440">you&#39;re grounded in the biblical stories.</p>
<p t="93820" d="3580">They are like a precondition for knowledge of the humanities</p>
<p t="97400" d="4500">and a knowledge of history for that matter and so I want to improve my</p>
<p t="101960" d="4300">understanding of them, and share what I&#39;m able to figure out with everybody that I can, and so</p>
<p t="106420" d="3680">I wanted to just make a quick video to let everyone know that</p>
<p t="110100" d="4420">I&#39;m going to run a 12-week series, about two hours lecture per week</p>
<p t="114740" d="3260">Starting May 16th and running till approximately mid-august.</p>
<p t="118000" d="3560">pretty much every week except a couple where I couldn&#39;t get the theater.</p>
<p t="121620" d="6700">It&#39;s pretty nice theater so that would be good. I&#39;d also like to let everybody know that the videos will be taped</p>
<p t="128960" d="6559">Thanks to my patreon subscribers, and put on YouTube probably within a week or two after I initially show them</p>
<p t="135519" d="2370">As soon as we can get them edited and all of that, so</p>
<p t="138440" d="2540">Anyways - there&#39;s still season tickets left</p>
<p t="141680" d="6680">That&#39;s the tickets that will allow you entrance to all of the lectures, and there are individual tickets left for each lecture as well</p>
<p t="148360" d="3140">And you can get those at JordanBPeterson.com</p>
<p t="151700" d="5980">but as I said I&#39;ll put all the instructions and the details in the description of the video below, so</p>
<p t="158540" d="3200">tune in on YouTube if you&#39;re inclined to and if you&#39;re in Toronto</p>
<p t="161740" d="3689">And you&#39;d like to see them live then come down and see them live it should be really interesting</p>
<p t="165440" d="6400">I hope that&#39;s the plan anyways, so, thanks a lot and hopefully we&#39;ll see you there otherwise</p>
<p t="172420" d="5760">Well, you&#39;ll see them on YouTube, and that&#39;s good, too. Thanks a lot bye-bye</p>
