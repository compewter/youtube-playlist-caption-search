<p t="32850" d="5411">Nietzsche talking about the European state
of mind at the end of the 19th century, so</p>
<p t="38261" d="3068">Nietzsche says: well, we’re in this terrible
situation, right?</p>
<p t="41329" d="3201">God is dead, we’ve killed him, what does
that mean?</p>
<p t="44530" d="5610">Well, we’ve taken our evolved metaphysics
which structures our moral viewpoint and undermined</p>
<p t="50140" d="4730">it by rational criticism – peculiar move
philosophically because it was never established</p>
<p t="54870" d="1490">on rational grounds anyways.</p>
<p t="56360" d="4789">We’ve undermined it rationally and replaced
it with, well, nothing, nothing.</p>
<p t="61149" d="2271">What’s the consequence of that?</p>
<p t="63420" d="2290">Well, he outlines that here.</p>
<p t="65710" d="5640">“Of what is great, one must either be silent
or speak with greatness.”</p>
<p t="71350" d="4650">And you can think about this as a prophesy
on the events of World War I and World War</p>
<p t="76000" d="6569">II and the Gulag archipelago and the 60 million
people dead in the Soviet Union and the whole</p>
<p t="82569" d="5541">unfolding of 20th century history and the
great ideological battles that characterized</p>
<p t="88110" d="1000">that unfolding.</p>
<p t="89110" d="2880">So this is something Nietzsche sees coming
and knows why.</p>
<p t="91990" d="2700">He says:
“of what is great, one must either be silent</p>
<p t="94690" d="1660">or speak with greatness.</p>
<p t="96350" d="1839">With greatness.</p>
<p t="98189" d="2841">That means cynically and with innocence.</p>
<p t="101030" d="4479">What I relate of the history of the next two
centuries, I describe what is coming, what</p>
<p t="105509" d="2231">can no longer come differently.</p>
<p t="107740" d="3839">The advent of nihilism, right, the belief
in nothing.</p>
<p t="111579" d="4220">Our whole European culture is moving for some
time now with a tortured tension that’s</p>
<p t="115799" d="6511">growing from decade to decade as towards a
catastrophe, restlessly, violently, headlong</p>
<p t="122310" d="3640">like a river that wants to reach the end that
no longer reflects.</p>
<p t="125950" d="2640">It’s afraid to reflect.</p>
<p t="128590" d="5070">He that speaks here has conversely done nothing
so far but to reflect as a philosopher and</p>
<p t="133660" d="6229">solitary by instinct who has found his advantage
in standing aside outside.</p>
<p t="139889" d="2551">“
Why does the advent of nihilism become necessary?</p>
<p t="142440" d="6200">Well, because the values we’ve had hitherto
thus draw their final consequence because</p>
<p t="148640" d="5260">nihilism represents the ultimate logical conclusion
of our great values and ideals because we</p>
<p t="153900" d="6020">must experience nihilism before we can find
out what value these values really have.</p>
<p t="159920" d="3969">We require at some time new values.</p>
<p t="163889" d="5081">Nihilism stands at the door whence comes this
uncanniest of all guests.</p>
<p t="168970" d="3229">Nihilism, right?</p>
<p t="172199" d="3951">Your beliefs are undermined once, what’s
the consequence of that?</p>
<p t="176150" d="3200">Well, one consequence is the belief is undermined.</p>
<p t="179350" d="6220">The other consequence is more metaphysical,
which is: fooled once, you no longer have</p>
<p t="185570" d="1000">the belief.</p>
<p t="186570" d="2629">But maybe it’s even worse than that because
human beings can generalize.</p>
<p t="189199" d="4411">Fooled once, you never have any, you no longer
have any belief in beliefs,</p>
<p t="193610" d="3891">which means you say something like this: I
don’t care what you think, doesn’t matter</p>
<p t="197501" d="5039">what you think, the world is such a terrible
place that no interpretation whatsoever can</p>
<p t="202540" d="1460">possibly suffice.</p>
<p t="204000" d="1510">That’s nihilism.</p>
<p t="205510" d="3370">No meaning system whatsoever can possibly
suffice.</p>
<p t="208880" d="1889">Well, what’s the flaw?</p>
<p t="210769" d="5431">Well, the flaw is: well of course no system
of coherent belief can suffice because most</p>
<p t="216200" d="1740">of the world’s transcendent.</p>
<p t="217940" d="4319">You can’t encapsulate everything that is,
in your sphere of belief</p>
<p t="222259" d="4031">and what you might say then is that if you
ever believe that what you believe is what</p>
<p t="226290" d="5060">should support you, the facts you know say,
or the interpretation you place on the world,</p>
<p t="231350" d="2470">then your faith is badly misplaced.</p>
<p t="233820" d="3680">You don&#39;t believe in what you believe, you
believe in something that’s deeper than</p>
<p t="237500" d="3600">that
And so then you see what’s wrong with Tolstoy,</p>
<p t="241100" d="10000">right, and Tolstoy’s story and Tolstoy says,
accounting for his collapse in the stability</p>
<p t="251100" d="4090">of Christian belief,
he said: this all happened, this collapse</p>
<p t="255190" d="2819">of my belief, when I was not yet 50 years
old.</p>
<p t="258009" d="2380">I should have been considered a completely
happy man.</p>
<p t="260389" d="5331">I had a good, loving, beloved wife, fine children
and a large estate growing and expanding without</p>
<p t="265720" d="1620">any effort on my part.</p>
<p t="267340" d="4730">I was respected by friends and acquaintances,
praised by strangers and could claim a certain</p>
<p t="272070" d="1150">renown.</p>
<p t="273220" d="2850">I was not physically nor mentally unhealthy.</p>
<p t="276070" d="3850">On the contrary, I enjoyed a physical and
mental vigour I had rarely encountered among</p>
<p t="279920" d="1210">others my age.</p>
<p t="281130" d="3550">I could keep up with the peasants working
in the fields and work eight and ten hours</p>
<p t="284680" d="3910">at a stretch without suffering any after-effects
from the strain.</p>
<p t="288590" d="4530">And in such a state of affairs, I came to
a point where I could not live and even though</p>
<p t="293120" d="5480">I feared death, I had to employ ruses against
myself to keep from committing suicide.</p>
<p t="298600" d="5310">It was as though I had lived a little, wandered
a little until I came to a precipice and I</p>
<p t="303910" d="2960">clearly saw that there was nothing ahead except
ruin.</p>
<p t="306870" d="4250">And there was no stopping or turning back,
no closing my eyes so that I would not see</p>
<p t="311120" d="4170">that there was nothing ahead except the deception
of life and of happiness and of the reality</p>
<p t="315290" d="3020">of suffering and death, of complete annihilation.</p>
<p t="318310" d="2290">I grew sick of life.</p>
<p t="320600" d="3770">Some irresistible force was leading me to
somehow get rid of it.</p>
<p t="324370" d="4470">this thought was such a temptation that I
had to use cunning against myself in order</p>
<p t="328840" d="1570">not to go through with it.</p>
<p t="330410" d="5200">And there I was, a fortunate man carrying
a rope from my room where I was alone every</p>
<p t="335610" d="4320">night as I undressed so that I would not hang
myself from the beam between the closets.</p>
<p t="339930" d="3860">And I quit going hunting with a gun so that
I would not be too easily tempted to rid myself</p>
<p t="343790" d="1000">of life.</p>
<p t="344790" d="3870">I myself did not know what I wanted, was afraid
of life.</p>
<p t="348660" d="3590">I struggled to get rid of it yet I hoped for
something from it.</p>
<p t="352250" d="1460">My position was terrible.</p>
<p t="353710" d="4700">I knew that I could find nothing in the way
of rational knowledge except a denial of life</p>
<p t="358410" d="3490">and in faith I could find nothing except a
denial of reason.</p>
<p t="361900" d="4930">And for me this was even more impossible than
a denial of life.</p>
<p t="366830" d="4260">according to rational knowledge, it followed
that life is evil and people know it.</p>
<p t="371090" d="6500">I described my spiritual condition to myself
in this way: my life is some kind of stupid</p>
<p t="377590" d="3500">and evil practical joke that someone is playing
on me.</p>
<p t="381090" d="3270">In spite of the fact that I did not acknowledge
the existence of any someone who might have</p>
<p t="384360" d="5240">created me, the notion that someone brought
me into the world as a stupid and evil joke</p>
<p t="389600" d="4490">seemed to be the most natural way to describe
my condition.</p>
<p t="394090" d="1800">I could not be deceived.</p>
<p t="395890" d="5530">All is vanity, happy is he who’s never been
born, death is better than life, we must rid</p>
<p t="401420" d="2100">ourselves of life.</p>
<p t="403520" d="3510">Having realized all the stupidity of the joke
that is being played on us, and seeing that</p>
<p t="407030" d="3280">the blessings of the dead are greater than
those of the living and that it’s better</p>
<p t="410310" d="4780">not to exist, the strong act and put an end
to this stupid joke and they use any means</p>
<p t="415090" d="6620">of doing it – a rope around the neck, water,
a knife in the heart or a train.</p>
<p t="421710" d="3910">Now the interesting thing about this, I think,
is first of all, a Russian wrote it; and second</p>
<p t="425620" d="2280">of all, it was written in the late 1900s.</p>
<p t="427900" d="4250">And even more particularly is that you note
that when the strong act, using a rope around</p>
<p t="432150" d="5120">the neck, water, a knife in the heart and
a train, well, Tolstoy’s talking about suicide.</p>
<p t="437270" d="4290">There’s no necessary reason to presume that
this should only be violence engendered against</p>
<p t="441560" d="1080">the self, right?</p>
<p t="442640" d="6550">If life is a stupid and evil joke, then what’s
stopping you from benevolently putting an</p>
<p t="449190" d="3330">end to the suffering of others, right?</p>
<p t="452520" d="5040">Benevolently in theory at least.</p>
<p t="457560" d="5900">Well, you know that’s one perspective, right,
but then there’s always the perspective</p>
<p t="463460" d="3850">of the lady who went to see the psychiatrist
in T.S.</p>
<p t="467310" d="5400">Eliot’s poem, which is: well, if when your
eyes are open life appears as nothing but</p>
<p t="472710" d="4520">suffering and pain to you, it could be that
that is how life is.</p>
<p t="477230" d="3320">But it could also be that there’s something
wrong with the way that you’re looking at</p>
<p t="480550" d="1000">the world.</p>
<p t="481550" d="3850">And in some ways, that’s a much more humble
perspective, right, because the alternative</p>
<p t="485400" d="3720">is: well, I know what’s going on and I just
look out there and there’s the world and</p>
<p t="489120" d="4250">I’ve pretty much got it, like I know what
it means and what it means is pointless suffering</p>
<p t="493370" d="4109">and pain and that’s my model and I don&#39;t
see any reason to question it.</p>
<p t="497479" d="4391">But then the alternative is: well, wait a
second, there’s always the possibility that</p>
<p t="501870" d="4940">I don’t know absolutely everything and this
final and horrible judgment that I’m placing</p>
<p t="506810" d="6970">on the conditions of existence could conceivably
be misplaced, given the sort of presumptuousness</p>
<p t="513780" d="1210">of the claim,
right?</p>
<p t="514990" d="6830">I’m in a position to render final judgment
on the moral value of existence as such.</p>
<p t="521820" d="6420">It seems to me reasonable to presume that
that’s not the kind of statement that you</p>
<p t="528240" d="5440">should easily make
And I remember when George Bush launched his</p>
<p t="533680" d="5460">most recent war, the initial terminology,
I think this was for the Afghanistan battle,</p>
<p t="539140" d="2570">was: Operation Infinite Justice.</p>
<p t="541710" d="6189">But he retracted that phrase after a number
of religious leaders objected to its kind</p>
<p t="547899" d="3031">of presumptuousness –
which I thought was quite reasonable because</p>
<p t="550930" d="5551">infinite justice is something that most people
should probably not hope for, right, because</p>
<p t="556481" d="2298">you never know precisely what infinite justice
means</p>
<p t="558779" d="4800">because it might just mean that every bloody
mistake you’ve ever made, you’re going</p>
<p t="563579" d="1021">to pay for.</p>
<p t="564600" d="5820">And I suppose that would be just as applicable
to George W. Bush as it would to anybody else</p>
<p t="570420" d="5090">And then Milton again describes the development
of this adversarial spirit.</p>
<p t="575510" d="3809">He says: first, pride, pride and worse, ambition,
threw me down.</p>
<p t="579319" d="2591">That’s Satan’s lament when he’s in hell.</p>
<p t="581910" d="2589">And Milton’s description of hell is extremely
interesting.</p>
<p t="584499" d="4481">He said: the reason that hell is characterized
by its structure is not so much because of</p>
<p t="588980" d="4549">its nature precisely, it’s because of its
distance from the good.</p>
<p t="593529" d="6071">So the farther you are away, say, from what
constitutes the good, the more suffering is</p>
<p t="599600" d="1649">endemic to that state.</p>
<p t="601249" d="3320">So it’s the distance away from something
that constitutes the suffering.</p>
<p t="604569" d="4500">And then Milton says: it’s very interesting
to do an analysis of Satan’s character and</p>
<p t="609069" d="4820">the notion of hell per se because how in the
world can you reconcile the idea of a good</p>
<p t="613889" d="2760">God with the notion of this continual suffering?</p>
<p t="616649" d="4601">Milton says: well, Satan can step out of hell
in one moment, all he has to do is admit that</p>
<p t="621250" d="1110">he was wrong.</p>
<p t="622360" d="6409">And that’s the one thing that he will not
do under any circumstances whatsoever</p>
<p t="628769" d="2961">So then we put one more twist on the story
and we say something like this:</p>
<p t="631730" d="4520">OK, we already know that part of the reason
that people have belief systems is so that</p>
<p t="636250" d="2370">they can structure their interactions with
the world.</p>
<p t="638620" d="2439">It’s a tool box, say.</p>
<p t="641059" d="3911">We’re playing a game, we share the rules,
that’s fine, we can cooperate with one another.</p>
<p t="644970" d="4369">It could be other than it is but it’s the
way it is and it works for us, that’s fine.</p>
<p t="649339" d="4030">There’s nothing absolute about it except
that a structure like that is necessary.</p>
<p t="653369" d="5590">Now whenever there’s a threat to that shared
view of the world, well then we’re afraid</p>
<p t="658959" d="4540">and for good reason and it’s not surprising
under those circumstances that we fight to</p>
<p t="663499" d="2700">defend what we’ve made ours.</p>
<p t="666199" d="6570">But then you say, say you adopt this perspective,
right, and it’s this vengeful desire to</p>
<p t="672769" d="6051">destroy that extends beyond other individuals
and beyond society even to the structure of</p>
<p t="678820" d="1199">experience as such.</p>
<p t="680019" d="4221">And then you think: well, what’s the best
mask for that and how do these two processes</p>
<p t="684240" d="1310">sort of interact?</p>
<p t="685550" d="7829">And you think: well, the most efficient way
to do terrible things is to mask them with</p>
<p t="693379" d="4150">the highest order of morality and that’s
precisely what the totalitarian does.</p>
<p t="697529" d="2110">So that way, he gets to have his cake and
eat it too.</p>
<p t="699639" d="5040">He’s perfectly well protected from apprehension
of the world because his belief system is</p>
<p t="704679" d="5481">complete, plus his underground motivations,
which is this constant desire for revenge,</p>
<p t="710160" d="5529">can find their expression within the totalitarian
structure and remain invisible even to himself.</p>
<p t="715689" d="5971">So he can say to himself: well, the reason
I threw all those farmers out of their house</p>
<p t="721660" d="5679">in 1920 and stole their soup and their food
and their grandmother’s blankets and everything</p>
<p t="727339" d="4690">they’d worked to own was because I was building
a socialist paradise, right?</p>
<p t="732029" d="3581">And it was a good thing for me to go into
that house and not a bad thing.</p>
<p t="735610" d="3970">And as long as he believes that, or acts as
if he believes that, then he can look in the</p>
<p t="739580" d="4730">mirror without screaming and there’s no
recognition whatsoever of precisely the sort</p>
<p t="744310" d="3839">of game that he’s involved in, so he has
it both ways, right?</p>
<p t="748149" d="4571">He can do everything terrible that he always
dreams of doing and consider himself not only</p>
<p t="752720" d="6729">good but good even at a higher level than
the people that he was actually afflicting.</p>
<p t="759449" d="8501">And of course, that’s just standard description
of what happened in the Soviet Union.</p>
<p t="767950" d="5410">Nietzsche says, I love this, his definition
of morality, it’s the most cynical thing</p>
<p t="773360" d="7389">Nietzsche ever said, I think: “the idiosyncrasy
of decadence with the ulterior motive of revenging</p>
<p t="780749" d="2580">oneself against life successfully.</p>
<p t="783329" d="3010">I attach value to this definition.”</p>
<p t="786339" d="2180">He said: well, why be an ideologue?</p>
<p t="788519" d="2560">Well, it’s a good way to simplify the world,
right?</p>
<p t="791079" d="4091">It’s a procrustean bed, you just chop off
everything that doesn’t fit, then you don’t</p>
<p t="795170" d="1000">have to think, right?</p>
<p t="796170" d="3829">So that’s good because thinking is difficult
and it’s troublesome and it takes courage</p>
<p t="799999" d="3921">and so forth to transform chaos into order
is no trivial matter.</p>
<p t="803920" d="3909">And if it’s all ordered for you, well then
there’s really nothing left for you to do.</p>
<p t="807829" d="1880">But then Nietzsche goes even below that.</p>
<p t="809709" d="2100">He says: yeah, well there’s more to the
story than that, isn’t there?</p>
<p t="811809" d="5650">It’s like once you got this little procrustean
bed all arranged for your enemies, then you</p>
<p t="817459" d="7100">can allow your most base, vengeful instincts
full flow by just continually chopping people</p>
<p t="824559" d="1491">so they fit.</p>
<p t="826050" d="6810">And you do it, all the while saying: well,
it’s obviously the best thing that could</p>
<p t="832860" d="6629">possibly be done.</p>
<p t="839489" d="7361">And so then you look at Stalin, say, because
not everybody who’s adopted a vengeful tack</p>
<p t="846850" d="5109">on existence is sort of like the archetype
of vengefulness or adversarial spirit.</p>
<p t="851959" d="4320">But you get now and then the people like Stalin,
who are good counter-examples, say, to the</p>
<p t="856279" d="1090">people like Gandhi.</p>
<p t="857369" d="3921">And so Stalin’s very instructive and so
we could start by looking at what he did in</p>
<p t="861290" d="1299">the Ukraine.</p>
<p t="862589" d="5261">So at the end of 1929, the Kremlin decreed
that millions of peasants from individually</p>
<p t="867850" d="4750">owned farms would be forced into agricultural
collectives or kolkhozes seen in the eyes</p>
<p t="872600" d="4960">of the politburo as pliant providers of Soviet
agricultural needs.</p>
<p t="877560" d="5160">In defiance of the facts, Soviet ideologists
hammered out an appropriate Marxist terminology</p>
<p t="882720" d="1859">to explain what was going on.</p>
<p t="884579" d="6421">Throughout grain-producing areas, it was said:
resistance to this scientific scheme was being</p>
<p t="891000" d="3119">organized by so-called rich peasants or Gulaks.</p>
<p t="894119" d="5151">With his customary brutality, therefore, Stalin
decreed the liquidation of the kulaks as a</p>
<p t="899270" d="3289">class
Well, Stalin liked this idea of like group</p>
<p t="902559" d="2280">guilt, that was a major theme for Stalin.</p>
<p t="904839" d="3230">That meant I really didn’t have to pay attention
to you as an individual.</p>
<p t="908069" d="5791">I could just decide if you were a doctor or
engineer or a kulak or a German or whatever</p>
<p t="913860" d="5009">ethnic, racial or educational division happened
to characterize a particular target at the</p>
<p t="918869" d="1000">time.</p>
<p t="919869" d="2551">And it didn’t matter if you were guilty
as an individual.</p>
<p t="922420" d="1539">That whole notion never even obtained.</p>
<p t="923959" d="3761">It was class guilt that mattered and if you
were in one of those classes, well we’re</p>
<p t="927720" d="1000">better without you.</p>
<p t="928720" d="2219">And of course, the nature of the class just
changed constantly.</p>
<p t="930939" d="5161">But it was a perfectly logical thing to think
if you believed in like historical determinism.</p>
<p t="936100" d="3590">If your parents were rich bourgeois, what
was the probability that you’re going to</p>
<p t="939690" d="2319">be a useful part of the workers’ collective?</p>
<p t="942009" d="3791">It would be easier just to get rid of you
ahead of time so you didn’t cause too much</p>
<p t="945800" d="1159">trouble.</p>
<p t="946959" d="3901">So then you think about these kulaks, rich
peasants, well who were these people?</p>
<p t="950860" d="2079">Like when we get down to the individual level?</p>
<p t="952939" d="6370">So you go in a village, the village was full
of serfs, like not 40 years before, so these</p>
<p t="959309" d="2501">are people just struggling out of the feudal
society,</p>
<p t="961810" d="1000">right?</p>
<p t="962810" d="3370">And you got some people in there who’ve
managed to be successful enough as farmers,</p>
<p t="966180" d="3969">which is no easy thing, to like have a house
and maybe hire one person.</p>
<p t="970149" d="6051">And you know maybe have a little extra food
in the larder and a few kind of material possessions.</p>
<p t="976200" d="3549">So these are successful people and so you
could say: well, they’re the ones that actually</p>
<p t="979749" d="1140">knew how to farm.</p>
<p t="980889" d="1000">That’s one theory.</p>
<p t="981889" d="3031">Or you could say: the reason they had all
this stuff was because they stole it from</p>
<p t="984920" d="1079">all the other people, right?</p>
<p t="985999" d="5940">And then you think: OK, so I march into town,
I’m a Soviet revolutionary and I say: hey,</p>
<p t="991939" d="4000">guys, you know those rich people, they stole
everything they have from you.</p>
<p t="995939" d="3070">And then you think: OK, which of you guys
is going to listen to that?</p>
<p t="999009" d="4050">Well, it’s not going to be the sort of struggling
people just underneath them, who are really</p>
<p t="1003059" d="2590">trying to get ahead, right, because that’s
where they’re hoping to get.</p>
<p t="1005649" d="5360">It’s going to be the resentful and revengeful
few who think: well, the world’s fundamentally</p>
<p t="1011009" d="3560">unfair and it’s obvious that those sons
of bitches got what they want from stealing</p>
<p t="1014569" d="4520">it form me and here it turns out that if I
just go down the street and steal it back,</p>
<p t="1019089" d="6661">well, not only am I allowed to do that but,
according to this new emergent ideology, man,</p>
<p t="1025750" d="3010">that’s the best thing I could possibly do.</p>
<p t="1028760" d="4910">So then multiply that story by several million
participants and you have like the first five</p>
<p t="1033670" d="1810">years of the Soviet empire.</p>
<p t="1035480" d="1910">And so what do we have there?</p>
<p t="1037390" d="3600">The result was a catastrophic onslaught on
millions of peasant households.</p>
<p t="1040990" d="7010">At first, party activists and local officials,
read bullies, right, brutalized peasants,</p>
<p t="1048000" d="2510">forcing them to surrender their homesteads
and their possessions.</p>
<p t="1050510" d="4310">Deportations, arrests and killings soon followed
as terror generalized.</p>
<p t="1054820" d="5160">The violence mounted to full-scale rebellion
in various places, with regular troops engaged</p>
<p t="1059980" d="1000">for months.</p>
<p t="1060980" d="4559">For example, suppressing peasant uprisings.</p>
<p t="1065539" d="4051">Resistance took various forms, usually reflecting
the hopeless, desperate anguish of a doomed</p>
<p t="1069590" d="1000">population.</p>
<p t="1070590" d="4260">In the Ukraine, there were even women’s
rebellions, spontaneous uprisings of peasant</p>
<p t="1074850" d="5360">women who attacked the local Kolkhozes to
demand the return of confiscated farm products.</p>
<p t="1080210" d="6620">With a colossal impact on the Soviet economy,
peasants slaughtered their animals by the</p>
<p t="1086830" d="2930">millions rather than see them seized.</p>
<p t="1089760" d="2690">For two years, the fighting raged.</p>
<p t="1092450" d="4740">As the dreadful process of de-kulakization
continued, Stalin ordered a further assault</p>
<p t="1097190" d="2020">on the recalcitrant peasantry.</p>
<p t="1099210" d="3180">What Conquest calls the terror-famine of 1932.</p>
<p t="1102390" d="7519">Moscow, writes Conquest, it’s from a book
called The Harvest of Sorrow, knowingly decreed</p>
<p t="1109909" d="4980">grain procurements from the Ukraine and elsewhere
exceeding by far what the local population</p>
<p t="1114889" d="4611">could produce, right, which meant that everyone
who lived there was forced and ordered to</p>
<p t="1119500" d="3309">deliver more grain than they had ever grown.</p>
<p t="1122809" d="4250">Communist brigades roamed the countryside
forcing agriculturalists to disgorge the little</p>
<p t="1127059" d="3970">they had been able to produce under conditions
of severe dislocation.</p>
<p t="1131029" d="8981">Grain sat unused in state reserves while the
local population starved.</p>
<p t="1140010" d="8710">This is from Wisdom, apocryphal Biblical writings:
for the reasoned unsoundly saying to themselves:</p>
<p t="1148720" d="5530">short and sorrowful is our life and there
is no remedy when a man comes to his end and</p>
<p t="1154250" d="2910">no one has been known to return from Hades.</p>
<p t="1157160" d="4609">Because we were born by mere chance and hereafter
we shall be as though we had never been because</p>
<p t="1161769" d="5290">the breath in our nostrils is smoke and reason
a spark kindled by the beating of our hearts.</p>
<p t="1167059" d="3480">When it is extinguished, the body will turn
to ashes and the spirit will dissolve like</p>
<p t="1170539" d="1390">empty air.</p>
<p t="1171929" d="4581">Our name will be forgotten in time and no
one will remember our works.</p>
<p t="1176510" d="3899">Our life will pass away like the traces of
a cloud and be scattered like mist that is</p>
<p t="1180409" d="3801">chased by the rays of the sun and overcome
by its heat.</p>
<p t="1184210" d="4500">For our allotted time is the passing of a
shadow and there’s no return from our death</p>
<p t="1188710" d="2900">because it is sealed up and no one turns back.</p>
<p t="1191610" d="5760">So a piece of writing thousands of years old
and so Nietzsche says at the end of the 1900s:</p>
<p t="1197370" d="2400">well, rationality undermines our faith in
religion.</p>
<p t="1199770" d="5460">But we have a piece of writing from more than
2,000 years ago that says: look, what is it</p>
<p t="1205230" d="1000">about being alive?</p>
<p t="1206230" d="2829">It’s short and there’s nothing to it,
right?</p>
<p t="1209059" d="3771">Our thoughts are biologically produced and
when we die there’s nothing left.</p>
<p t="1212830" d="4670">Well, that’s a very modern thought yet it
was expressed thousands of years ago so you</p>
<p t="1217500" d="5120">know, I think, merely from observing that
that the crisis of faith that characterizes</p>
<p t="1222620" d="5390">modern society is a reflection of the permanent
crisis of faith that characterizes human beings.</p>
<p t="1228010" d="2909">and you say: well, what’s happening with
the totalitarian?</p>
<p t="1230919" d="7751">Well, the totalitarian is afraid of the unknown,
for good reason, I mean and he’s very interested</p>
<p t="1238670" d="3369">in sustaining his own belief structure.</p>
<p t="1242039" d="5520">And the combination of those two things, it
can start off trivially is that the more you’re</p>
<p t="1247559" d="4590">convinced that you have to maintain the stability
of your current belief structure, the more</p>
<p t="1252149" d="4111">afraid you are of anything that’s unknown.</p>
<p t="1256260" d="4639">And the more afraid you are of anything that’s
unknown, the less likely you are to go out</p>
<p t="1260899" d="1000">and explore.</p>
<p t="1261899" d="2582">Then the less likely you are to go out and
explore, the weaker you get because you stop</p>
<p t="1264481" d="1558">gather information.</p>
<p t="1266039" d="3720">And then the weaker you get, the more necessary
it is that you have to have this frame of</p>
<p t="1269759" d="1841">reference and it has to remain intact.</p>
<p t="1271600" d="3449">And this sort of thing starts to cycle and
cycle.</p>
<p t="1275049" d="4311">So you undermine your own sense of your own
autonomy and ability and you make yourself</p>
<p t="1279360" d="4189">more and more a rigid tool of the propagandistic
system.</p>
<p t="1283549" d="4911">And you more and more adopt a sense of enmity
towards anything you don’t understand.</p>
<p t="1288460" d="4950">And that’s a spiral that goes rapidly down
hill, right, rapidly into a state that’s</p>
<p t="1293410" d="4989">characterized by complete internal chaos
And I think that’s a good definition of</p>
<p t="1298399" d="3750">what is meant in metaphysical language by
hell, right?</p>
<p t="1302149" d="1321">Hell is a bottomless pit.</p>
<p t="1303470" d="1000">Why?</p>
<p t="1304470" d="4530">Well, I don’t care how bad things are for
you or around you, there’s always some bloody</p>
<p t="1309000" d="1720">thing you could do to make it worse, right?</p>
<p t="1310720" d="3900">There’s always some suffering you can extend
to others, there’s always some bit of stubbornness</p>
<p t="1314620" d="4220">or rejection that you can pull off that will
make your already terrible situation worse,</p>
<p t="1318840" d="1000">right?</p>
<p t="1319840" d="2400">So there’s no bottom and that seems to me
to be right.</p>
<p t="1322240" d="5460">If you do just a cursory historical analysis,
no matter what terrible account you can come</p>
<p t="1327700" d="5020">across with regards to, say, concentration
camp brutality, in some other book there’s</p>
<p t="1332720" d="1250">some worse story.</p>
<p t="1333970" d="6030">Like limited only by the absolute ends of
the most brutal form of imagination, all a</p>
<p t="1340000" d="3159">consequence, I think, of this process, right?</p>
<p t="1343159" d="5130">And you can’t really say what causes it
because on the one hand, there’s cowardice</p>
<p t="1348289" d="1921">and lack of faith, right?</p>
<p t="1350210" d="4140">Anything I don’t understand – cowardice,
pride and lack of faith.</p>
<p t="1354350" d="4260">Anything I don’t understand doesn’t exist,
plus I’m not the person to confront it anyways,</p>
<p t="1358610" d="1000">right?</p>
<p t="1359610" d="1080">That’s the lack of faith.</p>
<p t="1360690" d="4869">Each of those things feeds into the other
and it’s very difficult to say where it</p>
<p t="1365559" d="1000">starts.</p>
<p t="1366559" d="7541">And the thing that’s kind of interesting
about these self-referential processes is</p>
<p t="1374100" d="4630">that they don’t have to start dramatically.</p>
<p t="1378730" d="5090">Like the loop can start very, very small and
it picks up speed very, very rapidly.</p>
<p t="1383820" d="4320">So you imagine you’re speaking into a tape
recorder and the speaker’s on.</p>
<p t="1388140" d="3930">You get too close to the speaker with the
microphone and you get some feedback.</p>
<p t="1392070" d="3001">And if you bring the microphone a little closer,
the feedback develops more and more intensely.</p>
<p t="1395071" d="1988">It can blow up the whole system.</p>
<p t="1397059" d="5681">It doesn’t have to start dramatically to
move forward very, very rapidly.</p>
<p t="1402740" d="4529">And what that means, at least in principle,
is that even small mistakes anywhere along</p>
<p t="1407269" d="5150">this circle can start the development of precisely
this kind of spiral.</p>
<p t="1412419" d="4071">And so you say: well, people, do people need
to be abused to become totalitarian?</p>
<p t="1416490" d="5840">Well, and the answer to that is no because
everyone’s been abused sufficiently by some</p>
<p t="1422330" d="4579">occurrences in their life to justify taking
a negative tack on the nature of experience.</p>
<p t="1426909" d="4311">You say: well, how cowardly do you have to
be in order to run away from things?</p>
<p t="1431220" d="5150">And you think: well, not that cowardly because
under most circumstances your life is characterized</p>
<p t="1436370" d="1880">by sins of omission, right?</p>
<p t="1438250" d="5790">It’s there are things you left undone
and like just exactly how rigid do you want</p>
<p t="1444040" d="1360">your belief systems to be?</p>
<p t="1445400" d="4700">And you say: well, I like them to be stable
because without that stability, then I’m</p>
<p t="1450100" d="1000">terrified.</p>
<p t="1451100" d="4279">And then you can say: well, fair enough but
that’s all a sign of a kind of existential</p>
<p t="1455379" d="1000">weakness.</p>
<p t="1456379" d="3871">And then if social circumstances come around
and give your life a good tweak, say like</p>
<p t="1460250" d="3860">they did with the Germans prior to World War
II, you just never know what side you’re</p>
<p t="1464110" d="1000">going to end up on.</p>
<p t="1465110" d="4460">And so all these little tiny mistakes you
know, mistakes that I think are marked by</p>
<p t="1469570" d="4150">your own conscience, are precisely that, leads
you down this terrible path.</p>
<p t="1473720" d="3280">And if you think: well, no, that can’t be
right – well, then you have to remember</p>
<p t="1477000" d="5879">that in these processes, say, of de-kulakization
and the immense wave of death that characterized</p>
<p t="1482879" d="3961">the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany, most people
were involved.</p>
<p t="1486840" d="6290">And if they weren’t involved in direct acts
of commission, they were absolutely involved</p>
<p t="1493130" d="2080">in direct acts of omission, right?</p>
<p t="1495210" d="3610">They knew but they didn’t say anything.</p>
<p t="1498820" d="5150">Well, classically sins of commission are regarded
as much more evil, say, than sins of omission.</p>
<p t="1503970" d="1949">But I actually think that’s backwards.</p>
<p t="1505919" d="5500">The sins of omission are worse because every
time you walk away, I mean what do you do?</p>
<p t="1511419" d="2510">You walk away from a Nazi, what are you walking
away from?</p>
<p t="1513929" d="2541">Well, we know what you’re walking away from,
right?</p>
<p t="1516470" d="9169">If you’re walking away from a domain that’s
likely to expand into something that’s completely</p>
<p t="1525639" d="5651">undifferentiable from hell, and it’s no
wonder you walk away from that, but the fact</p>
<p t="1531290" d="4969">that you walk away from it makes it much more
likely that it’s going to happen</p>
<p t="1536259" d="5061">So then I think, to end this, something like
this.</p>
<p t="1541320" d="4800">We look for economic reasons to explain great
terrible acts, right?</p>
<p t="1546120" d="4939">We look for social reasons, we look for political
reasons but we have Nietzsche’s observation,</p>
<p t="1551059" d="3950">which is something like this:
I don’t care whether or not your life’s</p>
<p t="1555009" d="2370">been characterized by suffering and deprivation.</p>
<p t="1557379" d="4800">The mere fact of suffering and deprivation
does not allow you to draw a particular conclusion.</p>
<p t="1562179" d="3980">You can’t say that there’s a causal path
between economic deprivation, say, and the</p>
<p t="1566159" d="4561">rise of a totalitarian state because any event
is susceptible to multiple interpretations.</p>
<p t="1570720" d="2230">Well, how do these states come about?</p>
<p t="1572950" d="5190">Well, I think: well, we look for political
and economic and social reasons because that’s</p>
<p t="1578140" d="1930">the easiest place top look, right?</p>
<p t="1580070" d="4920">If you ratchet up the level of description
to social forces that are beyond your control,</p>
<p t="1584990" d="3030">then you never have to worry about what it
is that you’re doing or not doing that’s</p>
<p t="1588020" d="1830">actually causing this sort of thing.</p>
<p t="1589850" d="4059">But I think if you look at the historical
record, especially if you look at it from</p>
<p t="1593909" d="5441">a mythological perspective, the story is basically
clear and it goes something like this:</p>
<p t="1599350" d="5630">Every time you make a mistake that you know
is a mistake and you don’t fix it, the world</p>
<p t="1604980" d="1880">moves more towards that.</p>
<p t="1606860" d="3710">And it might be trivial, maybe, but it might
not be.</p>
<p t="1610570" d="3349">So you look at Adolf Eichmann, for example,
and he’s a little bureaucrat who planned</p>
<p t="1613919" d="4850">the Final Solution and you find out he’s
just a little ratty guy, right?</p>
<p t="1618769" d="3731">You see him in a bar, you don’t even notice
him, he’s a negligible nobody.</p>
<p t="1622500" d="4299">But he’s the guy who planned the Final Solution.</p>
<p t="1626799" d="4860">He was a normal person, I mean maybe even
slightly less than normal, right?</p>
<p t="1631659" d="4421">He is no monster, he wasn’t the sort of
person you’d remark on if you saw him.</p>
<p t="1636080" d="6670">Precisely the opposite: invisible, quiet,
unassuming, presuming no doubt, at least until</p>
<p t="1642750" d="4989">he was arrested, that he was just doing what
he was told and that was just fine.</p>
