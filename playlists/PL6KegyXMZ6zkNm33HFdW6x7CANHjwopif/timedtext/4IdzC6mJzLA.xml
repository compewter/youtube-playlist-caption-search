<p t="939" d="2000">Hi everyone so</p>
<p t="3580" d="5720">I&#39;m making an announcement today, and I suppose you might regard it as an advertisement</p>
<p t="9300" d="5370">So I&#39;m warning you to begin with because I don&#39;t want you to waste your time if you&#39;re not</p>
<p t="14950" d="4700">interested in listening to a description of the newest thing that we&#39;ve created so we</p>
<p t="20199" d="6710">Just put up a website called understand myself calm, and it&#39;s a personality assessment for individuals</p>
<p t="26910" d="5010">And it&#39;s based on a personality model that was developed in my lab about</p>
<p t="32469" d="3470">Ten years ago by dr. Colin D. Young and</p>
<p t="37480" d="4579">Lean dr. Lena quilty dr. De young is now a professor at the University of, Minnesota</p>
<p t="42550" d="5900">And it was based on some ideas that I had been developing with another former student of mine dr.</p>
<p t="48489" d="7280">Daniel Higgins who&#39;s a partner with me and this enterprise along with my former graduate supervisor dr. Robert Peel from McGill University?</p>
<p t="56680" d="4099">It&#39;s based on the Big Five personality model which measures extraversion</p>
<p t="61750" d="4849">which is a positive emotion dimension and is associated with gregariousness and</p>
<p t="67090" d="3260">enthusiasm and assertiveness and sociability and that sort of thing and</p>
<p t="70780" d="4040">A trait called neuroticism which is basically negative emotionality</p>
<p t="75100" d="4129">Which is associated with a proclivity towards anxiety and emotional pain?</p>
<p t="80350" d="7940">Agreeableness which is compassion and politeness and so agreeable people are I would say broadly speaking rather maternal in their orientation</p>
<p t="88479" d="2569">They tend to care more for others than for themselves</p>
<p t="91320" d="5909">They&#39;re more cooperative than competitive whereas so-called disagreeable people are more competitive and more</p>
<p t="97869" d="6050">Brusque I would say and perhaps more straightforward and more able to stand up for themselves as well</p>
<p t="104979" d="4610">Conscientiousness is another one of the dimensions. That&#39;s orderliness and industriousness and</p>
<p t="110259" d="6560">the last dimension is opens to experience which is a combination of interest in ideas, which is often known as intellect and</p>
<p t="117850" d="3080">Interest in aesthetics and which is associated</p>
<p t="120939" d="7700">let&#39;s say with creativity and that&#39;s the dimension that&#39;s also most highly correlated with IQ we developed the big five aspect scale in an</p>
<p t="128640" d="5969">Attempt to take the big five so that&#39;s extraversion neuroticism agreeableness conch justice and openness to experience</p>
<p t="135310" d="2179">Which are the canonical dimensions of personality?</p>
<p t="137950" d="7309">We developed the big5 aspect scale in order to break down those big five traits each of them into their two most</p>
<p t="145780" d="3739">Statistically robust sub components and we call those aspects</p>
<p t="149519" d="5820">And that&#39;s actually become a pretty popular personality model the scientific paper which announced that</p>
<p t="156040" d="2179">statistical division has accrued about</p>
<p t="158769" d="6740">750 citations which is an awful lot of citations by the way for a scientific paper it makes it into a kind of classic</p>
<p t="166480" d="3139">Especially because it&#39;s only also only had ten years to accrue</p>
<p t="170260" d="5509">Citations and a citation is when some other scientist refers to the paper in one of their papers by the way</p>
<p t="176169" d="500">anyways</p>
<p t="176669" d="4380">I&#39;ve been working over the last couple of years to generate really detailed</p>
<p t="181359" d="5660">personality reports on each of the big five traits and the ten aspects at about seven different levels of</p>
<p t="187689" d="7880">Specificity ranging from extremely low to extremely high, and we think we&#39;ve produced what might be the most comprehensive and accurate</p>
<p t="196150" d="6679">Personality reports that are currently available you answer a hundred questions in order to complete the personality survey</p>
<p t="202959" d="5179">The questions themselves are actually public access or you could call them open source</p>
<p t="208720" d="5119">They were derived from Lew Goldberg&#39;s IP IP international personality item pool</p>
<p t="213879" d="3559">They&#39;re the consequence of many many decades of attempts to</p>
<p t="218139" d="3020">Define a set of phrases that most</p>
<p t="221889" d="4880">comprehensively and also most concisely captures the variation in human personality and</p>
<p t="227019" d="6020">So you can find those questions many places on the line, but the reports themselves and the comparison sample of approximately</p>
<p t="233769" d="1920">10,000 people are</p>
<p t="235689" d="7400">Proprietary and constitute the central element of value in in our offering essentially and what we&#39;re hoping is that people can use this</p>
<p t="243280" d="7639">personality test site to develop a much deeper understanding of themselves so that they know what they&#39;re like especially compared to others and</p>
<p t="251289" d="7369">That they can also compare themselves to anyone else for example who might have taken the test and see the thing about</p>
<p t="259090" d="4069">Personality is that the differences between people actually run quite deep</p>
<p t="263159" d="4060">There&#39;s a lot of individual variability, so there are people who are extreme extraverted</p>
<p t="267220" d="2000">They want to spend every moment of their time</p>
<p t="269300" d="4760">Socializing with other people and there are people who are very introverted, and they want to work alone</p>
<p t="274060" d="6269">And they find interactions with with large groups of people or even small groups sometimes quite tiring</p>
<p t="280330" d="5160">And they have to spend a lot of time recovering they tend to be much more quiet. They&#39;re not necessarily</p>
<p t="285490" d="2000">Shy because that shyness is more</p>
<p t="288169" d="7610">Consequence of variation on the second dimension neuroticism and so people are high in neuroticism I feel much more anxiety and emotional pain</p>
<p t="295970" d="4489">per unit of uncertainty and stress than people who are very low in neuroticism who are</p>
<p t="300680" d="3440">Often known as emotionally stable and who tend to be quite imperturbable</p>
<p t="305030" d="5660">Agreeable people as I mentioned before are warm and compassionate and and very much care for other people</p>
<p t="310690" d="6929">but are also likely to be taken advantage of and to feel a certain amount of resentment whereas disagreeable people are tough and straightforward and</p>
<p t="318080" d="5179">competitive and out for victory, but can also be somewhat self-centered and harsh and then</p>
<p t="323840" d="5839">Conscientious people are hardworking and dutiful conscientiousness is a really good predictor of long-term life success especially in</p>
<p t="330169" d="4429">Academic attainment where it&#39;s second only to IQ and also in managerial and administrative</p>
<p t="335030" d="3649">jobs that require attention to detail and a fair bit of</p>
<p t="339320" d="2539">Responsibility let&#39;s say and routine work</p>
<p t="342469" d="1311">Open this to experience</p>
<p t="343780" d="3750">That&#39;s the creativity dimension and some people are extremely high and openness to experience</p>
<p t="347750" d="5929">And they want to do nothing but discuss ideas and and spend their time in creative and artistic pursuits</p>
<p t="353680" d="4289">And other people are more conservative because low openness is associated with conservatism</p>
<p t="357969" d="5820">And they&#39;re not really interested in novel ideas, and they don&#39;t think abstractly that often</p>
<p t="363789" d="4320">And they&#39;re they&#39;re not out for new experiences or flights of fantasy or imaginative</p>
<p t="368389" d="2570">Exercises or any of that thing there are a lot more concrete and practical</p>
<p t="371270" d="6500">Now the reports that we&#39;ve prepared not only provide you with information about all of the aforementioned big five traits</p>
<p t="378319" d="7190">They also break each one down into its dual aspects. So there&#39;s actually 15 different sources of information</p>
<p t="386120" d="4549">that are contained in the reports and so for extraversion you get a</p>
<p t="391310" d="7849">Description of the degree to which you&#39;re assertive, which means forthcoming let&#39;s say in public and willing to put your opinions forward</p>
<p t="399830" d="6059">And enthusiasm which is a more pure marker of positive emotion and the capacity to look forward to and enjoy</p>
<p t="406800" d="1770">events and situations</p>
<p t="408570" d="6320">Spontaneously and with neuroticism you learn about the trait aspects</p>
<p t="415710" d="3859">withdrawal and volatility and withdrawal is the tendency to be</p>
<p t="420750" d="5869">Stymied or or stopped. Let&#39;s say by fear to be frozen in some sense like a prey animal and</p>
<p t="427140" d="1790">Volatility is an aspect</p>
<p t="428930" d="5759">That&#39;s associated with irritability and the tendency to be easily rubbed the wrong way</p>
<p t="434700" d="3739">Let&#39;s say and to react emotionally to that and then for agreeableness</p>
<p t="438440" d="4020">There&#39;s two aspects and one is compassion, which means pretty much what it says</p>
<p t="442460" d="5880">it&#39;s the ability to embody the feelings of others and to react in a caring manner to that and</p>
<p t="448800" d="2089">politeness which seems to be something like</p>
<p t="451350" d="2480">respect for authority and social conventions</p>
<p t="453830" d="4140">and so one of the things you see for example is that liberals are higher in compassion and</p>
<p t="458100" d="2360">Conservatives are higher in politeness even though. They&#39;re both</p>
<p t="461130" d="5450">Aspects of trait agreeableness conscientiousness breaks down into two aspects as well, which are quite interesting</p>
<p t="467220" d="4069">One of them is industriousness which is associated with diligent hard work</p>
<p t="471290" d="5130">and the ability to stay task focused without distraction and to work hard and</p>
<p t="477120" d="5209">orderliness which seems to be associated with disgust sensitivity and which is a pretty good predictor of</p>
<p t="482880" d="1320">conservative belief</p>
<p t="484200" d="6470">As it turns out that some elements of conservative belief are associated with higher than normal levels of or higher than average</p>
<p t="490670" d="4320">Let&#39;s say levels of disgust sensitivity and the final trait</p>
<p t="495630" d="5929">Division in two aspects is that of openness to experience and it can be divided into openness proper?</p>
<p t="501570" d="6589">Which is essentially a dimension of creativity and aesthetic sensitivity so preference for engagement?</p>
<p t="508560" d="3980">activities that are associated say with fiction or drama or art and</p>
<p t="513240" d="3080">intellect which is an index of interest in ideas and</p>
<p t="516690" d="5780">Abstraction and philosophical concepts and that sort of things so the report produces a very high resolution</p>
<p t="523979" d="2060">Representation of personality and there are very interesting</p>
<p t="526560" d="2090">Differences at the aspect level that are worth</p>
<p t="529140" d="5010">Concentrating on we try to develop a personality test that isn&#39;t designed to make you feel good yourself</p>
<p t="534150" d="6330">Although it might you know it depends on your personality but to give you the most accurate and straightforward description of who you are</p>
<p t="540640" d="8000">That&#39;s possible so that you can use the genuine information. That&#39;s provided in order to maybe organize your life also</p>
<p t="549160" d="1170">understand the difference between</p>
<p t="550330" d="6380">Yourself and other people because you know we often think that the reason that we don&#39;t share the same viewpoint is because we have differences</p>
<p t="556710" d="460">of opinion</p>
<p t="557170" d="2449">but it actually goes a lot deeper than that because</p>
<p t="560050" d="960">You&#39;re very</p>
<p t="561010" d="7250">Perceptions are dependent on the variability in your personality and so it isn&#39;t only that people differ in their opinions they differ very much in</p>
<p t="568260" d="4320">How they see the world how they actually perceive the world because your personality</p>
<p t="573010" d="5239">Constitutes a kind of template or filter through, which you organize your perceptions and so</p>
<p t="578250" d="2880">It&#39;s very important to understand that there is substantial</p>
<p t="581860" d="5180">Personality variability in the world and that you&#39;re often talking with people who see things differently</p>
<p t="587260" d="3979">Than you and a good example of that is the divide between</p>
<p t="591730" d="6409">let&#39;s say left-leaning people and right leading people because the left-leaning people tend to be very high and openness to experience and</p>
<p t="598600" d="6829">Relatively low in conscientiousness especially in the aspect of orderliness whereas the conservative types tend to be very high in</p>
<p t="605830" d="2000">conscientiousness especially orderliness and</p>
<p t="608290" d="3319">Relatively low and openness and so those are fundamentally different</p>
<p t="612130" d="4820">Orientations in the world and you could say that the more conservative types the more right-wing types</p>
<p t="617260" d="6530">Are much more concerned with the preservation of tradition and tend to believe that things that have been done the?</p>
<p t="623950" d="2720">Tried-and-true manner in the past are the most reliable</p>
<p t="627220" d="4489">Whereas the people who are on the Left who are more radical are more concerned with the fact that?</p>
<p t="631870" d="6170">The environment shifts radically and rapidly and unpredictably and so we have to be willing to shift with it and so</p>
<p t="638560" d="7010">Those are both valid viewpoints because every element of lived experience has an orderly element and a chaotic element</p>
<p t="645570" d="3750">Let&#39;s say and you have to be prepared for both and the purpose of</p>
<p t="649810" d="5059">straightforward political dialogue between people of different personality types is to help determine on an ongoing</p>
<p t="655150" d="5270">Basis how much we should be relying on tradition and how much we should be attempting to transform ourselves</p>
<p t="660460" d="4789">and there&#39;s no permanent solution to that problem because things stay the same and</p>
<p t="665760" d="5009">And they do that at different rates at different times so dialogue is unbelievably important</p>
<p t="670769" d="2250">Which by the way is why I&#39;m such an advocate</p>
<p t="673060" d="7639">Let&#39;s say for free speech because it&#39;s the mechanism that keeps people of different types speaking instead of fighting, so it&#39;s really important, so</p>
<p t="681220" d="3799">Anyways the website is called understand myself calm</p>
<p t="685019" d="5160">And you can go there and sign up for the personality test it&#39;ll be delivered to you pretty much immediately</p>
<p t="690370" d="4309">After you fill out the questions each question is posed as a phrase</p>
<p t="696220" d="2000">Take you about 15 minutes to</p>
<p t="698380" d="1290">complete the questions</p>
<p t="699670" d="3169">you can only do it once and the reason for that is is that the</p>
<p t="702910" d="4880">Norms that we compared you against so that would be the self reports of the 10,000 other people</p>
<p t="707920" d="4279">Against whom you&#39;re compared they were only allowed to do it once and so we have to maintain</p>
<p t="712540" d="5869">Stringent control over that to maintain the validity of the test, and I would say don&#39;t do it when you&#39;re hungry</p>
<p t="719019" d="1831">Don&#39;t do it when you&#39;re tired</p>
<p t="720850" d="3710">Don&#39;t do it when you&#39;re feeling down or in a bad mood about yourself or feeling</p>
<p t="724899" d="4820">Self-critical and don&#39;t do it when you&#39;re likely to be interrupted or distracted you want to take it seriously</p>
<p t="729720" d="6090">And you want to think about your answers now you&#39;re supposed to answer as you are typically not as you&#39;d like to be</p>
<p t="736240" d="3349">And you know you don&#39;t want to be either too hard on yourself, or too</p>
<p t="739589" d="4290">good to yourself you want to be as accurate as possible because then you&#39;ll benefit most from the</p>
<p t="744399" d="1321">feedback and</p>
<p t="745720" d="4970">Then the last thing I would say is that we&#39;ve some of you know about this already</p>
<p t="750690" d="7169">but we&#39;ve also developed a set of interventions called self authoring and that&#39;s available at self authoring calm and</p>
<p t="758079" d="2300">What self are thering can help you do is?</p>
<p t="760990" d="4909">reconfigure certain elements of your behavior and perhaps over the long run your personality so</p>
<p t="766540" d="4640">the self authoring suite helps you write an autobiography and and detail out the</p>
<p t="771970" d="4880">Both positive and negative experiences of your past so that you can capitalize on the positive</p>
<p t="776949" d="5720">experiences and figure out how to duplicate them and maybe put the negative experiences to rest and we feel that that&#39;s a good way to</p>
<p t="782920" d="1109">reduce</p>
<p t="784029" d="7039">trait neuroticism over the long run and the evidence for that is that writing programs of this sort tend to improve people&#39;s mental health and</p>
<p t="791319" d="3170">decrease their negative emotion so and and</p>
<p t="794769" d="800">stabilize them</p>
<p t="795569" d="3420">So so if you take the personality test and you&#39;re not how</p>
<p t="799139" d="6570">for example with your scores on trait neuroticism you feel that you would benefit from some additional emotional stability then the</p>
<p t="806259" d="5239">past authoring program from the self authoring suite might be something worth considering and then</p>
<p t="811959" d="7969">With regards to the other personality traits um the present authoring program at self authoring com is also a personality</p>
<p t="820179" d="2090">exercise of a sort, but what it helps you do is</p>
<p t="822879" d="1560">Center on your</p>
<p t="824439" d="3950">Virtues and your faults using a Big Five model again so that you can identify</p>
<p t="828639" d="5750">What&#39;s good about your personality and figure out how to capitalize that on that in the future and so that you can identify?</p>
<p t="834609" d="6470">Where your major weaknesses are and figure out how to rectify those and so that&#39;s useful for general personality?</p>
<p t="841209" d="500">work</p>
<p t="841709" d="7349">I would say and then the last one which we&#39;ve done the most research on is called future authoring and the future authoring program</p>
<p t="849459" d="1610">Helps you think about your life</p>
<p t="851069" d="4859">and we think about it as an adjunct to conscientiousness perhaps over the long run and</p>
<p t="856419" d="7640">Also as an exercise that could increase positive and decrease negative emotion bias by helping you establish your goals and also</p>
<p t="864639" d="3049">Stabilizing your view of the world so in the future authoring program</p>
<p t="867689" d="5190">You&#39;re asked to consider your life along about seven dimensions so friendship</p>
<p t="873459" d="1651">intimate relationships</p>
<p t="875110" d="7369">What you do outside of work with your private life in terms of useful and creative activity or enjoyable activity or social activity?</p>
<p t="882970" d="2179">What you&#39;re aiming for in your career?</p>
<p t="885149" d="2339">How you&#39;re going to configure your self?</p>
<p t="887739" d="6320">education how you&#39;re going to take care of yourself mentally and physically and how are you going to handle your use of drugs and alcohol</p>
<p t="894059" d="2429">Because those are pitfalls that people often</p>
<p t="896919" d="2840">Encounter that tear them down and hurt them badly and so</p>
<p t="899860" d="5329">You&#39;re asked to think about yourself three to five years down the road as if you were taking care of yourself</p>
<p t="905309" d="3390">as if you were a valuable person you know because you want to extend that</p>
<p t="909189" d="4489">Courtesy to yourself because you&#39;re as valuable on average as anyone else</p>
<p t="913679" d="6929">and you should treat yourself that way so anyways you&#39;re asked to design a future three to five years down the road where your</p>
<p t="921160" d="5750">experience along each of those dimensions is optimized, and then you&#39;re asked right for 15 minutes about</p>
<p t="927850" d="2959">What your life could be like three to five years down the road if?</p>
<p t="931360" d="3950">You were taking care of yourself the way you should and things were working out properly</p>
<p t="935310" d="3869">so you could imagine that you&#39;re developing a vision of the life that you&#39;d like to lead and</p>
<p t="939250" d="3740">Then you&#39;re asked to reverse that and to write for 15 minutes</p>
<p t="942990" d="4859">And think about this as well about what your life would be like if you let your bad habits and your characterological</p>
<p t="948340" d="6650">weaknesses take the upper hand and auger you into the ground so that you became you know a failure and bitter and resentful and</p>
<p t="955210" d="6080">Isolated and unhappy and and all of the terrible things that go along with bad luck and and also</p>
<p t="961810" d="6949">missed opportunities and let&#39;s call them ethical errors so and then you&#39;re asked to take your positive vision for the future and</p>
<p t="969160" d="4369">elaborate that out into a detailed plan where you justify your</p>
<p t="974050" d="5899">Your goals you you describe what those goals. Are you rank order them in importance you describe?</p>

<p t="993640" d="2929">And so forth and so these are quite extensive</p>
<p t="997090" d="4130">exercises and we developed them you might say as an alternative to</p>
<p t="1001800" d="2000">lengthy and expensive</p>
<p t="1004320" d="6980">Psychotherapy and there&#39;s a fair bit of research evidence suggesting that writing exercises of this sort are extremely effective ways of reconfiguring</p>
<p t="1011730" d="4130">The manner in which you approach the world and so the research we&#39;ve done for example</p>
<p t="1016050" d="5149">In three different locations now and with with several thousand college students although</p>
<p t="1021200" d="6929">this is not a program only designed for college students has indicated that even if you do a relatively poor job of let&#39;s say the</p>
<p t="1028130" d="1110">future authoring program</p>
<p t="1029240" d="5250">And you&#39;re a college student it increases the probability that you&#39;ll stay in your program by about 25%</p>
<p t="1034680" d="780">Which is a?</p>
<p t="1035460" d="570">walloping</p>
<p t="1036030" d="6829">improvement and also has about the same effect on your grade point average and so that seems to be particularly true for people who are</p>
<p t="1042860" d="2820">Doing the worst so it&#39;s been really effective for</p>
<p t="1046800" d="6650">disenchanted ethnic minority males in Holland for example compared to the Dutch national females who</p>
<p t="1053730" d="4970">do better than anyone else in the sample that we looked at two years after the</p>
<p t="1059220" d="2989">Entire group did the future authoring program the?</p>
<p t="1063030" d="3020">ethnic minority males who were underperforming by about eighty percent</p>
<p t="1066920" d="4380">And slightly exceeded the performance of the Dutch national women so that was absolutely</p>
<p t="1071760" d="4880">Staggering result as far as we&#39;re concerned and we also duplicated that at a place in Canada called</p>
<p t="1076640" d="6239">Mohawk College showing that the program worked particularly effectively for men again for males who are underperforming</p>
<p t="1083070" d="2689">females generally speaking in the academic world and</p>
<p t="1086160" d="4609">Especially if they were males who hadn&#39;t done that well in high school and hadn&#39;t carved out a very specified</p>
<p t="1091710" d="5990">Route forward in their academic achievement, so it&#39;s an excellent way of getting your act together and so anyways</p>
<p t="1098430" d="1590">the understand myself</p>
<p t="1100020" d="7010">Comm page is designed to give you a picture of your personality in detail and then the self authoring program is designed to help you</p>
<p t="1107550" d="2029">Reconfigure the way that you approach life</p>
<p t="1109580" d="6030">And so we&#39;re hoping that the combination of those two things are a particularly effective way of bringing high quality</p>
<p t="1116610" d="7760">psychological information and advice and help to a very broad audience at a very low cost and at a relative minimum of demands on</p>
<p t="1124370" d="5550">Time I would say we do know with the self authoring program that the more you write the better it works</p>
<p t="1129920" d="3449">Which is sort of tantamount to saying that the program works better?</p>
<p t="1133440" d="5959">In your life gets better the more you think about the future, which really stands to reason, but it&#39;s nice to see that actually</p>
<p t="1140100" d="5300">Represented and duplicated as part of a scientific research project so anyways</p>
<p t="1145400" d="4410">we&#39;ve tried to keep the programs as reliable as possible as straightforward as possible as</p>
<p t="1150360" d="4670">Dependent on your own actions as possible because the writing is really crucial to</p>
<p t="1155640" d="5449">Reconfiguring your personality and as widely distributed well, and is low cost as we can possibly manage</p>
<p t="1161310" d="2389">We&#39;re trying to provide you with accurate</p>
<p t="1163920" d="630">psychological</p>
<p t="1164550" d="6140">Information so that you understand yourself and other people better and so that your life can be configured in a manner that I hope is</p>
<p t="1170760" d="2959">much more beneficial to you personnel personally and</p>
<p t="1173940" d="7159">Helpful to your family and also has a positive effect on the broader society around you because that&#39;s a great triumvirate of</p>
<p t="1181410" d="4849">Attainment, and it&#39;s exactly what you should be aiming for so I would say I encourage you to</p>
<p t="1187140" d="3709">Determine who you are and to think about that very carefully and then to determine</p>
<p t="1191040" d="3409">Very carefully who you want to be and why and to?</p>
<p t="1195150" d="3589">Make a plan you know you don&#39;t get the opportunity to do that in school</p>
<p t="1199630" d="2000">junior high high school college university</p>
<p t="1201680" d="960">No one ever</p>
<p t="1202640" d="5390">Sits you down and helps you figure out where you came from and who you are and what you&#39;re doing and you really need to</p>
<p t="1208030" d="3809">Know that I should also say that with the understand myself comm site</p>
<p t="1211840" d="6060">We&#39;re also working on our couples module that will enable the people who have filled out the report to</p>
<p t="1218270" d="2000">ask someone else to also do the</p>
<p t="1220370" d="500">questionnaire</p>
<p t="1220870" d="5369">And then they&#39;ll both get a report that details out their similarities and differences so that they can come to understand</p>
<p t="1226460" d="4369">Where they&#39;re going to be in agreement and get along and share interests and where they&#39;re likely to have</p>
<p t="1230900" d="5630">Conflict and what might be done about that and I would say that&#39;s at minimum a month to two months away</p>
<p t="1236530" d="5909">And we&#39;re also going to release a high school version of the self authoring suite so that people can start to plan their lives</p>
<p t="1242600" d="1530">when they&#39;re much younger and</p>
<p t="1244130" d="5329">We&#39;ll only ask the high school students to think about three to six months out into the future because when you&#39;re that young</p>
<p t="1249620" d="5569">That&#39;s about the practical limit of your I wouldn&#39;t say ability to think forward into the future</p>
<p t="1255190" d="2730">But the younger you are the shorter your time horizon</p>
<p t="1258170" d="990">partly because</p>
<p t="1259160" d="4880">Well you you haven&#39;t been exposed to the world that much and there&#39;s you still have plenty to learn so?</p>
<p t="1264040" d="2159">But anyways we have a high school version in the works</p>
<p t="1266200" d="4980">And so I&#39;ll announce that when it comes out and so we all hope that you find these offerings</p>
<p t="1271850" d="2000">useful and practical and</p>
<p t="1275750" d="6050">And that they help you put your life together so that you can be a solid citizen and a responsible person and as</p>
<p t="1282230" d="5750">Emotionally stable as possible and maybe even find some happiness along the way from time to time so that would be really good</p>
