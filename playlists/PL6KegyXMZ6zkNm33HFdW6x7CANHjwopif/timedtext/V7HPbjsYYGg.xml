<p t="200" d="8800">(Applause)</p>
<p t="11820" d="4180">I haven't seen such a good looking bunch of people since the last time I was in Alberta.</p>
<p t="16000" d="1240">(Laughter)</p>
<p t="23540" d="3520">I was originally planning to speak to you about responsibility.</p>
<p t="27480" d="1820">I wanted to suggest</p>
<p t="30420" d="2860">that you should be leery of trusting people whose</p>
<p t="33280" d="2940">primary concern appears to be their own rights</p>
<p t="36220" d="3000">or the rights of the hypothetically oppressed groups</p>
<p t="39220" d="4700">that they hypothetically, but by no means necessarily, speak for.</p>
<p t="44240" d="2100">I still want to do that.</p>
<p t="47540" d="4200">It's better for young people to concentrate on their responsibility rather than their rights.</p>
<p t="52360" d="3360">They've been cared for all their lives by other people</p>
<p t="56120" d="2900">being as-of-yet unable to give back to the world</p>
<p t="59140" d="2080">what it takes to ensure their survival.</p>
<p t="61500" d="3020">It's not merely an issue of obligation, either.</p>
<p t="65240" d="3900">Young people, not only young people, need meaning in their lives.</p>
<p t="69640" d="2600">As well as due regard from others.</p>
<p t="72640" d="2720">And meaning is to be found in responsibility.</p>
<p t="75740" d="3960">People find meaning in the responsibility of their careers, their families,</p>
<p t="79840" d="4700">their friends, the charitable work they do for others, the education they pursue,</p>
<p t="84600" d="5360">the voluntary obligations they undertake, and the suffering they endeavour to reduce.</p>
<p t="90160" d="6580">It's not the rights that are granted to you by others, so that you can be awarded your rewards and privileges</p>
<p t="96740" d="3540">that will make your limited and mortal life worthwhile.</p>
<p t="100880" d="6580">It is instead the sacrifices you make to the highest good that you can conceptualise and strive to attain.</p>
<p t="107780" d="3300">Beware the peddlers of rights.</p>
<p t="111500" d="5300">They wish to turn you into someone who is simultaneously privileged and victimised.</p>
<p t="116940" d="3180">Whiny, narcissistic, noisy,</p>
<p t="120200" d="2880">demanding, chronically unhappy,</p>
<p t="123080" d="2980">and of little use to themselves or other people.</p>
<p t="126560" d="1420">Instead,</p>
<p t="128260" d="1940">sort yourselves out.</p>
<p t="130200" d="4020">Shoulder your responsibilities, make yourself useful to others.</p>
<p t="134500" d="6920">Find the heaviest burden you can bear, and bear it stoically, forthrightly, and admirably.</p>
<p t="143260" d="1720">Having dealt with that,</p>
<p t="145440" d="2900">I'll turn to something that I believe is more pressing.</p>
<p t="148780" d="2860">You're all here because you're concerned about the future.</p>
<p t="151640" d="2460">I'm concerned about the future too.</p>
<p t="154100" d="3780">Because of that concern, I feel it necessary to say a few words</p>
<p t="158020" d="2480">which I am still trying to formulate properly</p>
<p t="160780" d="4060">about the newest form of political pathology to manifest itself</p>
<p t="164840" d="3920">in this, our desperately confused and chaotic western society.</p>
<p t="169300" d="1140">Truly, however,</p>
<p t="170995" d="1760">I should not say ";newest";;</p>
<p t="173960" d="5860">I should say instead ";the resurgence of an exceptionally dangerous, logically incoherent,</p>
<p t="179900" d="2840">and thoroughly discredited, old idea.";</p>
<p t="183140" d="5320">One that doomed entire societies and huge populations to unnecessary suffering</p>
<p t="188560" d="4500">in a bloody and unfortunate and all-too-forgotten 20th century.</p>
<p t="193580" d="1620">The idea?</p>
<p t="195560" d="1160">Equality.</p>
<p t="197240" d="3480">A reasonable value, in place among other values,</p>
<p t="200720" d="4560">but a deadly god when elevated to the highest place and promoted blindly</p>
<p t="205500" d="6580">and with an undertone of undeserved martyrdom, resentment, jealousy, spite, and hate.</p>
<p t="212740" d="3520">It is not just equality in its more banal manifestations,</p>
<p t="216260" d="5380">not merely equality of opportunity, say, that I want to talk about, but 'equity'.</p>
<p t="222640" d="1780">Equality of outcome.</p>
<p t="224620" d="3880">The ultimate rabid wolf in the most caring of sheep's clothing.</p>
<p t="228680" d="4880">The flag of equity is being raised everywhere, and it's the very 'Social Justice Warriors',</p>
<p t="233560" d="4120">the very post-modern, neo-marxist activists whose words I despise</p>
<p t="237700" d="1660">who are waving it everywhere.</p>
<p t="239740" d="3140">The danger this presents can barely be overstated.</p>
<p t="243220" d="1720">It needs to be stopped.</p>
<p t="245580" d="4280">When I spoke at McMaster university last year, the profane chanters,</p>
<p t="250100" d="7100">students under the spell of their reprehensible professor's ideological idiocy, insisted repetitively</p>
<p t="257360" d="5880">";This is where we draw the line! This is where we draw the line! This is where we draw the line!";,</p>
<p t="263360" d="6460">referring to my hypothetical bigotry and uncaring attitude toward the individuals they purported to represent.</p>
<p t="270180" d="4900">Today I want to draw a line of my own, and I encourage you to join me in doing so.</p>
<p t="275740" d="6960">We have to bring the confused, historically ignorant, and resentful purveyors of the terrible doctrine</p>
<p t="282700" d="2760">of equality of outcome, to a halt.</p>
<p t="285740" d="5320">We have to draw a line before the functional structures that make up our society are undermined</p>
<p t="291060" d="2020">and damaged beyond repair.</p>
<p t="293620" d="5840">So I'm going to talk to you today about the great errors that the self-righteously caring attitude</p>
<p t="299460" d="4260">of the Equity-Purveyors hide within the confines of their low resolution,</p>
<p t="303900" d="4080">incautious, algorithmic, idealogical propaganda.</p>
<p t="308520" d="5920">I cannot present a complete argument, but I can at least outline the territory that must be mapped in more detail</p>
<p t="314440" d="1820">and publicised broadly.</p>
<p t="317380" d="1580">For decades,</p>
<p t="319100" d="2320">hypothetically well-meaning people on the left</p>
<p t="321420" d="4880">have been beating the drum for a society where equality of opportunity is the norm.</p>
<p t="326380" d="5760">By and large, this is also a goal supported by people in the political centre and on the right.</p>
<p t="332140" d="6540">Society is better served, and individuals better provided with the means of moving forward forthrightly and with hope,</p>
<p t="338820" d="4580">when arbitrary impediments to the realisation of their abilities are eliminated...</p>
<p t="343540" d="2000">to the degree that is possible.</p>
<p t="346800" d="7820">However, even the elimination of inequities related to opportunity is something that must be attempted with all due care.</p>
<p t="355080" d="4620">The ability to raise children thoughtfully and carefully,</p>
<p t="359780" d="3660">and to provide them with high-quality education, social networks,</p>
<p t="363480" d="3220">and the opportunity to develop their own skills and interests</p>
<p t="366740" d="3480">is not something equally distributed amongst all parents.</p>
<p t="370580" d="4700">This means that some children with be provided with opportunities that others will lack.</p>
<p t="375480" d="4680">Government, or other organisations, may attempt to provide redress for such inequality,</p>
<p t="380160" d="1400">but that's done at some risk;</p>
<p t="381880" d="4840">a substantial proportion of what is done positively for children in good families</p>
<p t="386900" d="4620">occurs at such a young age that government intervention, however well meaning,</p>
<p t="391740" d="4900">would mean invasion, occupation, and colonisation of the family to a degree</p>
<p t="396640" d="5980">likely to produce negative consequences that far outweigh whatever positive good might be done.</p>
<p t="403200" d="7000">A good rule of thumb might be that our society should strive to do whatever good can be done for disadvantaged children and their parents</p>
<p t="410540" d="3640">that does not simultaneously interfere with, or make more difficult,</p>
<p t="414180" d="5720">the good that is already being done by parents who are skilled and fortunate enough to do the demanding job</p>
<p t="419900" d="2800">in an admirable and socially productive manner.</p>
<p t="423220" d="4880">Substantive debate between those on the left interested in broad-scale social interventions</p>
<p t="428140" d="3240">to improve life quality for those who are less fortunate,</p>
<p t="431480" d="5080">and those on the right who wish to protect and maintain the integrity and the rights of the family,</p>
<p t="436560" d="6180">must continue untrammelled so that the dangers that lurk on the unmoderated extremes can be minimised.</p>
<p t="443500" d="3100">We don't want to let any children suffer unnecessarily.</p>
<p t="446920" d="5040">We don't want the abilities and skills they might develop and offer to society to be wasted.</p>
<p t="452320" d="3980">But we don't want impersonal, large-scale systems</p>
<p t="456480" d="2820">suffering from the pathologies of gigantism</p>
<p t="459300" d="3100">to interfere with the function of the basic family unit</p>
<p t="462480" d="1980">which, despite its inadequacies,</p>
<p t="464520" d="5020">has yet to be replaced, even conceptually, by anything remotely as functional.</p>
<p t="471060" d="4820">The provision of universal secondary, and to-a-degree post-secondary, education</p>
<p t="476140" d="2760">has levelled the playing field substantially.</p>
<p t="479180" d="4220">The safety net provided by universal healthcare plays the same role.</p>
<p t="483540" d="5580">As does the offering of old-age pensions, disability allowances, unemployment insurance, and welfare.</p>
<p t="490000" d="3320">Although individuals across the political spectrum continue to debate</p>
<p t="493320" d="6220">the details of size and implementation associated with such methods of income redistribution,</p>
<p t="499600" d="4080">there is substantial agreement among all regarding their essential utility.</p>
<p t="505740" d="2620">It might be also noted that there are conservative,</p>
<p t="508360" d="2560">as well as liberal and left-wing arguments to be made</p>
<p t="510920" d="3100">in favour of some flattening of income inequality;</p>
<p t="514320" d="2640">the data indicating that serious crime</p>
<p t="517080" d="3560">including, most importantly, male-on-male homicide</p>
<p t="520840" d="3040">may be driven to levels that threaten social stability when</p>
<p t="523880" d="3760">inequality increases beyond some hypothetical optimum,</p>
<p t="527820" d="2000">are solid and persuasive.</p>
<p t="529960" d="5420">Thus, there is a case to be made for enhanced social stability through the intelligent distribution</p>
<p t="535480" d="3100">of at least opportunity, and perhaps of income itself.</p>
<p t="538720" d="5580">As well as the case that is made by more left-leaning individuals of behalf of abstract fairness.</p>
<p t="544480" d="920">Nonetheless,</p>
<p t="545940" d="3620">there are already questionable practices associated with</p>
<p t="549640" d="3860">improvement of equality of opportunity.</p>
<p t="553500" d="2660">Let it be set in place, in addition to those already noted,</p>
<p t="556160" d="2600">these include most particularly</p>
<p t="558760" d="2520">the so-called 'affirmative action' programs</p>
<p t="561360" d="4740">that have become almost universally instantiated in the hiring, placement, and promotion processes</p>
<p t="566100" d="4320">that characterise most large, modern institutions.</p>
<p t="570920" d="4440">In place, theoretically, to provide redress for historical inequalities</p>
<p t="575560" d="5700">such as the history of slavery that characterised the American black population some six generations ago.</p>
<p t="582700" d="2780">Perhaps the case can be made for such things as well,</p>
<p t="585480" d="2420">although they are associated with clear dangers.</p>
<p t="588060" d="2420">The most egregious of these is the insistence,</p>
<p t="590480" d="6080">tied integrally to the claims of those enamoured with post-modern identity politics,</p>
<p t="596560" d="2840">that certain group-oriented aspects of human identity</p>
<p t="599440" d="4840">such as race, sex, and now sexual proclivity and gender identity,</p>
<p t="604280" d="2540">are sufficiently real and important</p>
<p t="606880" d="5180">so that judgement of people on the grounds of individual competence alone should be suspended</p>
<p t="612120" d="2960">in favour of ill-defined claims of 'social justice'.</p>
<p t="615480" d="4040">On the minor end, these include statements in job postings indicating that</p>
<p t="619520" d="6240">applications from individuals with certain specified group-level attributes are particularly welcome.</p>
<p t="626720" d="3120">What dangers are associated with such practices?</p>
<p t="630080" d="1000">Well,</p>
<p t="631080" d="3340">the first is that specifying particular welcome</p>
<p t="634500" d="2560">on the part of some groups clearly implies</p>
<p t="637120" d="1820">less welcome on the part of others,</p>
<p t="639020" d="3400">as the post-modern theorists who push such things forward</p>
<p t="642520" d="1740">would be first to point out.</p>
<p t="644380" d="5360">Such thinkers constantly make the claim that value structures by necessity exclude,</p>
<p t="649740" d="2080">and should be flattened for that reason.</p>
<p t="651980" d="4480">They don't extend the same rationale to attempts to hire preferentially, however,</p>
<p t="656480" d="4740">because the Marxism that lurks behind their hypothetically pure, post-modern reasoning</p>
<p t="661280" d="3380">justifies identification of people by group identity</p>
<p t="664660" d="1820">and selection on that basis.</p>
<p t="666640" d="3800">Because of its insistence that the dialectic of 'oppressor' and 'oppressed'</p>
<p t="670580" d="3060">characterises all so-called 'power structures'.</p>
<p t="674260" d="3100">The second problem is that only a very narrow subset</p>
<p t="677360" d="2720">of the wide range of potential group identities,</p>
<p t="680400" d="2040">and therefore group inequalities,</p>
<p t="682440" d="3880">can possibly be identified and rectified by such practices.</p>
<p t="686560" d="4220">Privileging those elements of group identity above all others,</p>
<p t="690920" d="3920">again, using the appalling terminology of the Post-Modernists themselves,</p>
<p t="694920" d="7040">mean instantiating those, and only those, elements as vitally characteristic of the individuals in question.</p>
<p t="702540" d="4140">To encourage, or select, on the basis of race, and sex,</p>
<p t="706680" d="4940">and the other sacred descriptors of the modern anti-individual left,</p>
<p t="711620" d="6260">is simultaneously to insist that those are the categories upon which people should be judged.</p>
<p t="718280" d="3840">It doesn't take much in the way of intelligence and insight</p>
<p t="722120" d="3240">to see how easily this process can be reversed,</p>
<p t="725560" d="3700">and used in the opposite direction by those on the radical right</p>
<p t="729300" d="7400">who might be inclined to insist that race and sex are precisely the relevant categories by which people should be judged</p>
<p t="737060" d="3940">for the very purposes of exclusion and prejudicial discrimination</p>
<p t="741000" d="2740">that those on the left hypothetically oppose.</p>
<p t="743960" d="2920">";What's sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander.";</p>
<p t="748880" d="3620">Such a reversal is making itself currently manifest</p>
<p t="752560" d="3820">in the increasing proclivity of those attacked, for example,</p>
<p t="756380" d="2940">for their quote, 'white privilege', end-quote</p>
<p t="759340" d="4640">to start insisting on their racial identity as a primary hallmark,</p>
<p t="763980" d="4520">and to shift from guilt to overt claims of supremacy.</p>
<p t="769000" d="2560">What else would you possibly expect?</p>
<p t="771800" d="2520">Something very similar happened with the 'Black Power'</p>
<p t="774320" d="1640">and 'Black is Beautiful' movements</p>
<p t="775960" d="2160">in the late 60's and early 70's.</p>
<p t="778660" d="1720">The third problem</p>
<p t="780780" d="1620">is the tendency for demands</p>
<p t="782400" d="1900">for equality of opportunity</p>
<p t="784380" d="2680">to devolve ever more rapidly and seriously</p>
<p t="787060" d="2020">into demands for equity,</p>
<p t="789260" d="2180">which is now become defined as equality,</p>
<p t="791520" d="3040">not of opportunity, but of outcome itself.</p>
<p t="795140" d="3060">This is happening currently at a rate that beggars belief</p>
<p t="798200" d="3080">given the absolute catastrophes that social,</p>
<p t="801280" d="2820">economic, and political policies predicated</p>
<p t="804100" d="3120">on the equality of outcome have produced in the past.</p>
<p t="807860" d="2220">What does 'equity' mean?</p>
<p t="810620" d="1660">It's predicated on two ideas,</p>
<p t="812280" d="2140">each more pernicious than the other.</p>
<p t="814580" d="3280">The first is that all social institutions must produce</p>
<p t="817940" d="3500">outcomes, of whatever sort, that are precisely equal</p>
<p t="821440" d="2660">across all possible group identities.</p>
<p t="824380" d="2260">The second is that social institutions that</p>
<p t="826640" d="2520">do not produce those equal outcomes</p>
<p t="829160" d="3120">do not produce them because of institutional racism,</p>
<p t="832340" d="2400">sexism, or other-ism,</p>
<p t="834780" d="2920">that is as well characteristic of the explicit</p>
<p t="837800" d="5760">and implicit prejudices of those individuals who make up the institutions in question.</p>
<p t="843560" d="4720">There are a number of logical reasons why such demands cannot be met,</p>
<p t="848360" d="2760">and are not desirable, even in principle.</p>
<p t="851580" d="3880">Surrounding those logical reasons is a plethora of historical data</p>
<p t="855460" d="3480">indicating, most recently in Venezuela,</p>
<p t="858940" d="5500">that economic policies predicated on the idea of radical equality are catastrophic,</p>
<p t="864460" d="1760">even genocidal.</p>
<p t="866380" d="2520">We'll start with the logical reasons.</p>
<p t="869460" d="4280">To determine whether a given institution is inequitable,</p>
<p t="873920" d="5580">the institution is first stratified according to the hypothetical privilege and power it awards</p>
<p t="879500" d="4460">to different individuals who occupy different positions within it.</p>
<p t="884860" d="760">Then,</p>
<p t="885660" d="3260">the demographic make-up of those strata are analysed</p>
<p t="888940" d="5880">along lines of racial, ethnic, sexual, and gender identity as well as sexual proclivity,</p>
<p t="895140" d="6840">and contrasted with the demographics that obtain in the general population surrounding the institution.</p>
<p t="902700" d="1980">What is wrong with this?</p>
<p t="905260" d="1000">First,</p>
<p t="906960" d="5320">such analysis are predicated on the idea that institutions primarily function</p>
<p t="912320" d="3180">to distribute resources and reward.</p>
<p t="915860" d="2700">That's only one of the many functions.</p>
<p t="918640" d="5440">It's a hallmark of the kind of ideologically rigid conceptualisation that drives such assessments</p>
<p t="924160" d="2500">that only one factor is ever considered.</p>
<p t="926680" d="5540">This makes being right, and being self-righteous about it, a very straightforward matter,</p>
<p t="932440" d="6020">radically and absurdly reducing the cognitive demands that a truly comprehensive analysis would require.</p>
<p t="938560" d="8760">Complex, hierarchical, social organisations are not simply mechanisms for distributing resources and rewards.</p>
<p t="947500" d="5920">Nor are they, in case it needs to be said, merely structures of power, privilege, and oppression.</p>
<p t="953820" d="2440">They are in part, of course, both of these.</p>
<p t="956360" d="4820">In tyrannical societies they may mostly be both of these.</p>
<p t="961740" d="3280">But in functional, and free societies,</p>
<p t="967300" d="4500">such as those that primarily characterise the west, despite its flaws,</p>
<p t="971960" d="3680">they are also structures of responsibility and production.</p>
<p t="975980" d="2480">The evidence for this is overwhelming.</p>
<p t="978740" d="3200">By historical and current world standards,</p>
<p t="981940" d="3920">people in the west are well-housed and well-fed.</p>
<p t="986040" d="5020">In fact, we're more currently threatened by obesity than starvation.</p>
<p t="991380" d="1980">With few exceptions,</p>
<p t="993360" d="4740">everyone has indoor plumbing, central heating, access to eduction,</p>
<p t="998160" d="2200">and connections to the world wide web,</p>
<p t="1000520" d="7720">which provides, on an entirely reliable basis, more information at lower cost than has ever been available previously.</p>
<p t="1008380" d="4920">The fact that the West does this with great efficiency, comparatively speaking,</p>
<p t="1013400" d="4320">can be seen in the fact that immigrants move, virtually without exception,</p>
<p t="1017800" d="5400">from the great bulk of dysfunctional, tyrannical societies from all over the world,</p>
<p t="1023220" d="6620">to the comparatively free and productive countries of Europe, North America, Australia, and New Zealand.</p>
<p t="1030120" d="1580">And not the reverse.</p>
<p t="1031800" d="7180">(Applause)</p>
<p t="1039120" d="6680">Our complex social tools of production make and do things, and more importantly,</p>
<p t="1045860" d="3120">make and do things that people want</p>
<p t="1048980" d="4480">regardless of what might be regarded as their consumerist triviality.</p>
<p t="1053620" d="5580">No centrally planned economy produces a selection of shampoos or toothbrushes,</p>
<p t="1059260" d="3160">or automatic watch winders, or kite-surfing kites,</p>
<p t="1062420" d="2800">or lightweight bicycles, or video games.</p>
<p t="1065300" d="3440">A haughty-minded and judgemental 'social justice' advocate</p>
<p t="1068740" d="3480">might dismiss such hyper-production as trivial,</p>
<p t="1072440" d="3160">but it still very likely to spend hours per day</p>
<p t="1075640" d="3880">texting his or her friends desirable political cliches</p>
<p t="1079520" d="2720">on expensive iPhones and Androids.</p>
<p t="1082900" d="2720">";One man's meat is another man's poison.";</p>
<p t="1085720" d="1720">And it is by no means clear who should judge</p>
<p t="1087440" d="2520">whether something that someone else desires</p>
<p t="1090040" d="5920">may be acceptably produced in a world where absolute privation still exists.</p>
<p t="1097580" d="4480">Because our hierarchical organisations make new things that people want</p>
<p t="1102200" d="3320">and because people differ in their competence in doing so,</p>
<p t="1105600" d="3340">different people experience different demand for their services.</p>
<p t="1109100" d="2600">We adjudicate such demand with pay.</p>
<p t="1111840" d="2740">This is the alternative to slavery.</p>
<p t="1115260" d="3120">If you are producing things that people want</p>
<p t="1118560" d="4540">then you are entitled to charge what people are willing to pay for your services.</p>
<p t="1123220" d="4700">Or, to refuse to provide such services at your whim, if you choose.</p>
<p t="1128020" d="4040">You get this privilege because what you provide for other people has value.</p>
<p t="1132340" d="4660">And it is therefore useful for other people to encourage you to continue to provide it.</p>
<p t="1137140" d="4300">They don't have to buy what you're offering, either, any more than you have to produce it.</p>
<p t="1141900" d="5500">Although that's not the very definition of freedom, it certainly constitutes an important element of freedom.</p>
<p t="1148300" d="4460">Because some people are more competent at making or doing those things,</p>
<p t="1152760" d="2760">they can demand a higher price for their participation.</p>
<p t="1155740" d="2300">This is because of what they're offering,</p>
<p t="1158160" d="2820">not because of what they intrinsically deserve.</p>
<p t="1161680" d="4020">It may be the case that unearned elements of identity</p>
<p t="1165780" d="4700">determine, to some degree, the differential probability that any given individual</p>
<p t="1170560" d="4560">will come to occupy a place where he or she can offer the fruits of their labour.</p>
<p t="1175200" d="3880">But it is also the case that their skill at production is a major contributor.</p>
<p t="1179140" d="2380">This has been demonstrated empirically.</p>
<p t="1181800" d="3780">Complex jobs; administrative, managerial, and academic,</p>
<p t="1185620" d="5460">require high intelligence and high levels of the Big Five personality trait 'conscientiousness'.</p>
<p t="1191080" d="5500">The most careful of psychometric investigations into such things have clearly demonstrated</p>
<p t="1196660" d="2800">that a combination of intelligence and conscientiousness,</p>
<p t="1199600" d="2020">which can both be accurately measured,</p>
<p t="1201800" d="4700">correlates at about 0.6 with long-term life success in such occupations.</p>
<p t="1206780" d="4280">Some of the remaining variation in success can be attributed to random factors,</p>
<p t="1211180" d="5120">such as health and, even counter-productively, unfair, systemic prejudice</p>
<p t="1216300" d="2420">along with a fair degree of measurement error,</p>
<p t="1218720" d="3480">as productivity and success are notoriously hard to quantify.</p>
<p t="1222300" d="980">Nonetheless,</p>
<p t="1223280" d="4640">correlations of that magnitude are exceptionally rare in the social and health sciences,</p>
<p t="1227920" d="3260">and they are not be easily and carelessly dismissed.</p>
<p t="1231640" d="4560">The same thing can be said with regards to success in entrepreneurial and creative endeavours</p>
<p t="1236280" d="3420">which, when complex, also require intelligence</p>
<p t="1239800" d="2320">but demand Big Five trait 'openness'</p>
<p t="1242200" d="4980">which is a dimension indexing capacity to produce novel ideas and perceptual frames.</p>
<p t="1247420" d="6900">To the degree that traits obviously, and logically, linked to productive success actually predict such success,</p>
<p t="1254560" d="8220">the systems in which such success manifests itself can be regarded as examples of 'fair and reasonable' games.</p>
<p t="1263340" d="3400">It should also be pointed out that many such games exist</p>
<p t="1266740" d="5900">so that people who are not conscientious, or intelligent, or creative, still have a chance to win</p>
<p t="1272780" d="3700">in popularity, say, in desire for leisure time,</p>
<p t="1276480" d="3300">in the formulation of close inter-personal relationships,</p>
<p t="1279780" d="2320">or in the provision of safety and security.</p>
<p t="1282120" d="3700">These other domains of potential achievement are differentially valued by people</p>
<p t="1285840" d="3440">in accordance with their intrinsic traits of personality.</p>
<p t="1289280" d="4480">This means that person who is primarily agreeable, for example,</p>
<p t="1293840" d="4380">may well choose to maximise their engagement in inter-personal relationships</p>
<p t="1298280" d="2960">at the cost of career or entrepreneurial success.</p>
<p t="1301360" d="3120">And who is to say that's not a reasonable trade-off?</p>
<p t="1305060" d="1720">It is also the case</p>
<p t="1306780" d="4980">that there are many more elements of group identity that must be reasonably considered</p>
<p t="1311760" d="5800">if the case can be made that the elements of race and sex, etc. must be considered.</p>
<p t="1317940" d="2940">People are differentially successful because...</p>
<p t="1321100" d="1200">they're older.</p>
<p t="1322540" d="2020">Older people are wealthier</p>
<p t="1324620" d="1200">Well, why?</p>
<p t="1325820" d="3040">Well, because they've had their whole life to generate wealth.</p>
<p t="1328960" d="3020">Is that fair or unfair? Should it be rectified?</p>
<p t="1331980" d="1460">Or, is it reasonable?</p>
<p t="1333520" d="1700">There are [advantages to being] younger;</p>
<p t="1335320" d="2000">you're better at sports if you're younger,</p>
<p t="1337320" d="3040">you're more likely to attract sexual partners if you're younger.</p>
<p t="1340360" d="3280">Some things are better for men, some things are better for women.</p>
<p t="1343680" d="2480">Some things are better for attractive people.</p>
<p t="1346220" d="5560">Some things are better for people who are of the majority race, or religion, or tribe, or language.</p>
<p t="1352240" d="4040">Some things are more accessible to unattractive people,</p>
<p t="1356280" d="3380">so character acting, for example, falls into that category.</p>
<p t="1359720" d="1880">People have different interests.</p>
<p t="1361600" d="1820">People have different education.</p>
<p t="1363420" d="2900">People have different levels of mental and physical health.</p>
<p t="1366320" d="3480">And people differentially regulate their use of drugs and alcohol.</p>
<p t="1369800" d="3960">Those are all dimensions upon which people can be categorised by group,</p>
<p t="1373800" d="3960">and there's no reason to privilege race, sex, sexual identity,</p>
<p t="1377760" d="7140">gender identity, gender expression, and [sexual proclivity]</p>
<p t="1385020" d="5120">above these other dimensions of group identity which are equally valid</p>
<p t="1390180" d="2080">and play an equally important role.</p>
<p t="1393200" d="3180">People judge different outcomes as of different worth.</p>
<p t="1396540" d="3580">Love, children, leisure, power, duty, service,</p>
<p t="1400120" d="3740">pleasure, aesthetics, novelty, spirituality.</p>
<p t="1404020" d="5140">All of these factors, and many more, combine to determine inequitable outcomes.</p>
<p t="1409740" d="4860">How then should people be properly categorised to ensure equity?</p>
<p t="1414820" d="4700">Even a small set of entities can be categorised a near-infinite number of ways.</p>
<p t="1419520" d="2380">Whose going to measure all these differences?</p>
<p t="1422160" d="3700">Whose going to determine which of them are important, and which of them aren't?</p>
<p t="1426160" d="3120">Whose going to measure the outcomes and sum them up?</p>
<p t="1429720" d="2380">To complicate issues further,</p>
<p t="1432100" d="6460">who is going to determine whether they are biologically instantiated, socially constructed, or mere choice?</p>
<p t="1438640" d="1840">Apparently, like gender.</p>
<p t="1441300" d="3580">Are they mutable, or fixed and deterministic?</p>
<p t="1445200" d="3240">If they are mutable, merely as a matter of choice,</p>
<p t="1448440" d="6340">as legislation in Canada now insists, for example, with regards to gender identity and gender expression,</p>
<p t="1454780" d="5000">then should those differences also be regarded as relevant determinants of inequity?</p>
<p t="1459860" d="5500">If people can change their group categorisations merely as a consequence of an act of will,</p>
<p t="1465440" d="4880">why would you consider that a relevant category to determine levels of inequality?</p>
<p t="1470680" d="1260">Furthermore,</p>
<p t="1472000" d="3160">whose going to measure and determine the rewards?</p>
<p t="1475240" d="5220">Are we going to insist that everyone must be equally popular and outgoing?</p>
<p t="1480740" d="2400">Equally assertive and enthusiastic?</p>
<p t="1483140" d="2200">Equally private and introverted?</p>
<p t="1485420" d="3220">Caring? Polite? Or demanding and competitive?</p>
<p t="1488740" d="1580">Industrious and orderly?</p>
<p t="1490460" d="2060">Creative and interested in ideas?</p>
<p t="1492900" d="6280">Why are those outcomes less important or less worthy of note than corporate position or economic compensation?</p>
<p t="1501760" d="1900">Or are we going to swallow, without question,</p>
<p t="1503660" d="5420">the idea that career position and monetary gain are the only genuine values that exist</p>
<p t="1509140" d="2500">that should be considered and are worthy of merit?</p>
<p t="1511820" d="4280">It's a very strange thing for those on the radical left to insist</p>
<p t="1516100" d="5560">that the very criteria by which large corporations judge the utility of individuals</p>
<p t="1521660" d="5580">are precisely those that should be used to assess equality of outcome, fairness, and diversity.</p>
<p t="1528420" d="1740">Let's say it again:</p>
<p t="1530380" d="5480">It isn't what you deserve for intrinsic reasons that determines your outcome;</p>
<p t="1536000" d="4100">It's the worth that others attribute to your offerings.</p>
<p t="1540140" d="1540">Think of an offering on eBay.</p>
<p t="1543740" d="1840">No seller says,</p>
<p t="1545660" d="4660">";I am Azerbaijan and my mother has Alzheimer's</p>
<p t="1550320" d="3340">and I'm not well-educated, but I'm tall and strong</p>
<p t="1553660" d="3120">although not very attractive and I was bullied as a child</p>
<p t="1556780" d="3440">but I'm quite musical, although I only have one friend</p>
<p t="1560220" d="2940">and I'm slightly overweight and prone to anxiety,</p>
<p t="1563160" d="4280">so you have to pay me fifty dollars for my second-hand crock-pot.";</p>
<p t="1567560" d="1220">(Laughter)</p>
<p t="1568780" d="9640">(Applause)</p>
<p t="1578460" d="1640">They say, instead,</p>
<p t="1580100" d="4600">";I have this item, and you don't care who I am</p>
<p t="1584720" d="2000">and I don't care who you are,</p>
<p t="1586800" d="4440">except that I will describe it honestly and ship it, and you will pay for it,</p>
<p t="1591240" d="3720">if we can agree on a mutually beneficial price.";</p>
<p t="1595120" d="3720">That's trade. The reward runs both ways.</p>
<p t="1598840" d="2640">Trade is not charity.</p>
<p t="1601940" d="2300">Trade is mutually beneficial.</p>
<p t="1604280" d="5500">Trade does not, and cannot, rectify historical or biological injustices.</p>
<p t="1609780" d="7000">It can only partly, and momentarily, satisfy the people engaged in the particular trade.</p>
<p t="1616940" d="4220">Attempts to redistribute through trade tend to kick back.</p>
<p t="1621420" d="1520">Look at Venezuela:</p>
<p t="1623060" d="4400">People there have now lost an average of 18 lbs.</p>
<p t="1627700" d="2160">Cuba can barely feed itself.</p>
<p t="1629900" d="3100">Everything is run down and barely functional.</p>
<p t="1633220" d="3220">I think one of the most comical things I have seen in recent years</p>
<p t="1636440" d="9060">was the motor convoy transferring Fidel Castro's damned corpse to the cemetery</p>
<p t="1645520" d="2560">breaking down in the middle of the procession.</p>
<p t="1648080" d="860">(Applause)</p>
<p t="1649020" d="4200">Hardly hope for a better possible outcome for that tyrant.</p>
<p t="1653220" d="1220">(Applause)</p>
<p t="1654660" d="2440">Everything is run down and barely functional.</p>
<p t="1657220" d="880">Why?</p>
<p t="1658340" d="2840">Because the problem of distribution is so complex</p>
<p t="1661200" d="3740">that it has to be outsourced to the collective intelligence.</p>
<p t="1665120" d="6100">No person, group of persons, or imaginable computational device,</p>
<p t="1671280" d="2980">can perform the calculations of price.</p>
<p t="1674440" d="2320">The measurements can't even be made.</p>
<p t="1677000" d="6220">This is because the price of anything is dependent on the price of everything else.</p>
<p t="1683660" d="3060">And, to make it worse, is always shifting.</p>
<p t="1686940" d="5320">Flawed as the free-market system is, we don't have anything better.</p>
<p t="1693160" d="6400">But let's say instead that we transfer determination of power, status, privilege, and desire</p>
<p t="1699640" d="1540">to a group of people.</p>
<p t="1701660" d="1280">What group?</p>
<p t="1703160" d="3260">How do we regulate their biases and correct for their ignorance?</p>
<p t="1706420" d="1700">How do we limit their power?</p>
<p t="1708260" d="4420">How do we protect ourselves against their ideologies, and hatred, and resentments?</p>
<p t="1713040" d="4320">How do we discriminate the desire to help the unfortunate,</p>
<p t="1717400" d="4540">from the wish to destroy the well-constituted and successful?</p>
<p t="1722540" d="1140">We don't.</p>
<p t="1723860" d="1000">And we can't.</p>
<p t="1724980" d="1360">And we won't.</p>
<p t="1726680" d="4680">What will happen is that those best at political manoeuvring,</p>
<p t="1731360" d="2420">most convinced of their righteousness,</p>
<p t="1733900" d="3920">least aware of their ignorance and limitations of knowledge,</p>
<p t="1737820" d="3600">and soon, most filled with resentment and hatred,</p>
<p t="1741540" d="3300">will instantly rise to dominate such positions</p>
<p t="1744840" d="2160">and then all Hell will break out.</p>
<p t="1747420" d="1640">How do we know this?</p>
<p t="1749320" d="2000">Because it already happened.</p>
<p t="1751720" d="2840">And it killed 100 million people</p>
<p t="1754560" d="3640">and made untold others destitute and miserable.</p>
<p t="1758200" d="2620">And it just about destroyed the world.</p>
<p t="1761560" d="3480">We already ran this experiment, and it failed.</p>
<p t="1765040" d="3240">And then we ran it again, and it failed.</p>
<p t="1768280" d="3200">And then we ran it again, and then it failed.</p>
<p t="1771480" d="2160">And then we replicated the failure.</p>
<p t="1773640" d="6100">No-one who is not ignorant would dare to experiment with such things again,</p>
<p t="1779760" d="2780">unless they were truly malevolent.</p>
<p t="1782960" d="1980">So, which is it?</p>
<p t="1784980" d="4640">You purveyors of equity, you merchants of yesterday's poison,</p>
<p t="1789620" d="2860">are you ignorant, or malevolent?</p>
<p t="1792480" d="7720">(Applause)</p>
