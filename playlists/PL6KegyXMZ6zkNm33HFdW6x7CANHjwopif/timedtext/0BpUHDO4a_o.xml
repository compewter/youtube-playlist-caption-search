<p t="1880" d="5320">I don’t know how many of you got my email
this morning, but this is the last class.</p>
<p t="7200" d="5480">And so, I sent in my email a link to the other
lecture that was supposed to happen, but I</p>
<p t="12680" d="5060">have to go to a conference on Thursday and
Friday and so I’m going to do the last lecture</p>
<p t="17740" d="6599">today, and you can watch the second-last lecture
from last year, which will cover the territory,</p>
<p t="24339" d="3340">hopefully, sufficiently well.</p>
<p t="27679" d="7051">So, I usually use the last lecture to sort
of sum up where we’ve been and also to talk</p>
<p t="34730" d="9800">to people about… let me open it up here
first… about my more specific thoughts on</p>
<p t="44530" d="4440">personality.</p>
<p t="48970" d="39450">So I think that’s probably what I’ll do
today.</p>
<p t="88420" d="12059">I’ll start with what we’ve… where we’ve
been.</p>
<p t="100479" d="12581">So I started talking to you about mythological
representations of personality, and I wanted</p>
<p t="113060" d="7250">to do that for a variety of reasons, but the
most important was to place the rest of the</p>
<p t="120310" d="5219">course in a deep history context, essentially.</p>
<p t="125529" d="6051">Because personality is the consequence of
very many things.</p>
<p t="131580" d="8390">And many of them are grounded in our biology
and therefore grounded in evolution.</p>
<p t="139970" d="6800">And I generally think that in some ways, the
social sciences don’t take evolution seriously</p>
<p t="146770" d="1000">enough.</p>
<p t="147770" d="6890">They don’t take the fact that we’re 3.5
billion years old seriously enough.</p>
<p t="154660" d="3090">It’s a serious thing.</p>
<p t="157750" d="8180">And some of that is evident in a relatively
straightforward way conceptually, in that</p>
<p t="165930" d="4900">we share so much of our biological platform
with other creatures.</p>
<p t="170830" d="6250">You know, there was a recent genomic analysis,
I think, of gorillas.</p>
<p t="177080" d="4000">And I don’t remember what percentage of
our DNA we share with gorillas, but it’s</p>
<p t="181080" d="4701">like 99.2% or something like that, which,
you know, is quite shocking, until you realise</p>
<p t="185781" d="4399">that we share about 70% of our genetic make-up
with yeast.</p>
<p t="190180" d="6000">So, you know, yeah, obviously we’re a lot
closer to gorillas than to yeast, but we’re</p>
<p t="196180" d="2800">still pretty damn close to yeast.</p>
<p t="198980" d="7870">And it also indicates not necessarily just
how similar we are to gorillas, but how minor</p>
<p t="206850" d="5720">modifications in a genome can also make substantial
differences, because alike as we are to gorillas,</p>
<p t="212570" d="6410">we’re a lot different from them too.</p>
<p t="218980" d="5030">So there’s the biological aspect, which
is really important.</p>
<p t="224010" d="4060">But then there’s what you might describe
as a quasi-biological element, which seems</p>
<p t="228070" d="8720">to be operating in the space between biology
as evolutionarily determined, and culture.</p>
<p t="236790" d="5750">Those things are often… you know, we have
an archetypal tendency to consider culture</p>
<p t="242540" d="4140">as something in opposition to nature.</p>
<p t="246680" d="3191">And there’s utility in that, from a heuristic
point of view.</p>
<p t="249871" d="3709">You can do a lot with that division from a
conceptual perspective.</p>
<p t="253580" d="4570">But in a lot of ways it’s misleading.</p>
<p t="258150" d="5660">Because some of the primordial elements of
culture are biological.</p>
<p t="263810" d="6840">And I think the most striking example of that,
fundamentally, is… there’s two striking</p>
<p t="270650" d="1000">examples.</p>
<p t="271650" d="7640">One is the existence of structures of power,
or structures of authority, or structures</p>
<p t="279290" d="9390">of influence; hierarchies, which are incredibly
old, at least 400 million years old.</p>
<p t="288680" d="5980">And which have in consequence been around
for so long that you also have to think about</p>
<p t="294660" d="3640">them as part of the environment, part of nature.</p>
<p t="298300" d="7600">Because we tend to think of the hierarchical
structure as cultural, and also as easily</p>
<p t="305900" d="1320">alterable, in some sense.</p>
<p t="307220" d="5650">But there’s no reason to think that, given
that it’s been around, as I pointed out</p>
<p t="312870" d="3210">in one lecture, longer than trees.</p>
<p t="316080" d="5880">It’s a very, very permanent element of the
environment that human beings find themselves</p>
<p t="321960" d="1060">in.</p>
<p t="323020" d="4970">So much so that… you know, you can think
of a dominance hierarchy as the prototype</p>
<p t="327990" d="6690">of culture, but because it’s been a constant
environmental feature for so long, our nervous</p>
<p t="334680" d="4940">systems are built for operation within a hierarchy,
and they’re really built that way, and it’s</p>
<p t="339620" d="1860">not a trivial matter.</p>
<p t="341480" d="6050">Because the serotonin system that regulate
our emotions (because the serotonin system</p>
<p t="347530" d="6120">does that, fundamentally), is also the system
that sets up your brain during fetal development.</p>
<p t="353650" d="6510">The serotonin system is above all, perhaps,
concerned with calibrating your nervous system</p>
<p t="360160" d="3480">in accordance with your position in a hierarchy.</p>
<p t="363640" d="7050">And its basic rule is, the higher in a hierarchy
you are, the less negative emotion you have</p>
<p t="370690" d="1000">to feel.</p>
<p t="371690" d="5449">And the lower in the hierarchy you are, and
the more tenuous your actual life (because</p>
<p t="377139" d="4271">there’s a direct connection between the
tenuousness of your life and your position</p>
<p t="381410" d="3680">in a dominance hierarchy), the more negative
emotion you’re going to feel.</p>
<p t="385090" d="7799">And then that has drastic consequences and
those are best exemplified in longevity.</p>
<p t="392889" d="4961">So there was a famous study called the Whitehall
study, which was done in Britain.</p>
<p t="397850" d="9090">And basically what they were looking at was
health, including mortality, of English civil</p>
<p t="406940" d="1000">servants.</p>
<p t="407940" d="3250">And the first study was done 50 years before
the second study.</p>
<p t="411190" d="3020">I think the second study was done in the 80s.</p>
<p t="414210" d="6340">Anyways, in the first study, you have a power
hierarchy, with the top civil servants at</p>
<p t="420550" d="3390">the top, obviously, and the bottom civil servants
at the bottom.</p>
<p t="423940" d="7600">And you might ask yourself, what constitutes
top and bottom, and some of it might be regarded</p>
<p t="431540" d="3550">as autonomy over choices.</p>
<p t="435090" d="4299">So that would be part of it, you can make
choices so you have a bit more control over</p>
<p t="439389" d="1750">what’s going to happen to you.</p>
<p t="441139" d="5691">But also, the probability that you have a
stable and productive place is higher the</p>
<p t="446830" d="2660">higher you go and lower the lower you go.</p>
<p t="449490" d="4130">And the consequence of that, all things considered,
is that the civil servants at the bottom of</p>
<p t="453620" d="7250">the dominance hierarchy died younger and more
frequently than those at the top.</p>
<p t="460870" d="5610">Now you could attribute that to poverty, right,
because the people at the bottom, especially</p>
<p t="466480" d="5210">in the 1930s, were materially deprived in
comparison to the people at the top, although</p>
<p t="471690" d="5410">they certainly weren’t materially deprived
in comparison, say, to UK citizens a hundred</p>
<p t="477100" d="4129">years before, or to most people in the world
at that time.</p>
<p t="481229" d="6431">So, a poverty argument is hard to make, although
a relative poverty argument is easier to make.</p>
<p t="487660" d="6660">But then, 50 years later, Britain was a lot
richer, and so the absolute level of wealth</p>
<p t="494320" d="6330">of the entire hierarchy moved up substantially,
so that the people at the bottom were richer</p>
<p t="500650" d="4269">than the people in the middle in the previous
study.</p>
<p t="504919" d="5191">But the pattern of overall mortality remained
quite similar.</p>
<p t="510110" d="7510">And you know, the importance of studies like
that, as well as studies that indicate the</p>
<p t="517620" d="6210">consequence of income inequality on behaviour,
are so important that they should be put front</p>
<p t="523830" d="2260">and center in university curricula.</p>
<p t="526090" d="6820">I mean one of the things that really bothers
me about the humanities education in particular,</p>
<p t="532910" d="4100">although some of the social science education
too, for modern university students, is that</p>
<p t="537010" d="3370">there are some things we know that you’re
never taught.</p>
<p t="540380" d="4350">And it’s really appalling, especially the
relative poverty issue, because most of the</p>
<p t="544730" d="6600">phenomena that people tend to attribute to
poverty have nothing to do with poverty.</p>
<p t="551330" d="1780">It’s relative poverty.</p>
<p t="553110" d="2700">And that is absolutely not the same thing.</p>
<p t="555810" d="3890">Because the first one is a material deprivation
hypothesis.</p>
<p t="559700" d="6670">But if you think about it, there’s almost
no one in America who’s materially deprived.</p>
<p t="566370" d="3730">Now you know, you could become… and I’m
not saying there’s no one.</p>
<p t="570100" d="2370">I’m saying there’s almost no one.</p>
<p t="572470" d="4340">And you know, it also depends on your definition
of material deprivation, but most people,</p>
<p t="576810" d="4670">the vast majority of people, have too much
to eat, and a place to live.</p>
<p t="581480" d="6540">And, you know, once you have plumbing and
heating, and food, and access to information,</p>
<p t="588020" d="5240">you’ve pretty much got everything that wealth
can give you that isn’t relative.</p>
<p t="593260" d="3050">The privation part of it is gone.</p>
<p t="596310" d="6710">But relative poverty, relative position, is
an unbelievably powerful determinant of almost</p>
<p t="603020" d="1980">everything that you could imagine.</p>
<p t="605000" d="4550">So, longevity is one, health is another.</p>
<p t="609550" d="1770">And a lot of those are stress-related.</p>
<p t="611320" d="3390">It’s a lot more stressful at the bottom
than it is at the top.</p>
<p t="614710" d="3720">I’ll tell you something interesting we found
out about conservatism.</p>
<p t="618430" d="1390">And this is… when I wrote…</p>
<p t="619820" d="4800">I wrote a book called Maps of Meaning a long
while back, and I realised that I was trying</p>
<p t="624620" d="7150">to account for why people are prone to identifying
so strongly with their belief systems, you</p>
<p t="631770" d="1000">know.</p>
<p t="632770" d="5350">And part of it, in some sense, was a control
over negative outcomes hypothesis.</p>
<p t="638120" d="7190">So partly, if you have an ideological theory,
it’s a set of tools that you can use, with</p>
<p t="645310" d="3230">quite a bit of proficiency, to operate in
the world, right?</p>
<p t="648540" d="3870">Simplification strategy enables you to control
uncertainty.</p>
<p t="652410" d="2270">It also enables you to communicate with people.</p>
<p t="654680" d="6720">But even more importantly, to the degree that
we share a cultural system, we can predict</p>
<p t="661400" d="1000">each other.</p>
<p t="662400" d="3610">And that’s not psychological, it’s you
act out the game and I act out the game, and</p>
<p t="666010" d="2300">so, I don’t really have to know much about
you.</p>
<p t="668310" d="4390">And I don’t have to assume that you’re
a barrel of snakes.</p>
<p t="672700" d="2389">I can assume that you’re more or less like
me.</p>
<p t="675089" d="3611">And so if we interact I don’t have to be
on constant alert.</p>
<p t="678700" d="3690">And so that’s not a psychological function
of a belief system.</p>
<p t="682390" d="2250">That’s a direct, real world function.</p>
<p t="684640" d="4570">And if you listen to people like the terror
management theorists, they’re always telling</p>
<p t="689210" d="4749">you how belief systems protect people against
psychological uncertainty, or maybe the fear</p>
<p t="693959" d="1000">of death.</p>
<p t="694959" d="6531">They never tell you that shared belief system
actually prevent from death, which is even</p>
<p t="701490" d="3840">more important than protecting you from the
fear of death.</p>
<p t="705330" d="6810">So, there is the stabilisation of society
aspect that’s a motivator for maintaining</p>
<p t="712140" d="1129">a set of shared beliefs.</p>
<p t="713269" d="2581">Because it kind of makes us identical.</p>
<p t="715850" d="2440">Which you might say is bad on the side of
individuality.</p>
<p t="718290" d="1950">It’s like yeah, yeah, individuality.</p>
<p t="720240" d="4219">It’s really good on the side of not having
to assume that the next person is going to</p>
<p t="724459" d="1081">kill you.</p>
<p t="725540" d="3010">And that’s way more important than individuality.</p>
<p t="728550" d="3690">You know, the other thing that I’d like
to make a case for briefly is that, you know,</p>
<p t="732240" d="1000">in the West…</p>
<p t="733240" d="2190">people think that Western people are individualistic.</p>
<p t="735430" d="3030">That’s the stupidest theory ever I think.</p>
<p t="738460" d="3890">Except for maybe the theory that poverty is
at the root of all these social problems that</p>
<p t="742350" d="1000">we see.</p>
<p t="743350" d="1480">Western people are hardly individual at all.</p>
<p t="744830" d="5730">All you have to do is go out and look at traffic
patterns to figure that out.</p>
<p t="750560" d="2360">Everybody stops at a red light.</p>
<p t="752920" d="2500">Everybody crosses when the walk signal turns.</p>
<p t="755420" d="6720">Virtually everybody waits in line when there’s
a line-up for some restricted access event.</p>
<p t="762140" d="2640">We all dress the same way, men and women alike.</p>
<p t="764780" d="3250">You know, we follow the rules like mad, like
crazy.</p>
<p t="768030" d="4590">And then on top of that there’s a bit of
fluff, which is the things we could do if</p>
<p t="772620" d="4580">we were free, which we could talk about and
dream about but which hardly anybody does.</p>
<p t="777200" d="2420">And that’s what looks like individuality.</p>
<p t="779620" d="3520">So you get that freedom, but the cost of it
is incredible obedience.</p>
<p t="783140" d="5450">But you know, the fact of the obedience is
that, well, you can sit here for example,</p>
<p t="788590" d="1860">and look at this, it’s all safe and everything.</p>
<p t="790450" d="3920">And you can come here with all these other
weird primates and you don’t know a damn</p>
<p t="794370" d="5210">thing about them, and they come from all sorts
of different places but there’s a shared</p>
<p t="799580" d="5150">social structure and everybody participates
in the game and then all of a sudden, it’s</p>
<p t="804730" d="1000">basically safe.</p>
<p t="805730" d="1000">Fine.</p>
<p t="806730" d="3740">That’s one reason for conservatism and for
identification with a belief system.</p>
<p t="810470" d="4660">It’s like stabilise the damn game so you
can predict the other primates.</p>
<p t="815130" d="4930">And a lot of people who talk about conservatism
as a political belief make the assumption</p>
<p t="820060" d="9000">that that control element is the fundamental
motivator for right-wing political belief.</p>
<p t="829060" d="6140">But weirdly enough, the other thing that happens
when you stabilise a game, let’s say, which</p>
<p t="835200" d="6040">would be a shared belief, is that you provide
a goal.</p>
<p t="841240" d="4280">Because a shared value system is always oriented
towards a goal.</p>
<p t="845520" d="2720">Otherwise it’s not a value system, it’s
not a belief system.</p>
<p t="848240" d="4300">And the things is, and this is a Piagetian
point, as soon as you organise something around</p>
<p t="852540" d="6520">a goal, you give the people opportunity to
do two things… three things.</p>
<p t="859060" d="5120">Cooperate within the rule framework, compete
within the rule framework, so that brings</p>
<p t="864180" d="4780">in the possibility of victory and loss, and
also to experience some positive emotion.</p>
<p t="868960" d="6950">Because if we haven’t unified our game (which
is basically the job of a bloody three-year</p>
<p t="875910" d="7010">old), and so we’re each playing our own
games, there’s no way that we can collectively</p>
<p t="882920" d="2640">aim at something and there’s no way that
you can progress.</p>
<p t="885560" d="6390">So you know one of the things that, when you’re
taught about the oppressive structure, say,</p>
<p t="891950" d="4760">of the patriarchal system, one of the things
that’s never noted is that because that’s</p>
<p t="896710" d="5270">a hierarchical system, it’s also a pre-condition
for any kind of victory.</p>
<p t="901980" d="1840">And that would even be victory over yourself.</p>
<p t="903820" d="4870">If you want to be better tomorrow than you
are today, basically what you’re doing is</p>
<p t="908690" d="4450">aiming at a point that’s defined by the
value system, so that’s aiming up, and trying</p>
<p t="913140" d="1360">to move yourself towards.</p>
<p t="914500" d="5310">If you get rid of that shared value system
there’s no structure for positive emotion</p>
<p t="919810" d="1280">anymore.</p>
<p t="921090" d="4840">So, part of the reason people want to stabilise
their belief systems is so that the environment</p>
<p t="925930" d="5440">(mostly other people, but also the environment)
remains under control, and thank God for that,</p>
<p t="931370" d="8409">because otherwise it’s just outright bloody
chaos.</p>
<p t="939779" d="5120">But the other reason is, no game, no winners.</p>
<p t="944899" d="1501">Nothing to do.</p>
<p t="946400" d="6810">And that’s, I think, why there’s an orthogonal
relationship between agreeableness and conscientiousness.</p>
<p t="953210" d="5439">You know, conscientiousness seems to do something
like stabilise rule structures across long</p>
<p t="958649" d="1101">periods of time.</p>
<p t="959750" d="5610">So it kind of defines the game explicitly,
and that lays out the possibility of a hierarchy</p>
<p t="965360" d="1479">and a value system.</p>
<p t="966839" d="2831">And then agreeableness says hey, don’t get
too carried away with that.</p>
<p t="969670" d="4140">You know, you don’t want to make the game
so damn tight that the losers stack up at</p>
<p t="973810" d="1550">zero and die.</p>
<p t="975360" d="3120">You know, it’s egalitarianism versus justice…</p>
<p t="978480" d="3940">I mean, that’s not exactly it, but it’s
something like that.</p>
<p t="982420" d="4289">You know, everybody should go to university.</p>
<p t="986709" d="2741">Fine, egalitarian presupposition.</p>
<p t="989450" d="3000">The people who work hard and study should
do better.</p>
<p t="992450" d="2010">Well that’s a presupposition of justice.</p>
<p t="994460" d="1480">And those aren’t the same thing, right?</p>
<p t="995940" d="2940">Actually they work somewhat in opposition
to one another.</p>
<p t="998880" d="4870">So you could say let everyone into university
and fail half of them in the first year.</p>
<p t="1003750" d="4470">And that’s kind of what they do in places
in Holland, whereas we have fairly structured</p>
<p t="1008220" d="1669">admission criteria.</p>
<p t="1009889" d="5021">But you know, we can see the tension there,
because if you let everybody into university,</p>
<p t="1014910" d="5440">then the really smart people are being dragged
far… they’re being put into a position</p>
<p t="1020350" d="4250">where they’re able to advance much more
slowly than they would otherwise.</p>
<p t="1024600" d="4030">So that’s a real price to pay at the top
of the distribution.</p>
<p t="1028630" d="4240">On the other hand you’re opening up opportunities
for people who for one reason or another might</p>
<p t="1032870" d="4309">have not done well in high school or previously
but could actually thrive in university.</p>
<p t="1037179" d="4471">But you see that those things… you know,
there’s two value structures there and it’s</p>
<p t="1041650" d="4200">not easy to optimise them and that’s exactly
why I think we have those two parallel personality</p>
<p t="1045850" d="1000">dimensions.</p>
<p t="1046850" d="2510">And it’s real hell when one of them gets
the upper hand.</p>
<p t="1049360" d="3050">You know, part of it is balance.</p>
<p t="1052410" d="1030">Inclusion and hierarchy.</p>
<p t="1053440" d="6180">You need to have those things operating at
the same time.</p>
<p t="1059620" d="5610">So, back to the mythological representations.</p>
<p t="1065230" d="6110">I mean, partly what you see in mythological
representations of reality, and we have to</p>
<p t="1071340" d="6940">talk about reality a bit too, is the presence
of something that represents the hierarchy.</p>
<p t="1078280" d="7330">I would say, you know, in fairy tales that’s
often the king, wise king or otherwise, and</p>
<p t="1085610" d="4650">then in religious mythology it’s usually
something that represents the king or the</p>
<p t="1090260" d="1000">Father.</p>
<p t="1091260" d="5740">And I think that’s because the primary social
hierarchies among human beings are masculine</p>
<p t="1097000" d="1850">in nature.</p>
<p t="1098850" d="6620">And I think that’s probably because, well
men are more like pack animals.</p>
<p t="1105470" d="1930">And why aren’t women?</p>
<p t="1107400" d="5230">Well, I think the reason for that is that
the things that men did historically had a</p>
<p t="1112630" d="5990">communal element, like a goal-directed communal
element that wasn’t as prevalent in female</p>
<p t="1118620" d="1189">dominance hierarchies?</p>
<p t="1119809" d="6921">It’s something like that.</p>
<p t="1126730" d="3930">So there’s a representation of the hierarchy.</p>
<p t="1130660" d="4500">But then there’s a counter-representation,
which is a representation of the individual.</p>
<p t="1135160" d="4100">And that’s another really tight balance
that societies have to manage…</p>
<p t="1139260" d="7289">“I don’t want you to be too different,
because if you’re too different, I can’t</p>
<p t="1146549" d="1641">predict you”.</p>
<p t="1148190" d="3990">And you may actually be a threat to the integrity
of the society, because you might come up</p>
<p t="1152180" d="5790">with something so wild and so unconstrained
that it just blows the entire game into pieces.</p>
<p t="1157970" d="6330">On the other hand, to the degree that I’m
a rigid hierarchy, I’m going to fall behind</p>
<p t="1164300" d="1620">as the environment transforms.</p>
<p t="1165920" d="3490">And the environment, the natural environment,
let’s say, or the environment that’s outside</p>
<p t="1169410" d="3600">the dominance hierarchy, is also something
that is stably represented in mythology.</p>
<p t="1173010" d="4321">And so one of the things that you see happening
is there’s a hierarchy, and the other thing</p>
<p t="1177331" d="5228">is there’s a force outside the hierarchy
and it’s often represented by an eye.</p>
<p t="1182559" d="2631">So you see this in a variety of ancient myths.</p>
<p t="1185190" d="5810">And that represents the capacity of the individual
to pay attention and to maintain and update</p>
<p t="1191000" d="1000">the hierarchy.</p>
<p t="1192000" d="2860">So you’ve this dance between the individual
and the hierarchy.</p>
<p t="1194860" d="5689">The hierarchy structures the individual and
disciplines them, and produces a cultured</p>
<p t="1200549" d="6221">being, but then hopefully the cultured being
kind of pops up above the hierarchy and then</p>
<p t="1206770" d="5750">can start, you know, altering it, hopefully
relatively minimally, where it’s necessary.</p>
<p t="1212520" d="6610">It’s very much akin to Piaget’s idea that
once children hit higher levels of moral development:</p>
<p t="1219130" d="4780">first of all they play alone, then they can
play with others, then they know the rules,</p>
<p t="1223910" d="4500">and then morality is following the rules,
and after that, and not every child gets to</p>
<p t="1228410" d="5290">this point (at least according to Piaget),
the child starts to guard him or herself as</p>
<p t="1233700" d="3320">something that can make the rules.</p>
<p t="1237020" d="5250">So you could think about that as the (and
Piaget did), as the pinnacle of ethical development.</p>
<p t="1242270" d="6170">And whether or not that’s the pinnacle is
debatable, because I think Jung… see Jung</p>
<p t="1248440" d="4060">extended that idea, although people never
think of this as a variation on Piagetian</p>
<p t="1252500" d="1080">theory.</p>
<p t="1253580" d="8860">So, for Piaget, once you hit individual status,
you pop out of the group and you hit individual</p>
<p t="1262440" d="4110">status, it’s not like you’re a rule-breaker,
because you can follow the rules, and usually</p>
<p t="1266550" d="4140">do, but you can observe them and modify them
when necessary.</p>
<p t="1270690" d="5050">It’s almost exactly what your consciousness
does to your own internal neural structure.</p>
<p t="1275740" d="4590">So for example imagine you’re playing a
piano, and you’ve automatized most of it.</p>
<p t="1280330" d="3969">So you’ve built little machines in the back
of your head to take care of the trills, let’s</p>
<p t="1284299" d="4291">say, and the arpeggios, and then you make
a mistake.</p>
<p t="1288590" d="5150">Well your consciousness picks up the mistake,
and then you slow down what you’re doing</p>
<p t="1293740" d="2980">and observe yourself for the motor errors.</p>
<p t="1296720" d="3730">And then you correct them, which is difficult,
and then you practise and practise and practise</p>
<p t="1300450" d="3510">and practise, and you automate the new routine,
and then you go on.</p>
<p t="1303960" d="5450">And so what consciousness is doing is watching
output, and when there’s a mismatch between</p>
<p t="1309410" d="2810">what you’re aiming at and what happens,
you stop.</p>
<p t="1312220" d="1770">That’s basically anxiety.</p>
<p t="1313990" d="3990">You make your error correction, and that fixes
the hierarchy, and then you go on.</p>
<p t="1317980" d="3699">Well that’s really the relationship of the
individual to society as well.</p>
<p t="1321679" d="4481">Now Jung pushed that idea a fair bit further.</p>
<p t="1326160" d="4470">And I might as well tell you about this, we
never discussed this in our section on Jung,</p>
<p t="1330630" d="1760">but it’s pretty interesting.</p>
<p t="1332390" d="7430">Let’s see if I can get this right.</p>
<p t="1339820" d="8820">Okay, so Jung basically presumed that as you
were socialised, you developed a persona.</p>
<p t="1348640" d="4870">And the persona was you insofar as you’re
socialised.</p>
<p t="1353510" d="6060">Now you can see personae when you listen to
someone who’s very, very concerned with</p>
<p t="1359570" d="5590">their appearance and whose speech is somewhat
false as a consequence.</p>
<p t="1365160" d="4351">You know, so they don’t seem genuine, they
seem too polished, let’s say, or something</p>
<p t="1369511" d="1000">like that, you know.</p>
<p t="1370511" d="2499">There’s not a lot of emotion, for example,
in their speech.</p>
<p t="1373010" d="5029">They’re very self-contained and concerned
with their public appearance, which seems</p>
<p t="1378039" d="6020">also to be a very undesirable consequence
of spending too much time on social media.</p>
<p t="1384059" d="3990">Because it’s all persona development, eh,
it’s not necessarily a good thing.</p>
<p t="1388049" d="5831">It does seem to be associated with higher
rates of depression.</p>
<p t="1393880" d="6090">Anyways, your persona is you as socialised
being.</p>
<p t="1399970" d="4880">And so Jung would say yeah, obviously you
can be socialised.</p>
<p t="1404850" d="4340">And what that means is that some of you is
invited out to play and to develop, but a</p>
<p t="1409190" d="4060">lot of you is left undifferentiated, or even
forbidden.</p>
<p t="1413250" d="4590">So for example, this happens with agreeable
people.</p>
<p t="1417840" d="1930">Agreeable people think aggression is wrong.</p>
<p t="1419770" d="4450">Well that’s not very useful, because first
of all it’s not wrong, and second of all</p>
<p t="1424220" d="2450">because they have the capacity for aggression.</p>
<p t="1426670" d="4749">And so if that isn’t brought out to play,
it sits at home in its closet and gets all</p>
<p t="1431419" d="4671">warped and bent and only comes out at night
to cause trouble.</p>
<p t="1436090" d="5050">And so one of the things Jung would say is
well (this is part of the exploration of the</p>
<p t="1441140" d="5160">shadow), there’s going to be you as persona
and then there’s this mesh-mash of undeveloped</p>
<p t="1446300" d="5390">and resentful potential, roughly speaking.</p>
<p t="1451690" d="6830">And your job is to transmute your moral system
and integrate all that stuff that was rejected</p>
<p t="1458520" d="1870">into your personality.</p>
<p t="1460390" d="3480">And that often involves a descent into the
underworld and a rebirth.</p>
<p t="1463870" d="3520">And that’s another mythological motif.</p>
<p t="1467390" d="10460">So his idea was… you could think about it
this way.</p>
<p t="1477850" d="6850">So Piaget said at the utmost step of moral
development, you view yourself as someone</p>
<p t="1484700" d="2140">who could alter the rules.</p>
<p t="1486840" d="3670">And Jung would say wait a minute, there’s
another point in that.</p>
<p t="1490510" d="6029">Not only do you alter the rules, you alter
them so you can include things that were denied</p>
<p t="1496539" d="2811">or forbidden by the previous system of rules.</p>
<p t="1499350" d="3189">And so it’s a more inclusive game.</p>
<p t="1502539" d="4651">And part of what it includes is those parts
of you that you’d cast off because they</p>
<p t="1507190" d="3070">were socially inappropriate.</p>
<p t="1510260" d="1260">And often…</p>
<p t="1511520" d="4850">Freud’s comment about that sort of thing
was that that was often sexuality and aggression,</p>
<p t="1516370" d="4130">partly because those are kind of individual
in nature, and they’re kind of integrate</p>
<p t="1520500" d="1059">into a social group.</p>
<p t="1521559" d="1911">And people will take offense to them.</p>
<p t="1523470" d="3199">I mean, look what’s happening on college
campuses.</p>
<p t="1526669" d="4130">Universities are spending more time worrying
about sexual assault than they are worrying</p>
<p t="1530799" d="1490">about education.</p>
<p t="1532289" d="3391">And the reason for that is, the reason we’re
just describing.</p>
<p t="1535680" d="4470">It’s that sexuality and aggression are very
hard to integrate.</p>
<p t="1540150" d="1510">So they remain on the outside.</p>
<p t="1541660" d="3780">Now you might say, suppress it, for Christ’s
sake.</p>
<p t="1545440" d="3550">Get your sexuality under control and eradicate
your aggression.</p>
<p t="1548990" d="4640">That’s a stupid idea because we know what
happens when you do that.</p>
<p t="1553630" d="5450">You turn into a little milk-soppy sort of
creature with a tremendous amount of resentment,</p>
<p t="1559080" d="3089">and then you sporadically explode.</p>
<p t="1562169" d="3161">Plus you’re denying yourself immense depth
in your personality.</p>
<p t="1565330" d="5240">You know, like a person who has repressed
their aggression and their sexuality, generally,</p>
<p t="1570570" d="2300">is just dull as you can possibly imagine.</p>
<p t="1572870" d="2110">You don’t even want to talk to them.</p>
<p t="1574980" d="4460">Whereas someone who has that integrated, they’re
far more interesting, you know, because there’s</p>
<p t="1579440" d="5479">a provocative element, and a teasing element,
and a dangerous element, and a colourful element,</p>
<p t="1584919" d="4801">and all those things that make, you know,
social interactions much more interesting.</p>
<p t="1589720" d="6020">It’s… you know, you’re playing with
fire, at that point in your personality development,</p>
<p t="1595740" d="2870">but human beings are born to play with fire.</p>
<p t="1598610" d="2220">So you don’t want to deny yourself that.</p>
<p t="1600830" d="5520">So anyways, so Jung’s idea of continued
moral development was, you know, haul the</p>
<p t="1606350" d="4230">oppressed self out of captivity, so to speak.</p>
<p t="1610580" d="5350">Notice what you’re doing, partly to refuse
to take responsibility, but also partly just</p>
<p t="1615930" d="4710">to tame yourself so that you’re at least
not annoying, and get that other stuff up</p>
<p t="1620640" d="1260">into the game.</p>
<p t="1621900" d="7279">So he would think of that, at least in part,
as the union of the articulated self with</p>
<p t="1629179" d="6921">the unarticulated self, a lot of which would
be grounded in emotion and motivation.</p>
<p t="1636100" d="2130">So that’s… he thought of that as a conjunction.</p>
<p t="1638230" d="2760">That’s conjunction #1.</p>
<p t="1640990" d="7940">So that’s the bringing together of spirit
and soul, or articulated and self and inarticulated</p>
<p t="1648930" d="1340">self, something like that.</p>
<p t="1650270" d="5039">So now you’re an organised, from the perspective
of your psyche, but then there’s another</p>
<p t="1655309" d="1000">step.</p>
<p t="1656309" d="3081">So now you think of that as an organised thing.</p>
<p t="1659390" d="3050">The next step is to integrate that with your
body.</p>
<p t="1662440" d="9119">And that basically means, not only to have
that integrated state of being as a belief</p>
<p t="1671559" d="6431">system, and system of representation at perception,
but also to act it out in the world.</p>
<p t="1677990" d="4450">Because it’s one thing to know something,
it’s another thing to do it.</p>
<p t="1682440" d="3720">But if you really know it, there’s no difference
between knowing it and doing it.</p>
<p t="1686160" d="4790">Okay, so then your mind and your body are
unified.</p>
<p t="1690950" d="4470">And then there’s a third step after that,
which is really quite complex, and this is</p>
<p t="1695420" d="3450">where Jung starts to shade into phenomenological
perspectives.</p>
<p t="1698870" d="5570">So you know, when we were talking about phenomenology
one of the things I pointed out was that the</p>
<p t="1704440" d="5410">phenomenologists are playing a… you can
say they’re playing a complex philosophical</p>
<p t="1709850" d="1939">game, and the game is ‘what if?’</p>
<p t="1711789" d="5151">And the what if is: okay, forget about the
idea of subjective and objective, just forget</p>
<p t="1716940" d="1780">about it for a moment, okay?</p>
<p t="1718720" d="1930">We’ll start with a new set of presuppositions.</p>
<p t="1720650" d="5750">The presuppositions are that everything you
experience is real.</p>
<p t="1726400" d="2350">And everything you experience is you.</p>
<p t="1728750" d="2150">So you say, reality is experience.</p>
<p t="1730900" d="5970">But there’s an implication to that, and
the implication is that, insofar as you’re</p>
<p t="1736870" d="5240">part of my experience, the separation between
us is illusory.</p>
<p t="1742110" d="7640">And so the next stage that Jung proposed was
that the integrated self eliminates the distinction</p>
<p t="1749750" d="2260">between self and other.</p>
<p t="1752010" d="5549">So that would be recognition, for example,
and everyone already knows this, that it’s</p>
<p t="1757559" d="4671">pretty hard for me to be stable and happy
if I see you miserable and suffering.</p>
<p t="1762230" d="1690">Well why is that?</p>
<p t="1763920" d="5540">Well, it’s because, insofar as I encounter
you, at least, your misery and suffering is</p>
<p t="1769460" d="1830">my misery and suffering.</p>
<p t="1771290" d="2750">You know, unless I’m psychopathic to the
nth degree.</p>
<p t="1774040" d="3340">And so the idea that… and that has to be
taken care of.</p>
<p t="1777380" d="2510">Well I mean, you certainly see this in the
realm of the family.</p>
<p t="1779890" d="7210">If you’re in a family and one of your family
members is, you know, not doing well in a</p>
<p t="1787100" d="4480">manner they can’t help, or not doing well
in a manner they can help, the probability</p>
<p t="1791580" d="5349">that that’s going to have a direct bearing
on your quality of being is 100%.</p>
<p t="1796929" d="2811">In fact it might be the prime determinant.</p>
<p t="1799740" d="6900">And so then you have to seriously ask yourself,
what makes you think you’re separate?</p>
<p t="1806640" d="3200">And you know, a phenomenologist would say
well, you know, that’s your assumption that</p>
<p t="1809840" d="4060">the subject/object divide is absolute, that’s
what makes you think you’re separate.</p>
<p t="1813900" d="4380">And so, the final step… it’s kind of akin
to a Dostoyevsky idea.</p>
<p t="1818280" d="6870">Dostoyevsky posited, in one of his weird sort
of transcendent moments, that everything that</p>
<p t="1825150" d="5190">happened to you was not only your fault, but
everything that happened to everyone was your</p>
<p t="1830340" d="1040">fault.</p>
<p t="1831380" d="2300">And he didn’t mean it precisely like that.</p>
<p t="1833680" d="6090">He meant it more like, everything that happens
to you is your responsibility, and everything</p>
<p t="1839770" d="3920">that happens to everyone else is also your
responsibility.</p>
<p t="1843690" d="6390">And that’s a… well it’s an insane claim,
to some degree, because it broadens the realm</p>
<p t="1850080" d="6360">of your responsibility out to unlimited reach.</p>
<p t="1856440" d="4450">But life is an insane thing, and so there’s
no reason to assume that just because that,</p>
<p t="1860890" d="5130">you know, seems exaggerated to the point of
irrationality, that it’s wrong.</p>
<p t="1866020" d="3900">There’s lots of things about life that are
exaggerated to the point of irrationality.</p>
<p t="1869920" d="3389">Like the fundamental structure of life is
irrational.</p>
<p t="1873309" d="6701">You’re born arbitrarily, there you are in
your particular time and place, you live in</p>
<p t="1880010" d="3700">accordance with your talents and limitations,
and then at the end of that, there’s no</p>
<p t="1883710" d="1000">you anymore.</p>
<p t="1884710" d="2970">It’s like, good luck making that rational.</p>
<p t="1887680" d="3040">Like it’s intrinsically irrational.</p>
<p t="1890720" d="6290">And one of the things that really advanced
theories of human development posit is that</p>
<p t="1897010" d="4950">to answer an irrational question, you need
an irrational answer.</p>
<p t="1901960" d="2930">And I think that’s exactly right.</p>
<p t="1904890" d="6020">If life is an impossible burden, which is
clearly the case, then you need an impossible</p>
<p t="1910910" d="4190">goal to set against it to justify it.</p>
<p t="1915100" d="4040">And part of that might be well, you know,
get your act together, improve the quality</p>
<p t="1919140" d="6120">of being around you, but then that starts
to stretch its tentacles to include more and</p>
<p t="1925260" d="1330">more people.</p>
<p t="1926590" d="6660">And so… you know, one of the things I’ve
thought about for a long time is, there’s</p>
<p t="1933250" d="6059">this proclivity of people to flee, into let’s
say, nihilism, for every good reason under</p>
<p t="1939309" d="3911">the books, or ideological possession.</p>
<p t="1943220" d="3400">And the alternative to those two things you
might think of as chaos.</p>
<p t="1946620" d="3750">Well, nihilism is sort of a form of chaos
anyways.</p>
<p t="1950370" d="3140">It’s not surprising that people become nihilistic.</p>
<p t="1953510" d="1000">Plus it’s easy.</p>
<p t="1954510" d="4899">And it’s not surprising that they become
ideologically possessed, plus it’s easy.</p>
<p t="1959409" d="2811">The question is, is there any reasonable alternative
to that?</p>
<p t="1962220" d="3750">And if you read people like Ernest Becker,
who wrote a book called The Denial of Death</p>
<p t="1965970" d="5340">(he was a hyper-Freudian, really), his whole
hypothesis, like the terror management theorists</p>
<p t="1971310" d="5950">(who derived their ideas from Becker, by the
way), is that everything people do is illusory.</p>
<p t="1977260" d="2900">You know, no matter what it is, it’s an
illusion.</p>
<p t="1980160" d="4220">And so the fundamental underlying reality
of human life is that it’s hopeless.</p>
<p t="1984380" d="3960">Well, God, you know, that’s a hell of a
conclusion to draw.</p>
<p t="1988340" d="7480">And I think it’s clearly the wrong conclusion,
because it leads to places you just do not</p>
<p t="1995820" d="1290">want to go.</p>
<p t="1997110" d="2590">And for me, that’s enough evidence that
there’s something wrong with it.</p>
<p t="1999700" d="4460">You know, like if you’re following a path
and it’s leading to Auschwitz, I would say</p>
<p t="2004160" d="2840">hey, there’s something wrong with that path.</p>
<p t="2007000" d="2740">And you might say, well all paths are equally
absurd.</p>
<p t="2009740" d="5880">It’s like yeah, okay, but some of them really
hurt, and maybe we could do without those.</p>
<p t="2015620" d="3559">I think it’s very difficult to dispute that.</p>
<p t="2019179" d="5941">I mean you can, but what you have to say then
is, all the pain and suffering in the world</p>
<p t="2025120" d="3100">doesn’t matter, you know, along with all
the good stuff.</p>
<p t="2028220" d="3730">You can make that irrelevant right away, just
by doubt.</p>
<p t="2031950" d="7180">But you’re really going to take the next
step and say, all that human-induced and unnecessary</p>
<p t="2039130" d="3090">pain and suffering is actually meaningless
and irrelevant?</p>
<p t="2042220" d="5820">It’s like, I think yeah, put that person
in jail now, before they do something really</p>
<p t="2048040" d="1000">dangerous.</p>
<p t="2049040" d="4059">Well I don’t really mean that but you get
the point.</p>
<p t="2053099" d="5330">You draw a conclusion like that, which is
a logical conclusion of nihilism… it’s</p>
<p t="2058429" d="3200">like, all bets are off for you.</p>
<p t="2061629" d="4860">So there’s something that just seems to
be wrong, it just seems wrong, that conclusion.</p>
<p t="2066489" d="4820">And so, then one of the things you might ask
is okay, that doesn’t seem very good, what’s</p>
<p t="2071309" d="1201">the opposite of that?</p>
<p t="2072510" d="3589">So one of the things that I’ve really been
trying to figure out is, what is the opposite</p>
<p t="2076099" d="1810">of the path that leads to Auschwitz?</p>
<p t="2077909" d="2930">You know, once we can agree that that’s
a bad path.</p>
<p t="2080839" d="2170">Okay, fine, we’ve got a ‘bad’ identified.</p>
<p t="2083009" d="3310">That implies the reverse, a good path.</p>
<p t="2086319" d="1310">It doesn’t define it though, right?</p>
<p t="2087629" d="2050">It just implies it.</p>
<p t="2089679" d="6351">So the implication would be, whatever is least
likely to lead you there is de facto good.</p>
<p t="2096030" d="5269">Or at least you’ve basically identified
the territory.</p>
<p t="2101299" d="4891">And it seems to me that the opposite of not
caring about anyone, and wishing, perhaps,</p>
<p t="2106190" d="5960">for their painful destruction, is something
like caring for everyone and wishing for their</p>
<p t="2112150" d="2149">universal betterment.</p>
<p t="2114299" d="1141">Something like that.</p>
<p t="2115440" d="5129">And that seems to me to be associated with
the idea of improving being itself.</p>
<p t="2120569" d="5450">And that means yours and your family’s and
your community’s and as far out as you can</p>
<p t="2126019" d="5270">reach, probably starting with the local, you
know, till you get yourself all practiced.</p>
<p t="2131289" d="6761">And so, that seems to me to be an impossible
aim, in some sense, and that’s actually</p>
<p t="2138050" d="11150">a good thing, because the psychological consequences
of pursuing an impossibly good goal are that</p>
<p t="2149200" d="4379">everything you do seems to become meaningful,
because it’s related intelligibly to that</p>
<p t="2153579" d="6750">goal, and you have a structure within which
you can grapple with uncertainty.</p>
<p t="2160329" d="5020">You know, because if someone, even you, says
that well why do you bother with that?</p>
<p t="2165349" d="4210">You can say well, because of this and this
and this and this, and then it leads down</p>
<p t="2169559" d="4411">to Auschwitz, and we’re not going there,
and that’s why I’m doing this.</p>
<p t="2173970" d="4170">And that’s a hell of a tough argument to
argue yourself out of.</p>
<p t="2178140" d="5010">And you know, one of the things you really
need in life is an argument for life that</p>
<p t="2183150" d="2770">you cannot dispute.</p>
<p t="2185920" d="3370">You know, because otherwise you’re plagued,
like the existentialists would say, with this</p>
<p t="2189290" d="3319">constant recurrence of existential doubt.</p>
<p t="2192609" d="2321">And that paralyses and cripples you.</p>
<p t="2194930" d="1470">And it makes you weak.</p>
<p t="2196400" d="2520">And worse, you know.</p>
<p t="2198920" d="1579">It’s worse.</p>
<p t="2200499" d="5961">You can end up with so much self-contempt
just because of who you are as a creature,</p>
<p t="2206460" d="5780">that you’re unconsciously wishing for, you
know, absolute annihilation.</p>
<p t="2212240" d="5059">I see this in many, many places, but one of
the things I’ve seen…</p>
<p t="2217299" d="8790">most frequently probably in the last 30 years,
is the insistence, on the part of certain</p>
<p t="2226089" d="4321">parties who are at least in principle concerned
with environmental issues, that the planet</p>
<p t="2230410" d="2199">would be better off with no people on it.</p>
<p t="2232609" d="7781">It’s like, I think, well the first thing
I think is, well let’s start with you, but</p>
<p t="2240390" d="1220">the next thing I think is really?</p>
<p t="2241610" d="1959">That’s really what you think, eh?</p>
<p t="2243569" d="5760">It’s like you know, you don’t have to
go very far down, from a psychoanalytic perspective,</p>
<p t="2249329" d="5061">into the dream underlying a statement like
that, before you see that it is the sort of</p>
<p t="2254390" d="4570">dream that you do not want to have anything
to do with.</p>
<p t="2258960" d="2589">Because there’s an actively genocidal component
to it.</p>
<p t="2261549" d="2971">And it’s based in loathing of humanity.</p>
<p t="2264520" d="3940">Self-loathing, but also loathing of the entire
species.</p>
<p t="2268460" d="3490">It’s like, better beware of that sort of
thinking.</p>
<p t="2271950" d="5559">Which is not to say that we have some things
that we could clean up, you know, but a little</p>
<p t="2277509" d="2631">sympathy for humanity wouldn’t be a bad
thing.</p>
<p t="2280140" d="4419">We do have a relatively hard time of it, after
all, which is also something the existentialists…</p>
<p t="2284559" d="3921">you know, they’re a nice corrective to Freud,
because Freud says hey, you’re probably</p>
<p t="2288480" d="2729">healthy unless something terrible has happened
to you.</p>
<p t="2291209" d="4900">And the existentialists come along and say
yeah, but something terrible happens to everyone.</p>
<p t="2296109" d="4680">So you know, existence itself is sufficient
cause for human insanity.</p>
<p t="2300789" d="1841">And you know, I basically buy that.</p>
<p t="2302630" d="5729">I think everyone has an impossible existential
and moral burden.</p>
<p t="2308359" d="2781">It’s a condition of life.</p>
<p t="2311140" d="5379">And so, when you see a creature like that,
you think yeah, it’s no wonder you’re</p>
<p t="2316519" d="6210">cracked and maybe somewhat dangerous, but
man you’ve got the motivation for it, so,</p>
<p t="2322729" d="4790">you know, a little understanding might be
in order.</p>
<p t="2327519" d="4790">You know, when I see people who are agoraphobic,
they come to me and they say, well I’ve</p>
<p t="2332309" d="3030">become afraid of everything.</p>
<p t="2335339" d="1780">I think, yeah that’s easy to understand.</p>
<p t="2337119" d="3890">I just can’t figure out how the hell it
was any different than that.</p>
<p t="2341009" d="5090">How did you ever manage to not be afraid of
everything?</p>
<p t="2346099" d="1000">Because that’s the question.</p>
<p t="2347099" d="2831">And that’s the fundamental existential question
too.</p>
<p t="2349930" d="5679">When you’re surrounded by infinite vulnerability,
how the hell can you stay calm?</p>
<p t="2355609" d="4660">Well, you know, there’s a bunch of answers
to that, we’ve explored some of them.</p>
<p t="2360269" d="4320">Partly is, well you organise yourself with
everybody else so that the chaos is at least</p>
<p t="2364589" d="1341">held at bay.</p>
<p t="2365930" d="5020">You know, you’re not confronted at every
single second with the possibility of insanity</p>
<p t="2370950" d="2269">or disease or death.</p>
<p t="2373219" d="2671">You could put some distance between you and
that.</p>
<p t="2375890" d="5510">And that’s not an illusion, it’s like,
you know, you don’t want to spend the night</p>
<p t="2381400" d="4199">in a hospital room where an epidemic of Ebola
is raging.</p>
<p t="2385599" d="3270">And that’s not a psychological problem.</p>
<p t="2388869" d="3650">You just don’t want to be there, and intelligibly
so.</p>
<p t="2392519" d="4881">So even putting any distance between you and
that outcome isn’t illusory.</p>
<p t="2397400" d="4780">But then, you know, there’s the other things
that we do too, which is try to find meaningful</p>
<p t="2402180" d="4169">things within the confines of our own life.</p>
<p t="2406349" d="7700">And the destructive and nihilistic philosophies
basically always claim that that’s delusional.</p>
<p t="2414049" d="2520">And I don’t believe that, I think that’s
wrong.</p>
<p t="2416569" d="4111">And I think it’s dangerous, and I think
it’s almost everything that students are</p>
<p t="2420680" d="2139">now taught in universities.</p>
<p t="2422819" d="5540">And so, over the last ten years, it seems
to me to be, and maybe this is an overstatement…</p>
<p t="2428359" d="4870">but the university education in the humanities
and often the social sciences causes more</p>
<p t="2433229" d="2691">harm than it does good.</p>
<p t="2435920" d="4260">Because this is basically what it teaches
students, at a point in their life where instead</p>
<p t="2440180" d="5069">of confronting the radical uncertainty underneath
everything, is that, you know, you should</p>
<p t="2445249" d="8171">be invited into life, helped find a niche
that’s fulfilling from a human perspective,</p>
<p t="2453420" d="3899">master that, and then you know, maybe start
thinking about extending yourself a little</p>
<p t="2457319" d="2210">bit beyond that into the unknown.</p>
<p t="2459529" d="3780">But to take people who hardly know what the
hell they’re doing to begin with, and then</p>
<p t="2463309" d="9260">expose them to you know, post-modernist, ultra-rational
fundamental critique of everything, it’s</p>
<p t="2472569" d="3190">like, what do you expect is going to happen
when people have that experience?</p>
<p t="2475759" d="2610">Plus I think it’s wrong.</p>
<p t="2478369" d="1890">That’s the worst of it.</p>
<p t="2480259" d="4681">I don’t think it’s factually true, I don’t
think it’s philosophically true, and I think</p>
<p t="2484940" d="1000">it’s dangerous.</p>
<p t="2485940" d="1899">That’s a bad combination.</p>
<p t="2487839" d="4510">And, you know, part of the reason I think
that people do this, and are such admirers</p>
<p t="2492349" d="6150">of post-modern nihilism, is that it abdicates
the necessity of responsibility.</p>
<p t="2498499" d="2191">You know, because people say, well I’m just
thinking it through.</p>
<p t="2500690" d="3500">It’s like, you’re never just thinking
something through.</p>
<p t="2504190" d="4409">The probability that motivation has nothing
to do with that is zero.</p>
<p t="2508599" d="3740">Because we already know, just from the things
we covered in this class, that motivation</p>
<p t="2512339" d="2510">frames your perceptions, you know.</p>
<p t="2514849" d="3470">You can’t even see the damn gorilla when
you’re counting the basketballs.</p>
<p t="2518319" d="6500">And so, you know, if you’re forming a rationalistic
critique of everything, and then you say,</p>
<p t="2524819" d="3980">oh well, I’m not motivated, it’s like,
well you’re motivated when you count the</p>
<p t="2528799" d="3641">basketballs, and so the probability that you’re
motivated when you’re doing something far</p>
<p t="2532440" d="4779">more extensive and difficult than that is
100%.</p>
<p t="2537219" d="7661">You know Jung would say, you know, this is
when we get back to the mythological underpinnings</p>
<p t="2544880" d="14810">of things as well… in the Egyptian myth
of creation and reality, Osiris is the figure</p>
<p t="2559690" d="1879">of tradition.</p>
<p t="2561569" d="6230">So he sort of represents the dominance hierarchy,
roughly speaking, in all of its manifestations.</p>
<p t="2567799" d="2012">And he has an evil brother named Set.</p>
<p t="2569811" d="3688">Set is a typical figure in fairy tales.</p>
<p t="2573499" d="6681">You know, in The Lion King you see Scar, who’s
exactly the same figure, and the Scar/Set</p>
<p t="2580180" d="6519">figure stands for the proclivity of bureaucracies
to degenerate into malevolent totalitarian</p>
<p t="2586699" d="5761">states, which is always a problem, right,
because they rigidify and then oppress.</p>
<p t="2592460" d="4859">That’s the price you pay for existing within
a hierarchy.</p>
<p t="2597319" d="4040">And then they rigidify and oppress sometimes
because that’s just what happens as they</p>
<p t="2601359" d="1000">age.</p>
<p t="2602359" d="6250">And sometimes because there’s a voice recommending
that as a mode of being.</p>
<p t="2608609" d="4881">“It’s okay if you do this, it’s okay
if you break this rule, what the hell difference</p>
<p t="2613490" d="2239">does it make anyways?”</p>
<p t="2615729" d="4251">You see some of that being played out right
now with the revelation of all those Panama</p>
<p t="2619980" d="1000">papers, right?</p>
<p t="2620980" d="7869">Which is a huge revelation of corruption (hardly
surprising) at high levels of power all around</p>
<p t="2628849" d="1041">the world.</p>
<p t="2629890" d="8649">Now I see the… you know, at the bottom of
everything, so this is the archetypal depths,</p>
<p t="2638539" d="9270">I see this battle in the human soul, basically,
between an attitude that says “despite its</p>
<p t="2647809" d="4430">limitations, life is valuable and worth preserving
and improving”.</p>
<p t="2652239" d="1790">That’s proposition 1.</p>
<p t="2654029" d="6530">And the other proposition is: “the suffering
that life involves renders it ethically untenable</p>
<p t="2660559" d="6331">and physiologically and psychologically unbearable,
and as a consequence of that, it should just</p>
<p t="2666890" d="1000">be eradicated”.</p>
<p t="2667890" d="2389">And so it’s a binary choice, in some sense.</p>
<p t="2670279" d="2490">Yes to being, or no?</p>
<p t="2672769" d="5030">And you know, you can conjure up powerful
arguments on both sides of that.</p>
<p t="2677799" d="7070">But to some degree, your whole being is an
argument between those two questions.</p>
<p t="2684869" d="4460">You know, and one of the things that Jung
said, which I think is extremely worthwhile,</p>
<p t="2689329" d="6211">is that you should figure out what archetypal
forces are in charge of your being.</p>
<p t="2695540" d="1709">Because they’re there whether you know it
or not.</p>
<p t="2697249" d="2580">Now, you know, we’ve walked through that
in some detail.</p>
<p t="2699829" d="5490">You can look at it… in a sense, from a biological
perspective, it’s more mechanistic.</p>
<p t="2705319" d="7430">You know, you’re a tool of hunger and anger
and fear and love, and lust and all those</p>
<p t="2712749" d="7610">primordial forces that make up your field
of experience.</p>
<p t="2720359" d="3440">That’s a purely biological way of thinking
about it.</p>
<p t="2723799" d="4000">A more archetypal way of thinking about it
is that those things are actually characters,</p>
<p t="2727799" d="1181">or personalities.</p>
<p t="2728980" d="5549">And they’re organised into hierarchies that
are also characters and personalities.</p>
<p t="2734529" d="7700">And anger and fear and resentment and hatred
and the carnivorous soul of human beings and</p>
<p t="2742229" d="4140">all of those things aggregate into one form
of meta-personality.</p>
<p t="2746369" d="5650">And all the things that you might think about
as existing in opposition to that aggregate</p>
<p t="2752019" d="1401">into another.</p>
<p t="2753420" d="4960">And then the top-most struggle for integration
is the struggle between those two things.</p>
<p t="2758380" d="2739">That’s a very common mythological theme.</p>
<p t="2761119" d="3840">That’s basically the battle between good
and evil in heaven.</p>
<p t="2764959" d="7030">And that’s an unbelievably old… it’s
as old an idea as human beings have.</p>
<p t="2771989" d="3320">You know, the battle of the gods for dominance
in heaven.</p>
<p t="2775309" d="3621">Even if it’s not strictly between good and
evil, even if it hasn’t been developed to</p>
<p t="2778930" d="5720">the point of that ultimate opposition, it’s
still a battle, at some level, between titanic</p>
<p t="2784650" d="1929">forces for domination.</p>
<p t="2786579" d="7160">Well, that’s partly a description of your
own psyche, and partly a description of the</p>
<p t="2793739" d="3470">organisation, or lack thereof, of societies
across time.</p>
<p t="2797209" d="8660">Well, and it seems to me that… one of the
things that Jung was insistent upon, because</p>
<p t="2805869" d="8910">he was trying to… and many of the thinkers
that we’ve covered in this series, they</p>
<p t="2814779" d="4502">were trying to answer the question (this was
especially true for the clinicians) of how</p>
<p t="2819281" d="5899">it is that an individual should conduct themselves
so that their mode of being is optimised.</p>
<p t="2825180" d="5939">You can say well that’s mental health, but
that’s a radically insufficient way of describing</p>
<p t="2831119" d="5840">that, because, well it’s not merely the
absence of pathology, it’s something much</p>
<p t="2836959" d="1000">more complex.</p>
<p t="2837959" d="3701">It’s something active and it’s not even
individual, it’s individual and social.</p>
<p t="2841660" d="3470">You know, because you’re not going to be
mentally healthy unless you’re integrated</p>
<p t="2845130" d="2239">into a functioning social community.</p>
<p t="2847369" d="1200">You just can’t do it.</p>
<p t="2848569" d="2131">Because other people are part of what keeps
you safe.</p>
<p t="2850700" d="2909">Because they’re always wacking you when
you get out of line a little bit.</p>
<p t="2853609" d="4720">They just tap you with sarcasm or raised eyebrows
or frowns or smiles.</p>
<p t="2858329" d="5701">They’re constantly tapping you into being
a proper person, whatever the hell that is.</p>
<p t="2864030" d="3179">But they’re telling you all the time what
it is.</p>
<p t="2867209" d="13790">So Nietzsche’s idea was that the modern
world had landed itself in hot water, because</p>
<p t="2880999" d="7570">its own proclivity for searching out the truth
had undermined its faith in traditional axioms</p>
<p t="2888569" d="1000">of morality.</p>
<p t="2889569" d="1000">Fair enough.</p>
<p t="2890569" d="2591">That seems about right.</p>
<p t="2893160" d="7389">And his cure for that was that people became,
he called it ‘overmen’, often translated</p>
<p t="2900549" d="6000">as supermen, which were people who created
their own values to fill the void left by</p>
<p t="2906549" d="1750">the absence of traditional values.</p>
<p t="2908299" d="2841">But there’s a bunch of problems with that
idea.</p>
<p t="2911140" d="4399">One is individuals probably can’t do it
because they don’t live long enough, and</p>
<p t="2915539" d="1330">second, it’s really hard.</p>
<p t="2916869" d="4370">I mean, just from the perspective of “what
are you going to be, the best philosopher</p>
<p t="2921239" d="2320">who ever lived?” because that’s really
what it requires.</p>
<p t="2923559" d="5651">And then the third problem is, what makes
you think you create values?</p>
<p t="2929210" d="2809">Like it isn’t phenomenologically obvious
that you do.</p>
<p t="2932019" d="4381">It’s more like you experience them, and
sometimes you don’t even know where they</p>
<p t="2936400" d="1000">come from.</p>
<p t="2937400" d="1000">You get angry.</p>
<p t="2938400" d="1280">Do you know why?</p>
<p t="2939680" d="2909">Maybe you’ll have to think about it for
like three days.</p>
<p t="2942589" d="6460">So in what way you created that is, well,
it’s not self-evident.</p>
<p t="2949049" d="6581">And Jung’s idea was well, the forces that
we had regarded as traditional sources of</p>
<p t="2955630" d="4650">values were actually spontaneous constructions
of the human psyche.</p>
<p t="2960280" d="2989">They weren’t arbitrary systems of rules.</p>
<p t="2963269" d="2170">They were way deeper than that.</p>
<p t="2965439" d="6910">And I think, if you have an ounce of biologist
in you, you immediately read that and think,</p>
<p t="2972349" d="1980">yeah obviously.</p>
<p t="2974329" d="1000">Obviously.</p>
<p t="2975329" d="5031">Even the social rules that govern a dominance
hierarchy, they’re instilled in you.</p>
<p t="2980360" d="1000">You know them.</p>
<p t="2981360" d="1290">They’re right in your body.</p>
<p t="2982650" d="4639">And so there’s a biological basis for your
understanding of culture right at that level.</p>
<p t="2987289" d="1570">That’s damn near spinal.</p>
<p t="2988859" d="2090">Like it’s old.</p>
<p t="2990949" d="6310">So Jung’s secondary proposition, and this
is quite an interesting one, was that by attending</p>
<p t="2997259" d="6040">to your fantasies and your dreams, and your
daydreams, for that matter, you can come into</p>
<p t="3003299" d="4930">contact with some of the primordial psychic
forces that originally produced religious</p>
<p t="3008229" d="1740">revelation.</p>
<p t="3009969" d="3191">So that you can find what’s lost by looking
within.</p>
<p t="3013160" d="3629">And that’s basically the entire point of
Jungian psychotherapy.</p>
<p t="3016789" d="7351">And part of the reason I’m concentrating
on Jung is because guys like Rogers, you know,</p>
<p t="3024140" d="5979">and the phenomenologists, they’re moving
down the same trail of thought, but they didn’t</p>
<p t="3030119" d="1930">get as far as Jung as far as I can tell.</p>
<p t="3032049" d="3060">Like, they never took it to its ultimate conclusion.</p>
<p t="3035109" d="6031">You know Maslow, for example, talked about
a hierarchy of needs, and the self-actualised</p>
<p t="3041140" d="6880">person was someone who had accomplished all
those basic needs and popped out at the top.</p>
<p t="3048020" d="4029">It’s like, kind of true, but sort of primitive.</p>
<p t="3052049" d="4810">Because it is by no means obvious that you
have to take care of all your basic material</p>
<p t="3056859" d="2390">needs before you can act morally.</p>
<p t="3059249" d="2201">It’s a foolish idea.</p>
<p t="3061450" d="5309">It assumes that people are going to become
more moral as they get richer.</p>
<p t="3066759" d="4220">Now, I’m not saying that they become less
moral, because I don’t believe that, but</p>
<p t="3070979" d="2300">I don’t see that there’s any positive
association.</p>
<p t="3073279" d="5111">It’s just that you can use your wealth well
or you can use it badly.</p>
<p t="3078390" d="4569">Just like you can use your poverty well or
you can use it badly.</p>
<p t="3082959" d="4520">So Maslow, it’s like yeah, there’s a hierarchy,
yes something emerges at the top, no it’s</p>
<p t="3087479" d="3870">not a consequence of the fulfillment of needs,
it’s way too materialistic, it’s basically</p>
<p t="3091349" d="3690">like a utopian socialist idea, right.</p>
<p t="3095039" d="3470">If you feed people enough cake, all of a sudden
everyone will get along.</p>
<p t="3098509" d="2641">It’s like, people aren’t like that at
all.</p>
<p t="3101150" d="6020">So Jung took this idea of personal development,
as far as I can tell, to its ultimate extreme,</p>
<p t="3107170" d="1559">to its logical conclusion.</p>
<p t="3108729" d="4000">And that where he ran into the archetypes,
because what archetypes are, in some sense,</p>
<p t="3112729" d="2800">is the ultimate instantiation of an idea.</p>
<p t="3115529" d="1691">You can’t go beyond it.</p>
<p t="3117220" d="1730">That’s why it’s an archetype.</p>
<p t="3118950" d="2240">So there’s an archetype of death.</p>
<p t="3121190" d="1139">Well, why?</p>
<p t="3122329" d="2870">Because you can’t go past that.</p>
<p t="3125199" d="2731">Words fail when you’re confronted by that.</p>
<p t="3127930" d="4250">And there’s an archetype of love, and there’s
an archetype of evil, and all those things</p>
<p t="3132180" d="6850">are beyond articulation in their archetypal
form.</p>
<p t="3139030" d="5430">And they’re the place where your articulated
thought ceases to be relevant.</p>
<p t="3144460" d="9479">So, for Jung, you know, the self-development
route was the confrontation of those things</p>
<p t="3153939" d="2211">that you had abandoned within.</p>
<p t="3156150" d="5399">Now, I’ve been thinking about Jung for a
very long time.</p>
<p t="3161549" d="4560">And I think that one of the things that struck
me about the psychoanalysts is that they’re</p>
<p t="3166109" d="7621">much too concerned about the idea that if
you’re properly organised as a human being,</p>
<p t="3173730" d="7489">that organisation is intra-psychic, like it’s
in you somehow.</p>
<p t="3181219" d="2951">So for Jung, the hero’s journey was a journey
into the unconscious.</p>
<p t="3184170" d="3419">An individual journey into the unconscious.</p>
<p t="3187589" d="5351">Now he started to see flaws in that idea as
he moved forward with his thinking, but one</p>
<p t="3192940" d="6139">of the flaws in that idea is that you’re
not only individual, not at all.</p>
<p t="3199079" d="7111">And if you’re situated properly, we’ll
say in being, your familial relationships</p>
<p t="3206190" d="6919">are healthy, as well as the proper balance
being struck inside you, between the competing</p>
<p t="3213109" d="2031">sub-personalities that make you up.</p>
<p t="3215140" d="2679">And those things are actually not different,
you know what I mean?</p>
<p t="3217819" d="2450">You can’t have one without the other.</p>
<p t="3220269" d="6161">So to think about them even as separate spheres
is improper in a sense, because you’re limited</p>
<p t="3226430" d="5970">in your well-being by the well-being of those
people who are in concentric circles around</p>
<p t="3232400" d="1189">you.</p>
<p t="3233589" d="5041">And no matter how well-organised you are internally,
it’s insufficient.</p>
<p t="3238630" d="4270">You know, you see that reflected in stories
like the story of the Buddha.</p>
<p t="3242900" d="6260">Because at one point, the Buddha, after being
walloped by knowledge of old age and sickness</p>
<p t="3249160" d="5080">and death, because that’s really what does
him in, he attains enlightenment under a tree</p>
<p t="3254240" d="2839">(for a variety of reasons we won’t go into).</p>
<p t="3257079" d="5130">So he’s attained a perfect state of primarily
subjective being.</p>
<p t="3262209" d="4790">And that’s sort of like, it’s a temptation,
there’s a temptation to remain there.</p>
<p t="3266999" d="3391">But he shuts that down and then goes back
into the world and teaches people, because</p>
<p t="3270390" d="5589">his realisation is, Nirvana attained individually
is not true Nirvana.</p>
<p t="3275979" d="2941">You can’t be not suffering in a sea of suffering.</p>
<p t="3278920" d="4109">You know, all that means is that you’ve
got a particular kind of blinder on.</p>
<p t="3283029" d="6300">So he goes back, so to speak, and then suffers,
mythologically speaking, suffers a normal,</p>
<p t="3289329" d="1000">human death.</p>
<p t="3290329" d="12280">And in some sense that’s portrayed as voluntary.</p>
<p t="3302609" d="3090">Sometimes I show people Pinocchio in this
class, I think we did a little bit of that…</p>
<p t="3305699" d="2080">did we do a little bit of that?</p>
<p t="3307779" d="6270">Well, you know, in Pinocchio, Pinocchio’s
trying to become a real person.</p>
<p t="3314049" d="5270">And he has to do a variety of very strange
things to manage that, one of which is to</p>
<p t="3319319" d="6571">go down into the depths of the ocean and confront
the most frightening thing, roughly speaking,</p>
<p t="3325890" d="3059">and simultaneously rescue his father.</p>
<p t="3328949" d="2431">Which is a very, very strange set of ideas,
you know.</p>
<p t="3331380" d="3800">It’s definitely a descent into the Underworld,
there’s elements of Jonah and the Whale</p>
<p t="3335180" d="3470">in there, which is a very, very old story.</p>
<p t="3338650" d="5289">But there’s an idea that’s very much associated
with Jungian thinking too, and that is that</p>
<p t="3343939" d="5030">in the background chaos of your mind, there
are depths.</p>
<p t="3348969" d="8431">And in those depths are the forgotten or non-articulate
structures of your culture, but more than</p>
<p t="3357400" d="6969">that, the forgotten or non-articulate parts
of your psyche that would make it a culture-creating</p>
<p t="3364369" d="2061">entity.</p>
<p t="3366430" d="7760">And that that has to be discovered in order
for you to have the courage to be an individual.</p>
<p t="3374190" d="5739">And there’s nothing delusional about that,
you know, because the idea there, as opposed</p>
<p t="3379929" d="7340">to say, the typical nihilistic or terror-management
theories, is that if you got your act together,</p>
<p t="3387269" d="4171">the fear of death would no longer be the thing
that fundamentally rules you.</p>
<p t="3391440" d="1509">Like that that’s actually possible.</p>
<p t="3392949" d="5760">So there’s a weird idea there, and the idea
is not that fear of vulnerability and death</p>
<p t="3398709" d="7491">is irrelevant, or not even that it’s not
central, but that people are so God-damn tough,</p>
<p t="3406200" d="4899">that it’s possible that they can face that
directly and say: “that’s not going to</p>
<p t="3411099" d="1821">be what rules my life”.</p>
<p t="3412920" d="1480">And I believe people can do that.</p>
<p t="3414400" d="2829">I’ve seen people do that, certainly, in
their careers.</p>
<p t="3417229" d="3921">You know, even if they can’t articulate
that philosophy, you put them in a situation</p>
<p t="3421150" d="4669">where they’re dealing with nothing but death
and destruction, and, you know, they can do</p>
<p t="3425819" d="2351">it, which is mind-boggling.</p>
<p t="3428170" d="1819">And a great thing to be able to see.</p>
<p t="3429989" d="5310">And it’s… you know, you search in vain
throughout the annals of psychology for optimistic</p>
<p t="3435299" d="1351">ideas.</p>
<p t="3436650" d="4419">And I think that’s particularly true with
regards to, like, the more experimental brands</p>
<p t="3441069" d="4500">of psychology that are associated with being,
like social psychology.</p>
<p t="3445569" d="3000">Personality we’ll leave out of this for
the time-being, because it’s become more</p>
<p t="3448569" d="2071">statistical, you know.</p>
<p t="3450640" d="7129">But the idea that there is enough in you,
so that if you don’t flinch from life, you</p>
<p t="3457769" d="3550">can become strong enough to master it, that’s
an amazing idea.</p>
<p t="3461319" d="4290">It’s the only optimistic idea that I’ve
ever seen that’s profound that I actually</p>
<p t="3465609" d="1000">believe.</p>
<p t="3466609" d="3960">Because of most of the profound ideas that
are easy to believe are terrible ideas.</p>
<p t="3470569" d="5210">You know, they have to do with the inevitability
of malevolence and death and insanity and</p>
<p t="3475779" d="4430">suffering and all of that, you know, those
things trying to blow through your persona.</p>
<p t="3480209" d="5311">But trying to find something optimistic to
counter-balance that, that’s tough.</p>
<p t="3485520" d="4380">But you know, the other thing we know about
people now that we didn’t know a few years</p>
<p t="3489900" d="12629">ago, is that if you put yourself in new environments
you actually change yourself genetically.</p>
<p t="3502529" d="6460">You know, so if I take you out of your safe
environment and start you to expose you, say,</p>
<p t="3508989" d="5060">to situations that you fear, you could say
that one of the reasons that you transform</p>
<p t="3514049" d="4670">is because you observe yourself mastering
those situations.</p>
<p t="3518719" d="5060">So you get bigger, so to speak, and the situations
get smaller.</p>
<p t="3523779" d="1000">Lovely.</p>
<p t="3524779" d="2940">You can account for that by learning.</p>
<p t="3527719" d="4490">But there’s an additional dimension that
might be related to the learning, which is</p>
<p t="3532209" d="6310">that if you put yourself in a new situation,
then different proteins start to be encoded</p>
<p t="3538519" d="2580">in your brain and in the rest of your nervous
system.</p>
<p t="3541099" d="3111">So you actually transmute, literally speaking.</p>
<p t="3544210" d="5490">And the total range of human transmutation
is unexplored.</p>
<p t="3549700" d="17789">So there’s this idea, let me show you, this
is a cool thing to know about.</p>
<p t="3567489" d="18370">Okay so that’s a picture of a labyrinth
in the Chartres Cathedral.</p>
<p t="3585859" d="4900">Now a cathedral is shaped like a cross.</p>
<p t="3590759" d="5820">And then the focal point of the cathedral
is right at the middle of the cross.</p>
<p t="3596579" d="5111">And the cross is an X, so to speak, and the
centre of the X is where you are.</p>
<p t="3601690" d="5779">And the reason it’s a cross is because the
centre of that X is suffering.</p>
<p t="3607469" d="6181">And so the central aspect of consciousness
of being is integrally associated with suffering,</p>
<p t="3613650" d="1289">betrayal, all of those things.</p>
<p t="3614939" d="2971">That’s the nature of the centre of the world.</p>
<p t="3617910" d="3020">And so then the question might be, well how
do you cope with that?</p>
<p t="3620930" d="5549">Well, the typical religious idea is that you
identify with a hero figure of some sort,</p>
<p t="3626479" d="5460">although that’s often warped and morphed
into the idea that you believe in them.</p>
<p t="3631939" d="2070">It’s not the right idea.</p>
<p t="3634009" d="2850">The right idea is that you identify with them.</p>
<p t="3636859" d="4420">So I can give you an example of that from
the Christian mass ceremony, which is actually</p>
<p t="3641279" d="2391">a cannibalistic ritual.</p>
<p t="3643670" d="1830">And it’s a very, very old idea.</p>
<p t="3645500" d="3989">And the idea is that you become what you ingest,
right.</p>
<p t="3649489" d="4770">And so, it’s… the mass ceremony, which
is in principle the eating of the flesh of</p>
<p t="3654259" d="5921">a God, is not a ritual to instantiate articulated
belief.</p>
<p t="3660180" d="3730">It’s a ritual to instantiate embodied transformation.</p>
<p t="3663910" d="3490">You’re supposed to become what that represents.</p>
<p t="3667400" d="1830">Question is, what the hell does it represent?</p>
<p t="3669230" d="1539">Well we know some of that.</p>
<p t="3670769" d="2500">It represents, for example, the ability to
pay attention.</p>
<p t="3673269" d="2590">That’s one thing that for sure it represents.</p>
<p t="3675859" d="5611">Because, you know, Christ is an analogue of
Horus, a very tight analogue of Horus, as</p>
<p t="3681470" d="1359">a matter of fact.</p>
<p t="3682829" d="2611">So… but what else does it represent?</p>
<p t="3685440" d="2539">Well I can give you some suggestions.</p>
<p t="3687979" d="6521">One of the things that is often required of
the believer in a traditional religion is</p>
<p t="3694500" d="1359">a pilgrimage.</p>
<p t="3695859" d="4870">Now, that was quite common in Christianity
in the Middle Ages, that’s kind of disappeared.</p>
<p t="3700729" d="2921">You see bits and pieces of it in Judaism,
modern Judaism in particular, with the idea</p>
<p t="3703650" d="5799">that, you know, every North American Jew,
for example, should go to Israel at least</p>
<p t="3709449" d="1620">once.</p>
<p t="3711069" d="5440">And then of course it’s a massively featured
element of traditional Islam.</p>
<p t="3716509" d="2360">So you think, well what does a pilgrimage
do to someone?</p>
<p t="3718869" d="3720">Well partly it’s a journey to the holy city,
whatever that means.</p>
<p t="3722589" d="4840">The holy city is a symbolic representation
of an ideal mode of being.</p>
<p t="3727429" d="3961">So you’re making a symbolic journey to an
ideal mode of being.</p>
<p t="3731390" d="3889">Okay well let’s say you’re some ratty
villager from somewhere and you’ve never</p>
<p t="3735279" d="4790">been more than a mile away from you’re village
and you’re functionally illiterate and you</p>
<p t="3740069" d="1160">don’t know anything about the world.</p>
<p t="3741229" d="5320">And one day you decide to take that 1500 or
3000 mile pilgrimage.</p>
<p t="3746549" d="3810">The probability that you’re going to be
the same person when you come back as you</p>
<p t="3750359" d="2551">were when you left is zero.</p>
<p t="3752910" d="3189">And the reason for that is, well a lot of
things are going to happen to you along the</p>
<p t="3756099" d="1000">way.</p>
<p t="3757099" d="1000">God only knows.</p>
<p t="3758099" d="1061">It’s going to be a big adventure.</p>
<p t="3759160" d="1840">And you might say, well what’s the utility
in that?</p>
<p t="3761000" d="9019">And the utility is that with each stressful
situation you encounter, and master, your</p>
<p t="3770019" d="1611">capacity grows.</p>
<p t="3771630" d="5569">And so maybe you’ll encounter five hundred
of those on your pilgrimage.</p>
<p t="3777199" d="4170">Maybe it’s dangerous enough so there’s
a reasonable probability that you won’t</p>
<p t="3781369" d="1581">even come back alive.</p>
<p t="3782950" d="1889">But if you do come back, you’re not naïve.</p>
<p t="3784839" d="1750">You’ve seen the world.</p>
<p t="3786589" d="3640">You’re going to be someone who’s much
more difficult to contend with.</p>
<p t="3790229" d="3110">And you’re going to be a bit of a foreigner
to the people in your village.</p>
<p t="3793339" d="1650">That’s the price you pay for that.</p>
<p t="3794989" d="7911">Remember in The Hobbit when Bilbo goes out
to confront the dragon and then he comes back,</p>
<p t="3802900" d="1330">no one really likes him anymore.</p>
<p t="3804230" d="4209">Like they respect him, but they think, well,
here’s this weird guy that transformed himself</p>
<p t="3808439" d="3580">into a thief, and then went and confronted
a dragon.</p>
<p t="3812019" d="4230">He went way the hell away from his home, so
he’s sort of contaminated by the foreigner,</p>
<p t="3816249" d="1000">and he made it back.</p>
<p t="3817249" d="1450">You don’t want to mess with him.</p>
<p t="3818699" d="4120">But he’s not the same thing that he was
when he was there.</p>
<p t="3822819" d="2510">And that’s all to the good.</p>
<p t="3825329" d="5010">I mean, what happens in the next series of
books makes it quite evident that if Bilbo</p>
<p t="3830339" d="4750">hadn’t undergone his adventure, then the
battle between good and evil would have gone</p>
<p t="3835089" d="1371">to the evil side.</p>
<p t="3836460" d="2969">That’s the entire plot of The Lord of the
Rings.</p>
<p t="3839429" d="3330">It’s this massive fantasy of good versus
evil.</p>
<p t="3842759" d="1580">Just like Harry Potter.</p>
<p t="3844339" d="3311">And those ideas never go away.</p>
<p t="3847650" d="3379">You see that with The Avengers too.</p>
<p t="3851029" d="4520">In the… one of the scenes in there is extremely
interesting.</p>
<p t="3855549" d="5430">So there’s this scene where… what do they
call those foreign aliens?</p>
<p t="3860979" d="2560">Is it Katari or something like that?</p>
<p t="3863539" d="4161">You know, the big monsters that come through
the portal and invade New York?</p>
<p t="3867700" d="1759">Anyways I don’t remember what they’re
called.</p>
<p t="3869459" d="7260">But there’s a very interesting scene in
there where the armed forces send a hydrogen</p>
<p t="3876719" d="4800">bomb to take New York out because of the descent
of these terrible aliens.</p>
<p t="3881519" d="5550">And Iron Man, who’s this weird android-like
thing (so he’s a human being that’s transforming</p>
<p t="3887069" d="3831">himself to something that’s more than a
human being… one of the things that happens</p>
<p t="3890900" d="5159">with Iron Man is that his suit gets increasingly
gold as the series continues, there’s a</p>
<p t="3896059" d="5760">real reason for that), he makes a personal
sacrifice to avert the hydrogen bomb, and</p>
<p t="3901819" d="3370">then it blows up all the bad guys and then
he falls to Earth, just like Icarus.</p>
<p t="3905189" d="1900">That’s pretty cool.</p>
<p t="3907089" d="6430">And then, what’s really interesting is that
when he falls to Earth and he’s dead, it’s</p>
<p t="3913519" d="2230">The Hulk who wakes him up.</p>
<p t="3915749" d="6110">And the reason for that is that The Hulk represents
masculine energy that’s completely unbound.</p>
<p t="3921859" d="5370">And then Tony Stark is sort of this tightly
constrained intellect character who’s half-machine…</p>
<p t="3927229" d="4320">he’s not enough savage, that’s one way
of looking at it, and so when he’s lying</p>
<p t="3931549" d="1550">there half-dead he’s missing something.</p>
<p t="3933099" d="3140">And so The Hulk comes along and yells him
into being again.</p>
<p t="3936239" d="3490">And he’s already made a relationship with
The Hulk.</p>
<p t="3939729" d="5570">And these things are genuine myths because
they’re co-created with their audience,</p>
<p t="3945299" d="1000">you know.</p>
<p t="3946299" d="1800">All of these stories have a back-story.</p>
<p t="3948099" d="4200">And if you’re a comic book writer and you
deviate improperly from the back-story then</p>
<p t="3952299" d="3490">you’re going to get like ten thousand letters
from fans saying “well what about issue</p>
<p t="3955789" d="2410">#118 on page 13?</p>
<p t="3958199" d="4340">That’s part of the necessary plot.”</p>
<p t="3962539" d="10280">Well, alright, keep Tony Stark in mind for
a minute.</p>
<p t="3972819" d="4110">Now, you see this labyrinth here, so I’ll
tell you what you do in the Chartres Cathedral.</p>
<p t="3976929" d="3830">So you’ve got this cross, and then this
thing is at the point of it.</p>
<p t="3980759" d="5381">Now, if you go on a pilgrimage, you go out
there and expand your personality by visiting</p>
<p t="3986140" d="3250">the North part of the world and the West part
of the world and the East part of the world</p>
<p t="3989390" d="1070">and the South part of the world.</p>
<p t="3990460" d="1000">You go everywhere.</p>
<p t="3991460" d="3369">You’re a wanderer that’s gone everywhere.</p>
<p t="3994829" d="4340">But maybe you can’t go to the damn pilgrimage
for one reason or another, so you do a symbolic</p>
<p t="3999169" d="1000">pilgrimage.</p>
<p t="4000169" d="3461">You go to the cathedral, and you go to the
point of suffering, so to speak, and then</p>
<p t="4003630" d="6299">you enter this maze, and to get to the middle
of the maze, which is very much like the flower</p>
<p t="4009929" d="2580">that the Buddha sits in, because it’s a
flower.</p>
<p t="4012509" d="3700">To get to the middle, you can’t just walk
straight to the middle.</p>
<p t="4016209" d="6290">You have to wander the entire maze and cover
every square foot of it.</p>
<p t="4022499" d="4550">And only once you’ve done that (so that’s
a symbolic journey to North, East, West, and</p>
<p t="4027049" d="3280">South), only after you’ve done that do you
get to the middle.</p>
<p t="4030329" d="4420">And the middle signifies the point where the
suffering that’s represented by the entire</p>
<p t="4034749" d="5320">structure of that building can be withstood.</p>
<p t="4040069" d="4591">And you know, you’ve got to understand,
this idea is so… you think about what those</p>
<p t="4044660" d="3859">damn Europeans were doing when they were building
those cathedrals.</p>
<p t="4048519" d="3691">You know, some of those things took five hundred
years to build.</p>
<p t="4052210" d="4369">You can’t even imagine a modern society
building something that would take five hundred</p>
<p t="4056579" d="1611">years to build.</p>
<p t="4058190" d="3399">It’s unimaginable to us.</p>
<p t="4061589" d="6430">And these cathedrals were so expensive, they
were like the trip to the moon in the 1960s.</p>
<p t="4068019" d="6660">The whole damn culture was devoted to producing
these fantastic structures of stone and light</p>
<p t="4074679" d="2740">that had this particular message embodied
in them.</p>
<p t="4077419" d="2000">It’s like, why were they doing that?</p>
<p t="4079419" d="4060">Well, you know, you can get cynical about
it, although I think that would be a little</p>
<p t="4083479" d="3090">premature, but this is part of the answer.</p>
<p t="4086569" d="3700">It’s like, the culture was trying to figure
something out.</p>
<p t="4090269" d="3230">And what they were trying to figure out was
where you should be.</p>
<p t="4093499" d="2530">And how you should get there.</p>
<p t="4096029" d="6071">And to point out as well how massive the consequences
were of failure versus success.</p>
<p t="4102100" d="2459">Because failure, that leads to hell.</p>
<p t="4104559" d="1611">And success, that leads to heaven.</p>
<p t="4106170" d="4560">And you know, you can think about that as
something projected into the future life,</p>
<p t="4110730" d="3710">which Nietzsche called ‘the biggest error
Christianity ever made’.</p>
<p t="4114440" d="6520">But if you dispense with that, at least provisionally,
the reality of that becomes clear right away.</p>
<p t="4120960" d="3140">What happens if you don’t take the voyage?</p>
<p t="4124100" d="2570">Well you become corrupt, because you’re
weak.</p>
<p t="4126670" d="1799">It’s as simple as that.</p>
<p t="4128469" d="2710">And you have every reason to become corrupt.</p>
<p t="4131179" d="5180">Like you could say the conditions of existence
are such that if you cannot tolerate them,</p>
<p t="4136359" d="2940">you will become corrupt.</p>
<p t="4139299" d="9770">And I just can’t see, in any way, how that’s
not self-evidently true.</p>
<p t="4149069" d="5250">And so, if you don’t take the voyage, well
what happens is everything tilts towards hell</p>
<p t="4154319" d="3010">around you, but you have a lot more influence
than you think.</p>
<p t="4157329" d="5510">So you don’t know exactly what waves of
causality are emanating from your decisions.</p>
<p t="4162839" d="2351">You have no idea.</p>
<p t="4165190" d="6169">And then if you do decide to go everywhere
and to pick up your responsibility, then what</p>
<p t="4171359" d="6061">emanates from you, maybe in receding waves,
is the idea that it’s possible to live life</p>
<p t="4177420" d="3379">properly and to make things better.</p>
<p t="4180799" d="7290">And that’s an idea… like I think that
idea is more powerful than death.</p>
<p t="4188089" d="2730">And it would be really good if that was the
case.</p>
<p t="4190819" d="4271">You know, the existential element comes in,
and I guess this is also the element of faith,</p>
<p t="4195090" d="2850">is that the only way you’re ever going to
figure that out is if you try it.</p>
<p t="4197940" d="6940">Because no one else can demonstrate the truth
or falsity of those two branching pathways</p>
<p t="4204880" d="4080">except you, because you have to test it in
the conditions of your own life.</p>
<p t="4208960" d="6810">And at some point… by the time you hit about
30, nobody can tell you what to do.</p>
<p t="4215770" d="1159">And you think, well, hooray.</p>
<p t="4216929" d="3130">It’s like, let’s go a little easy on the
celebrating.</p>
<p t="4220059" d="3781">You know, it’s quite a relief when you have
a problem and you go to someone and they say,</p>
<p t="4223840" d="1770">well here’s what you can do about it.</p>
<p t="4225610" d="6489">But by the time you’re fully adult, your
damn life is so individualised that, you know,</p>
<p t="4232099" d="7411">you could use moral guidelines and you should,
for sure, but you’re basically stuck with</p>
<p t="4239510" d="3470">the choices.</p>
<p t="4242980" d="6630">All these old ideas, they suggest that if
your choice is to voluntarily confront and</p>
<p t="4249610" d="5859">to improve and to repair, that not only do
you repair the things around you (they don’t</p>
<p t="4255469" d="5690">have to be within you, they can be anywhere
around you), you continually heal the structure</p>
<p t="4261159" d="1511">of being.</p>
<p t="4262670" d="3949">Well, that would be a good thing to try, you
know?</p>
<p t="4266619" d="3131">It’s a big deal, it’ll keep you busy.</p>
<p t="4269750" d="3840">It’ll provide your suffering with some meaning.</p>
<p t="4273590" d="2489">That’s a big deal.</p>
<p t="4276079" d="4701">And the alternative looks dreadful.</p>
<p t="4280780" d="7360">Well, you know, I walked you through all these
various theories, some of them about behaviour,</p>
<p t="4288140" d="4220">and some of them about personality, and some
of them about philosophy, and some of them</p>
<p t="4292360" d="1400">about clinical psychology.</p>
<p t="4293760" d="7990">And it’s an attempt to allow you to take
multiple snapshots of what a human being is</p>
<p t="4301750" d="4409">and how we might manifest ourselves.</p>
<p t="4306159" d="4801">For me, knowing all those things has been
ridiculously useful, ridiculously useful.</p>
<p t="4310960" d="3980">Far more practical than anything else I ever
learned.</p>
<p t="4314940" d="4710">And one of the advantages to knowing about
personality is that, you know, instead of</p>
<p t="4319650" d="5730">reducing the individual to some set of measurable
phenomena, which I’m all for by the way,</p>
<p t="4325380" d="7609">it also expands your conception of what the
individual can be to an almost unlimited degree.</p>
<p t="4332989" d="6380">So instead of a human being being something
that has to waver and be crushed under the</p>
<p t="4339369" d="4731">weight of its own being, a human being could
easily be something that could stand up and</p>
<p t="4344100" d="3860">say, yeah, well, I can handle that.</p>
<p t="4347960" d="1659">And I think people can do that.</p>
<p t="4349619" d="3580">People are so damn tough, it’s unbelievable.</p>
<p t="4353199" d="7611">I’ve seen people go through things that
are just grinding, terrible, and not only</p>
<p t="4360810" d="4471">come out the other side, but actually put
themselves together enough to clearly be a</p>
<p t="4365281" d="5789">force that rescues the culture and tries to
improve the structure of being.</p>
<p t="4371070" d="1919">And so hooray for us.</p>
<p t="4372989" d="7420">If we can do that, that more than justifies
whatever horrors might be laid at our collective</p>
<p t="4380409" d="2000">feet.</p>
<p t="4382409" d="8520">So, I would say, don’t underestimate yourself.</p>
<p t="4390929" d="3121">You guys all have a lot going for you.</p>
<p t="4394050" d="9310">You’re smart, you’re young, you’re reasonably
conscientious, a number of you are creative.</p>
<p t="4403360" d="4429">You have access, tremendous access, to technological
power.</p>
<p t="4407789" d="5071">So God only knows what you might manage to
hammer yourself into over the next thirty</p>
<p t="4412860" d="1940">years or so.</p>
<p t="4414800" d="4910">But the more people that try to make things
better, consciously, rather than worse, the</p>
<p t="4419710" d="2510">better off everything is going to be.</p>
<p t="4422220" d="4600">And that would be a hell of a fine thing to
aim for.</p>
<p t="4426820" d="4879">That’s mostly what I’ve learned from studying
personality.</p>
<p t="4431699" d="5961">So thank you very much for attending the course,
and good luck with the final!</p>
