<p t="4170" d="2100">Hi, guys.</p>
<p t="6270" d="8340">So we’re going to talk about the brain today.</p>
<p t="14610" d="4590">Last lecture I talked to you a little bit
about construct validation and what it means</p>
<p t="19200" d="6020">to measure something and so, we’re going
to take a bit of a detour.</p>
<p t="25220" d="7140">So I told you about measurement problems last
time.</p>
<p t="32360" d="5230">If you do your measurement properly in psychometrics—if
you’re studying personality, if you’re</p>
<p t="37590" d="6240">studying individual differences—there are
roughly six things that you can discover and</p>
<p t="43830" d="3220">they can be broken up different ways.</p>
<p t="47050" d="6360">That’s the big five model: extraversion,
neuroticism, agreeableness, contentiousness,</p>
<p t="53410" d="4430">openness, and they can be subdivided as you
should know because, in principle, you’ve</p>
<p t="57840" d="3230">read the paper that subdivided them into ten.</p>
<p t="61070" d="5260">That turns out to be quite useful, but for
now we’ll just presume that there are five,</p>
<p t="66330" d="6499">and then the other factor of human function
that’s pretty easy to derive and measure</p>
<p t="72829" d="1430">is IQ.</p>
<p t="74259" d="6201">Now, IQ likely nests under openness because
openness looks like it’s something roughly</p>
<p t="80460" d="4790">like intellect which is interest in ideas,
but—that’s probably an ability with ideas—but</p>
<p t="85250" d="4890">that’s probably measured better by an IQ
test, so if I ask you how smart you are and</p>
<p t="90140" d="3530">you say you’re pretty smart that would give
you a relatively high score on the intellect</p>
<p t="93670" d="4920">scale, but if I tested your IQ I will get
a better measure than that so in some sense</p>
<p t="98590" d="3209">IQ nests inside the big five model.</p>
<p t="101799" d="4070">But you can think about it as a separate thing
and I think it’s reasonable to do that so,</p>
<p t="105869" d="4460">you know, it depends on what you’re up to
fundamentally.</p>
<p t="110329" d="6321">Now, when the big five was first invented—invented
or discovered, depending on how you look at</p>
<p t="116650" d="5639">it—as I mentioned briefly, as well, it was
brute force statistics basically, so the idea</p>
<p t="122289" d="6291">behind the big five is that the—it’s called
the lexical hypothesis—and the lexical hypothesis</p>
<p t="128580" d="6670">is that, because human traits are so important
to us because we want to understand ourselves</p>
<p t="135250" d="4510">and, perhaps even more importantly, we want
to understand other people, and because we</p>
<p t="139760" d="5600">have language, there’s a reasonable probability
that we’ve encapsulated the structure of</p>
<p t="145360" d="3280">human personality within our language.</p>
<p t="148640" d="7250">And so, if you analyze the linguistic representations
properly, then perhaps you can extract out</p>
<p t="155890" d="4660">the central personality features, and that’s
basically what the lexical hypothesis is.</p>
<p t="160550" d="2140">And it’s important to know the lexical hypotheses.</p>
<p t="162690" d="6579">And it’s a bit more sophisticated than that
because it basically presumes that you can</p>
<p t="169269" d="6701">extract out relevant information about personality
from adjectives—descriptive adjectives—from</p>
<p t="175970" d="6349">phrases and from questions, and you’ll get
the same basic dimensional structure regardless</p>
<p t="182319" d="2331">of which of those techniques you use.</p>
<p t="184650" d="6360">And that turns out to be true for all intents
and purposes.</p>
<p t="191010" d="6320">Now, the lexical hypothesis depends on its
validity, depends for its validity on the</p>
<p t="197330" d="4629">initial claim that personality is accurately
represented within the structure of language.</p>
<p t="201959" d="6471">And so one of the things I would say is that
there’s a weak big five hypothesis and a</p>
<p t="208430" d="2540">strong big five hypothesis, okay?</p>
<p t="210970" d="7489">The weak big five hypothesis is that, insofar
as you use language to describe personality,</p>
<p t="218459" d="1961">personality has a five factor structure that’s
reliably extractable.</p>
<p t="220420" d="8149">Now the strong big five theory is that, no
no, personality has a five factor structure,</p>
<p t="228569" d="4341">and it’s accurately represented in language,
but when you pull out the structure from language,</p>
<p t="232910" d="6340">what you’re pulling out is actually representative
of genuine personality.</p>
<p t="239250" d="5500">Now, the weak hypothesis, I would say, is
established.</p>
<p t="244750" d="5520">And it’s worth knowing because what it means
is that if you invent a questionnaire that</p>
<p t="250270" d="4140">has anything to do with self description,
it might be self description at multiple different</p>
<p t="254410" d="7750">levels of analysis, like values for example,
instead of just adjectives, or attitudes instead</p>
<p t="262160" d="4820">of just adjectives, I mean, these categories
are sort of unclear.</p>
<p t="266980" d="4110">What’s the difference between your attitude
and your temperament?</p>
<p t="271090" d="4400">Well, it’s usually defined by the sentence
that you use the words in, right, you extract</p>
<p t="275490" d="6400">out the words, they sort of stand there alone—it’
s very difficult to clarify their meaning.</p>
<p t="281890" d="8210">Anyways, the lexical hypothesis I think is
one of the most well established—it’s</p>
<p t="290100" d="3340">one of the most well-validated claims in psychology.</p>
<p t="293440" d="5450">I think it may be the most validated claim,
apart from maybe the work that has extracted</p>
<p t="298890" d="3460">IQ out from cognitive questions.</p>
<p t="302350" d="6840">And basically it was brute force statistics,
you know, people developed different lists</p>
<p t="309190" d="4140">of adjectives and you can complain in some
ways about how they did it, and we’ll talk</p>
<p t="313330" d="4630">about that a bit later, but, because they
tried to throw out evaluative words like good</p>
<p t="317960" d="5600">and evil for example—those aren’t in the
big five—so they tried to only use adjectives</p>
<p t="323560" d="6440">that didn’t necessarily seem to be, like,
valued or devalued.</p>
<p t="330000" d="4950">So introvert and extrovert, well, they’re
opposites, but is it better to be an introvert?</p>
<p t="334950" d="2290">Is it better to be an extravert?</p>
<p t="337240" d="5880">Well, it’s not obvious so all the words
that cover that dimension can be kept in because</p>
<p t="343120" d="4820">there’s no value judgments associated with
it and the originators of the big five theory</p>
<p t="347940" d="3100">wanted to keep it as free of values as possible.</p>
<p t="351040" d="2180">Now that’s already a hypothesis right?</p>
<p t="353220" d="5650">It’s a hypothesis that you can come up with
an accurate description of human personality</p>
<p t="358870" d="4130">even if you eliminate all the words that are
clearly valenced.</p>
<p t="363000" d="4420">And we did an experiment here a while back
that was pretty interesting.</p>
<p t="367420" d="5580">We got hold of a data set of descriptive adjectives
and we put all the evaluative words back in.</p>
<p t="373000" d="9990">So, like nasty and horrible and awkward and
cruel, and then the good words as well: moral,</p>
<p t="382990" d="3030">pleasant, uplifting, all those things.</p>
<p t="386020" d="4820">And then we had people rate people they liked
and people they didn’t like using that expanded</p>
<p t="390840" d="5800">list and we got a real archetype in some sense
of the hateable person and a tremendous number</p>
<p t="396640" d="3830">of the words that were used came from the
evaluative dimension.</p>
<p t="400470" d="4330">So I think that when you throw out the evaluative
words you actually throw out a lot of what</p>
<p t="404800" d="4830">people actually use, descriptive words to
describe, because when you like someone or</p>
<p t="409630" d="5330">don’t like someone, if someone’s likeable
or unlikeable that’s a pretty important</p>
<p t="414960" d="1000">phenomena.</p>
<p t="415960" d="4380">I mean, you hang around the people you like
generally speaking and you don’t associate</p>
<p t="420340" d="2630">with the people you don’t like, so it’s
a fundamental choice.</p>
<p t="422970" d="5610">But we’ll talk about that later because
there’s reasons that happened and the reasons</p>
<p t="428580" d="3470">were valid, and it’s not that easy to fix
it.</p>
<p t="432050" d="4040">And besides that, the standard five factor
model has all sorts of utility.</p>
<p t="436090" d="4440">But you need to know what its strengths are
and its limitations are.</p>
<p t="440530" d="4770">Now, hypothetically, what you do to draw out
the five factor model was you take, imagine</p>
<p t="445300" d="5760">a set of all descriptive adjectives, okay,
and then you take a random sample of those</p>
<p t="451060" d="4830">descriptive adjectives, so that it’s not
biased—you’re not going to use all of</p>
<p t="455890" d="3690">them because, you know, if you asked someone
to describe themselves on a questionnaire</p>
<p t="459580" d="4790">using all the adjectives we have to describe
personality they’d be there for like a day.</p>
<p t="464370" d="1080">And so that’s not every efficient.</p>
<p t="465450" d="2630">And so you want to take a random sample.</p>
<p t="468080" d="4000">Maybe you only sample the words that people
are most likely to use.</p>
<p t="472080" d="4170">So for example if you go online you’ll find
that there are word frequency tables.</p>
<p t="476250" d="8400">You know, most of your language, about 500
words covers about 80% of what you say.</p>
<p t="484650" d="5290">You know, and I don’t remember what the
lexicon of the typical person is, I think</p>
<p t="489940" d="5110">it’s in the neighbourhood of 3500 words,
but that might be wrong, but there’s like</p>
<p t="495050" d="1960">750,000 words in the English language.</p>
<p t="497010" d="4090">It’s an omnivorous language, it just pulls
words in from all over.</p>
<p t="501100" d="6050">And so we hardly use any of those words, and
you know, there’s ones that are used extraordinarily</p>
<p t="507150" d="1220">infrequently.</p>
<p t="508370" d="4250">So what you could do is you could look at
the total set of adjectives and then you could</p>
<p t="512620" d="5740">pull out, you know, identify the ones that
are used,, you know, the thousand most frequently</p>
<p t="518360" d="4149">used words and that’d probably cover 95%
of the territory, and then you can pick out</p>
<p t="522509" d="2031">a random set of 100.</p>
<p t="524540" d="3719">Then you could administer it to people, and
then you could factor analyze it—you’d</p>
<p t="528259" d="4570">administer it to lots of people—then you
factor analyze it and you get five relatively</p>
<p t="532829" d="1880">clear and stable factors.</p>
<p t="534709" d="7060">And the one that comes out first, it’s the
dominant factor in some sense, or the easiest</p>
<p t="541769" d="3841">measure or maybe the best represented in language
or something like that, it’s extraversion</p>
<p t="545610" d="2260">versus introversion.</p>
<p t="547870" d="4699">And the extraversion is a positive emotion
dimension.</p>
<p t="552569" d="7560">And it’s associated with enthusiasm and
assertiveness.</p>
<p t="560129" d="3971">And assertive people will say, they’ll dominate
the conversation with language.</p>
<p t="564100" d="4599">Or, well basically that’s the way to think
about it.</p>
<p t="568699" d="3242">Enthusiastic people, they’re up for anything,
you know, they’re the ones they’re always</p>
<p t="571941" d="1688">smiling and telling jokes and having parties
and that sort of thing.</p>
<p t="573629" d="4890">And generally extroverts really like to be
around people.</p>
<p t="578519" d="4351">So they’re happy, they’re gregarious,
they’re assertive, they’re enthusiastic,</p>
<p t="582870" d="4719">they’re noisy, they blink more than introverts—now
why that is I have no idea, but apparently</p>
<p t="587589" d="1291">they do [student laughter].</p>
<p t="588880" d="6420">So if you notice someone blinking a lot you
can assume that they’re extroverts.</p>
<p t="595300" d="4099">If they’re not conscientious , you know
there’s this idea of people being impulsive,</p>
<p t="599399" d="4971">it’s a very badly defined term so when you
hear a psychologist talking about impulsivity</p>
<p t="604370" d="3290">the first think you could realize is they
don’t know, you don’t know what they’re</p>
<p t="607660" d="3729">talking about because probably there’s no
such thing as impulsivity.</p>
<p t="611389" d="8110">But extraverted people who are not very conscientious
tend to--that&#39;s one of the things you might</p>
<p t="619499" d="2001">think about as associated with impulsivity.</p>
<p t="621500" d="5499">There&#39;s all sorts of other things though to,
so--okay there&#39;s a positive emption dimension</p>
<p t="626999" d="5001">and that&#39;s extraversion and there&#39;s a negative
emotion dimension and that&#39;s neuroticism.</p>
<p t="632000" d="4300">And neuroticism seems to break down into something
like withdrawal and volatility.</p>
<p t="636300" d="1909">And volatile people are touchy.</p>
<p t="638209" d="4641">So, you know, they&#39;ll react quite a lot if
something negative happens.</p>
<p t="642850" d="3950">So if you tease them they might get upset
or if you start fighting with them in a sort</p>
<p t="646800" d="4670">of provocative way instead of sort of calming
everything down, they&#39;ll just ramp it up.</p>
<p t="651470" d="4210">And if there&#39;s two of you that&#39;re volatile
and you&#39;re having a conversation and the conversation</p>
<p t="655680" d="4690">goes a little bit, you know, into unpleasant
territory, you can really get each other going.</p>
<p t="660370" d="1519">So, yes?</p>
<p t="661889" d="6061">Student: &quot;Is it like, in terms of the hero,
like internal states?&quot;</p>
<p t="667950" d="1000">Both.</p>
<p t="668950" d="1000">Both, yeah.</p>
<p t="669950" d="2000">I mean, that&#39;s part of the problem with using
the word emotion because, you know, is an</p>
<p t="671950" d="4489">emotion an internal state or a set of behaviours,
and the answer to that is, as far as we can</p>
<p t="676439" d="1281">tell it&#39;s both.</p>
<p t="677720" d="7919">So now, I&#39;m going to start talking about extraversion
and neuroticism, and part of the reason for</p>
<p t="685639" d="5320">that is because I think the evidence for the
relationship between those traits and the</p>
<p t="690959" d="3721">way the brain functions is, in some sense,
the clearest.</p>
<p t="694680" d="5370">Now, you remember the big five were extracted
out using statistical procedures, right, so</p>
<p t="700050" d="5260">there&#39;s no reason to assume necessarily that
the traits would bear any straightforward</p>
<p t="705310" d="3100">relationship to brain function.</p>
<p t="708410" d="3890">Because they weren&#39;t derived from analysis
of brain function.</p>
<p t="712300" d="2270">At least not directly.</p>
<p t="714570" d="4950">They were extracted from analysis of linguistic
representations of other people&#39;s and your</p>
<p t="719520" d="1379">own behaviour.</p>
<p t="720899" d="5771">But it turns out that there&#39;s quite a concordance
between certain elements of neuropsychological</p>
<p t="726670" d="6849">theory and the positive and negative emotional
traits: extraversion and neuroticism.</p>
<p t="733519" d="5281">And so what I&#39;m going to do today is, I&#39;m
going to talk to you about how positive and</p>
<p t="738800" d="7620">negative emotion are instantiated in some
sense, neurologically.</p>
<p t="746420" d="7180">But I&#39;m going to put that in a broader picture
of brain function because, well first of all,</p>
<p t="753600" d="1000">why not?</p>
<p t="754600" d="2890">And second because a lot of the things I&#39;m
going to tell you about the brain today will</p>
<p t="757490" d="4539">sort of retroactively shed light on some of
the clinical theories we&#39;ve already talked</p>
<p t="762029" d="1170">about.</p>
<p t="763199" d="5521">So, which is nice, you know, because, one
of the ways you find out if something is true,</p>
<p t="768720" d="4700">and this is something we also talked about
during the last lecture, is that it manifests</p>
<p t="773420" d="3609">itself even when you use different measurement
techniques.</p>
<p t="777029" d="5081">And so you have statistical derivation, you
know, which basically took place, it really</p>
<p t="782110" d="5013">started to accelerate I would say, first in
the 1960s and then in the 1980s--it made a</p>
<p t="787123" d="1936">big comeback in the 1980s.</p>
<p t="789059" d="2830">But paralleling that were theories of brain
development.</p>
<p t="791889" d="4112">And they weren&#39;t really--the scientists that
were doing the one sort of research weren&#39;t</p>
<p t="796001" d="3289">really communicating with the scientists that
were doing the other kind of research.</p>
<p t="799290" d="1430">So they were methodologically separate.</p>
<p t="800720" d="2119">They used different techniques as well.</p>
<p t="802839" d="4641">They weren&#39;t talking back and forth much and
they were using different measurement techniques.</p>
<p t="807480" d="4461">So if they both come up with the same thing
then you think, oh well there&#39;s probably something</p>
<p t="811941" d="5549">to that because, you know, the sighted people
discovered it and the people who could hear</p>
<p t="817490" d="1000">discovered it.</p>
<p t="818490" d="2070">It&#39;s the same kind of idea.</p>
<p t="820560" d="8819">So, and you know, this has been worked out
in a fair bit of detail over the last 30 years</p>
<p t="829379" d="1551">really.</p>
<p t="830930" d="5700">And so the papers that you&#39;re supposed to
read with this, they&#39;re difficult papers.</p>
<p t="836630" d="4309">I believe you&#39;re reading Grey, which is a
model of the limbic system and basal ganglia,</p>
<p t="840939" d="3051">applications to anxiety and schizophrenia.</p>
<p t="843990" d="5150">And I think you have goals and behaviour,
that&#39;s the Carver&amp;Scheier paper.</p>
<p t="849140" d="2910">I put the Swanson paper in as optional.</p>
<p t="852050" d="2819">That&#39;s cerebral hemisphere regulation and
motivated behaviour.</p>
<p t="854869" d="1660">That is a tough paper.</p>
<p t="856529" d="1701">And so is the Grey paper.</p>
<p t="858230" d="7240">And it&#39;s partly because these guys, both of
them, Grey&#39;s paper is a distillation of a</p>
<p t="865470" d="2669">very very thick book that&#39;s very very difficult.</p>
<p t="868139" d="1041">And that&#39;s been written twice.</p>
<p t="869180" d="3519">It was published first in 1982 and then again
in 1999.</p>
<p t="872699" d="1620">It&#39;s a brilliant book.</p>
<p t="874319" d="2651">It&#39;s had a tremendous impact on psychology.</p>
<p t="876970" d="4760">Grey was one of those people who, he was so
damned smart it was just painful.</p>
<p t="881730" d="3460">His reference list--I don&#39;t know how many
papers are in his reference list.</p>
<p t="885190" d="1160">Like 2,000.</p>
<p t="886350" d="3320">And one of the really weird things about Grey
that makes him stand out among scientists</p>
<p t="889670" d="2070">is, he actually read all those papers.</p>
<p t="891740" d="2810">And more than that, he understood them.</p>
<p t="894550" d="1310">And so that&#39;s really something.</p>
<p t="895860" d="7820">And so Grey&#39;s book on anxiety--he did a lot
of work on animal behaviour and, I&#39;ll tell</p>
<p t="903680" d="6110">you, if you want solid psychological information
about how the brain works, the people you</p>
<p t="909790" d="6760">pay attention to are the people who are studying
animal behaviour and animal brains.</p>
<p t="916550" d="1190">They know what they&#39;re doing.</p>
<p t="917740" d="1829">They&#39;re so methodologically careful.</p>
<p t="919569" d="1820">They&#39;re very very reliable.</p>
<p t="921389" d="4310">And the human neuropsychologists and the people
that use PET scanners and MRIs and all those</p>
<p t="925699" d="2841">things, they&#39;re way way way behind the animal
researchers.</p>
<p t="928540" d="4390">Because the animal researchers can just get
in there at a lot higher resolution and they</p>
<p t="932930" d="1930">can do much more stringent experiments.</p>
<p t="934860" d="4899">And they tend to be more methodologically
careful and more scientifically-minded.</p>
<p t="939759" d="2580">So anyways, the Grey book is a brilliant book.</p>
<p t="942339" d="2750">It took me like four months to read that damn
book.</p>
<p t="945089" d="6990">And I mean I really had to take it apart because
he probably poured 30 years of work into it,</p>
<p t="952079" d="2341">something like that.</p>
<p t="954420" d="1310">He worked a lot in 30 years.</p>
<p t="955730" d="1000">You know?</p>
<p t="956730" d="4109">He did a lot of experimentation and he read
a lot and so he built a model of the brain&#39;s</p>
<p t="960839" d="6211">function that was based partly on Russian
neuropsychology, partly on cybernetic theory,</p>
<p t="967050" d="6229">partly on animal behaviour, partly on neuropsychopharmacology,
and so that&#39;s the study of how drugs affect</p>
<p t="973279" d="6220">behaviour and cognition, and then partly from
a higher order conceptual perspective.</p>
<p t="979499" d="3671">And then he stacked all those things up, one
on top of the other, to make sure that the</p>
<p t="983170" d="3449">picture was the same at every single level
of analysis.</p>
<p t="986619" d="4741">It&#39;s absolutely brilliant work and it took
the social psychologists like--they really</p>
<p t="991360" d="4750">started about Grey, although he published
his book in 1982--they probably started thinking</p>
<p t="996110" d="1800">Grey seriously in about 2005.</p>
<p t="997910" d="7649">So it took 23 years for his book to start
to make its wide-scale entrance in the more</p>
<p t="1005559" d="2491">general psychological community.</p>
<p t="1008050" d="4860">Anyways, and so you&#39;re going to read this
paper which is a model of the limbic system</p>
<p t="1012910" d="1590">and basal ganglia.</p>
<p t="1014500" d="4730">And 30 years were distilled into the book
and then that was distilled into this paper.</p>
<p t="1019230" d="2889">So you know, it&#39;s rough going.</p>
<p t="1022119" d="5901">And then the Swanson paper, he&#39;s another guy--same
kind of guy--he&#39;s a developmental neuroanatomist</p>
<p t="1028020" d="5040">and if you&#39;re really interested in psychology
I would really recommend reading those papers</p>
<p t="1033060" d="6440">because they&#39;re hard going, but if you get
it, you have this substrata of knowledge underneath</p>
<p t="1039500" d="1550">you that&#39;s really firm.</p>
<p t="1041050" d="3260">And I really like Swanson&#39;s paper--the guy&#39;s
a genius.</p>
<p t="1044310" d="4960">And what&#39;s so cool about Swanson&#39;s paper is
that, if you talk to human neuropsychologists</p>
<p t="1049270" d="3870">you&#39;ll find that they&#39;re biased toward the
cerebral cortex.</p>
<p t="1053140" d="3730">And they&#39;re sort of, I think there&#39;s sort
of an anthropomorphic pride that goes along</p>
<p t="1056870" d="1000">with that.</p>
<p t="1057870" d="1160">It&#39;s like, well how are we different from
animals.</p>
<p t="1059030" d="4160">Well, you know, we&#39;ve got thumbs and that&#39;s
great--hurray for the thumbs--and we stand</p>
<p t="1063190" d="4460">upright, but if you look at us neurologically
the big difference is that we have this tremendously</p>
<p t="1067650" d="6190">expanded cerebral cortex, especially the prefrontal
cortex, and so then people think--well because,</p>
<p t="1073840" d="4050">you know, because that&#39;s one of the things
that differentiates us from animals and it&#39;s</p>
<p t="1077890" d="5070">relatively evolutionarily modern, because
the human brain really really developed rapidly</p>
<p t="1082960" d="5910">over the last two million years, that it&#39;s
like king of the brain in some sense.</p>
<p t="1088870" d="3400">And it&#39;s the place where all the complicated
things happen.</p>
<p t="1092270" d="4840">And that&#39;s just not right, because like, breathing--that&#39;s
complicated.</p>
<p t="1097110" d="2600">That&#39;s why you don&#39;t get to control it voluntarily.</p>
<p t="1099710" d="4350">And keeping your heart going, that&#39;s complicated
too, and so you don&#39;t get to have a decision</p>
<p t="1104060" d="1000">about that.</p>
<p t="1105060" d="2240">Your brain has made that automatic.</p>
<p t="1107300" d="4330">Like millions of years ago because there&#39;s
just no way you&#39;re going to get voluntary</p>
<p t="1111630" d="2260">control over something that&#39;s that vital.</p>
<p t="1113890" d="7020">You know, so, assuming that newer brain areas
do more complex things, in some ways I think</p>
<p t="1120910" d="1760">that&#39;s actually precisely backwards.</p>
<p t="1122670" d="5900">It&#39;s the old brain areas that&#39;ve been around
for, you know, a hundred million years, those</p>
<p t="1128570" d="1600">things are smart.</p>
<p t="1130170" d="5480">And that&#39;s why they survived for so long and
why they&#39;re distributed in so many different</p>
<p t="1135650" d="1160">species.</p>
<p t="1136810" d="5430">Your brain is somewhat like a lobster&#39;s brain--it&#39;s
a lot like a mouse brain.</p>
<p t="1142240" d="1240">And it&#39;s a lot like a rat brain.</p>
<p t="1143480" d="4160">And you might think a rat isn&#39;t a very good
model of a human, because after all, they&#39;re</p>
<p t="1147640" d="5010">rats, but one thing I can tell you is that
a rat brain is a way better model of a human</p>
<p t="1152650" d="4730">brain than your model of human brain is a
model of the human brain.</p>
<p t="1157380" d="1000">You know what I mean?</p>
<p t="1158380" d="1610">It&#39;s like people think of the brain.</p>
<p t="1159990" d="1870">Well, they have a dopey model.</p>
<p t="1161860" d="6020">Use a rat as an example, of course it&#39;s off
in some ways because rats can&#39;t talk for example,</p>
<p t="1167880" d="6120">but there are so many levels of analysis where
you might as well be a rat, you know?</p>
<p t="1174000" d="1000">Technically speaking.</p>
<p t="1175000" d="3210">The pharmacology for example is very very
similar.</p>
<p t="1178210" d="5370">The function of the neurotransmitters, the
basic anatomy of the structures.</p>
<p t="1183580" d="3000">There&#39;s a tremendous amount of overlap.</p>
<p t="1186580" d="6240">And so you might as well go for the commonalities
among brains before you focus in on the differences,</p>
<p t="1192820" d="3710">because in some sense that way you get the
basic architecture right.</p>
<p t="1196530" d="6120">Now one of the things that&#39;s really interesting
about Swanson, and he&#39;s not a neuropsychologist</p>
<p t="1202650" d="4870">and he&#39;s not really even a psychologist--he&#39;s
a developmental neuroanatomist.</p>
<p t="1207520" d="5430">And so, there&#39;s lots of ways of chopping up
the brain, you know, to look at it, because</p>
<p t="1212950" d="1540">it&#39;s a really complicated thing.</p>
<p t="1214490" d="5050">It&#39;s like saying, well how many ways can you
divide up a city to analyze it.</p>
<p t="1219540" d="5780">Well, there&#39;s endless number of ways that
you can divide up a city to look at it.</p>
<p t="1225320" d="5700">It&#39;s the same with the brain because it&#39;s
infinitely subdividable, in some sense, certainly</p>
<p t="1231020" d="2440">all the way down to the molecular structures.</p>
<p t="1233460" d="5000">And then even at higher order levels, you
know, because it&#39;s so complex and it&#39;s hierarchically</p>
<p t="1238460" d="5170">structured you can just divide it up in all
sorts of different ways and so, at higher</p>
<p t="1243630" d="4550">levels of resolution there isn&#39;t even that
much agreement on how to name the parts.</p>
<p t="1248180" d="4820">Now, what the developmental neuroanatomists
do is that they look at how the brain develops</p>
<p t="1253000" d="2010">in utero over time.</p>
<p t="1255010" d="4850">Because it&#39;s a developing thing that sort
of unfolds like a flower unfolds, you know?</p>
<p t="1259860" d="5780">And you can track which part of the early
brain turns into the later brain and you can</p>
<p t="1265640" d="5170">get some sense of the--it&#39;s like an evolutionary
tree you know?</p>
<p t="1270810" d="4710">If these three parts grew out of this part
then you can assume that there&#39;s some commonality</p>
<p t="1275520" d="1000">between them.</p>
<p t="1276520" d="2590">And that can also help you figure out how
to divide up the brain.</p>
<p t="1279110" d="2430">And so that&#39;s one of the things that Swanson
does.</p>
<p t="1281540" d="4450">But the other thing he does that I really
like is that, instead of looking at the brain</p>
<p t="1285990" d="4790">from top down which is what human neuropsychologists
tend to do because they concentrate on say</p>
<p t="1290780" d="6160">language and higher order cognitive functions,
which we think of as complex but you think,</p>
<p t="1296940" d="5140">they&#39;re not that damn complex, you know, like
a computer can do mathematics so much better</p>
<p t="1302080" d="3010">than you that there&#39;s not even any comparison,
you know.</p>
<p t="1305090" d="5480">And it won&#39;t be very long before a lot of
the things that we think of as abstract cognition</p>
<p t="1310570" d="2303">are things that computers are going to be
able to do.</p>
<p t="1312873" d="2477">They just won GO tournament, for example.</p>
<p t="1315350" d="4710">And the computers are now better--even your
PC is better at playing chess than probably</p>
<p t="1320060" d="1520">anyone in this room.</p>
<p t="1321580" d="4820">And the really high end computers are better
at playing chess than anyone who lives.</p>
<p t="1326400" d="3550">And so computers are catching up damn fast,
but you&#39;ll notice that they don&#39;t do things</p>
<p t="1329950" d="3570">like bus tables in restaurants, because it
turns out that&#39;s really hard.</p>
<p t="1333520" d="2700">[Student laughter] Well, I mean think about
it.</p>
<p t="1336220" d="1000">It&#39;s hard.</p>
<p t="1337220" d="2560">You&#39;re carrying different sized loads all
the time.</p>
<p t="1339780" d="2510">You have to interact socially with people
properly.</p>
<p t="1342290" d="1650">You have to stay the hell out of the way.</p>
<p t="1343940" d="4650">You have to exactly time when you&#39;re going
to come to the table.</p>
<p t="1348590" d="3620">You have to move extraordinarily efficiently,
especially as the place gets busy.</p>
<p t="1352210" d="3690">You know, there&#39;s a lot of demands on you
to do that job effectively.</p>
<p t="1355900" d="5670">And you know, we think about it as a low end
job but it&#39;s not automated.</p>
<p t="1361570" d="2800">The low end jobs are the ones that are going
to be automated first.</p>
<p t="1364370" d="4050">And it&#39;s not obvious that they&#39;re going to
be the things that we associated with low-end</p>
<p t="1368420" d="1460">labour.</p>
<p t="1369880" d="1310">It&#39;s just that--well.</p>
<p t="1371190" d="6560">Now, what Swanson did with the nervous system--I
was so happy when I found this paper because--he</p>
<p t="1377750" d="3760">did exactly with the nervous system what Piaget
did with children.</p>
<p t="1381510" d="4270">He showed how the nervous system builds itself
from the bottom up.</p>
<p t="1385780" d="4730">And so Swanson lays right on top of Piaget--it&#39;s
lovely.</p>
<p t="1390510" d="5020">And then the other thing that Swanson does
very very nicely is, he elucidates a lot of</p>
<p t="1395530" d="2770">the Freudian presuppositions.</p>
<p t="1398300" d="5420">So Freud of course talked about the id, and
the id is this, it&#39;s sort of like the archaic</p>
<p t="1403720" d="1540">brain in some sense, you know.</p>
<p t="1405260" d="3220">It&#39;s where all your primal impulses lurk.</p>
<p t="1408480" d="2390">And you know he called that one thing the
id.</p>
<p t="1410870" d="8890">Well you might say, well is there an id in
the brain and the answer is, well, vaguely.</p>
<p t="1419760" d="1860">Vaguely.</p>
<p t="1421620" d="4850">The brain does differ in terms of the age
of its subcomponents.</p>
<p t="1426470" d="5270">And as you go deeper into the brain and closer
to the spine, the brain areas get phylogenetically</p>
<p t="1431740" d="4320">older, and the more phylogenetically older
areas of the brain, which are underneath the</p>
<p t="1436060" d="3950">cortex, they have their own little circuits.</p>
<p t="1440010" d="4600">And there&#39;s some commonality between them,
and they do govern primal--I think of them</p>
<p t="1444610" d="2270">as primal sub-personalities.</p>
<p t="1446880" d="1700">We&#39;ve talked about that before.</p>
<p t="1448580" d="4750">It&#39;s better than thinking about them as drives
or goals or anything like that because not</p>
<p t="1453330" d="8090">only do they--they&#39;re like sets of associated
behaviours, but they&#39;re not just that.</p>
<p t="1461420" d="4490">They&#39;re also ways of looking at the world
and ways of thinking about the world.</p>
<p t="1465910" d="6160">So, you know, if you&#39;re angry, it&#39;s not like
you&#39;re being driven to use your fists.</p>
<p t="1472070" d="1000">That&#39;s not how it works.</p>
<p t="1473070" d="4610">What happens is that the angry subpersonality
comes out and, you know, it does a whole bunch</p>
<p t="1477680" d="1000">of things.</p>
<p t="1478680" d="2650">It&#39;s got its own state of arousal.</p>
<p t="1481330" d="4260">It&#39;s characterized both by positive and negative
emotion, which is something that&#39;s quite peculiar</p>
<p t="1485590" d="6240">about anger, because it&#39;s both a defensive
action and an aggressive, forward moving behaviour.</p>
<p t="1491830" d="1460">And it has a viewpoint.</p>
<p t="1493290" d="1320">Like it&#39;s a biased viewpoint.</p>
<p t="1494610" d="3770">If you&#39;re angry with someone, all you can
see about them is how damn irritating they</p>
<p t="1498380" d="2240">are and how much they need to be defeated.</p>
<p t="1500620" d="1040">You know, roughly speaking.</p>
<p t="1501660" d="2510">And so it&#39;s a whole personality.</p>
<p t="1504170" d="5390">Now, it&#39;s a one dimensional personality because
all it&#39;s really got is anger, and that&#39;s not</p>
<p t="1509560" d="2570">enough to solve every problem.</p>
<p t="1512130" d="5450">But you can&#39;t think about it as a drive exactly
because it&#39;s not deterministic.</p>
<p t="1517580" d="4340">You know, even when you&#39;re angry, you have
a range of choices to make.</p>
<p t="1521920" d="6420">Now, they&#39;re circumscribed by the fact that
you&#39;re angry, but it&#39;s best to think about</p>
<p t="1528340" d="1350">it as a sub personality.</p>
<p t="1529690" d="1910">I think you just get a lot farther that way.</p>
<p t="1531600" d="5330">Now, what Swanson did--you know how Piaget
talked about children/infants, they start</p>
<p t="1536930" d="4450">out with a few fundamental reflexes, right,
that they&#39;re sort of born with, including</p>
<p t="1541380" d="5760">the ability to use their mouth and their tongue
as an exploratory device.</p>
<p t="1547140" d="3660">And then they have certain reflexes that they
can manifest right away, and then they have</p>
<p t="1550800" d="2700">the ability to modify those reflexes.</p>
<p t="1553500" d="3480">And so, as far as Piaget was concerned, that
was enough to get the ball rolling.</p>
<p t="1556980" d="3100">It was sort of like the child was like booting
up across time.</p>
<p t="1560080" d="5810">It&#39;s got some, you know, outside of the operating
system you&#39;ve got some bare processes in your</p>
<p t="1565890" d="3670">computer that get it started enough so the
operating system can turn on.</p>
<p t="1569560" d="2840">It sort of unfolds up into something complex.</p>
<p t="1572400" d="2440">Well that&#39;s sort of what human beings do across
time.</p>
<p t="1574840" d="4800">They start out with these basic reflexes that
are simple movements and then they earn how</p>
<p t="1579640" d="3930">to modify the movements and then they learn
how to chain the movements together and then</p>
<p t="1583570" d="7710">they learn how to use the chained movements
as tools, in some sense, as embodied tools,</p>
<p t="1591280" d="6700">to allow these biologically determined sub-personalities
to operate in the world with some chance of</p>
<p t="1597980" d="1000">success.</p>
<p t="1598980" d="5000">Okay, now you can layer that onto the nervous
system, so part of what&#39;s happening when you</p>
<p t="1603980" d="4370">get these basic movements down, the ones that
are not automatic like your ability to grip</p>
<p t="1608350" d="6210">and the ability to do this with your hands
and all the basic subroutines you have with</p>
<p t="1614560" d="4000">your body--those are automatized, they&#39;re
made into little machines, and a lot of them</p>
<p t="1618560" d="2800">run spinally.</p>
<p t="1621360" d="3950">You know, because what you think in some sense
is that, if you&#39;re walking, you&#39;re thinking</p>
<p t="1625310" d="2330">about walking in some way--that&#39;s how you
walk.</p>
<p t="1627640" d="1290">And it&#39;s like, that&#39;s not right.</p>
<p t="1628930" d="5150">What happens is your orient yourself to a
goal, and in some sense you just disinhibit</p>
<p t="1634080" d="2330">the system that knows how to walk.</p>
<p t="1636410" d="3450">And then it more or less does it automatically,
and you know, you direct it.</p>
<p t="1639860" d="3020">And you can modify what it&#39;s doing if there&#39;s
an error.</p>
<p t="1642880" d="1340">But you kind of know that, right?</p>
<p t="1644220" d="4910">You drive to school or you drive somewhere
you&#39;re familiar to, you don&#39;t even necessarily</p>
<p t="1649130" d="3030">remember the drive if you&#39;ve done it 50 times.</p>
<p t="1652160" d="5000">It&#39;s because you&#39;re basically--in some sense
you&#39;re just sequencing automated behaviours.</p>
<p t="1657160" d="5370">And, a good thing too because, if you didn&#39;t
have those automated expert behaviours at</p>
<p t="1662530" d="3250">hand, you wouldn&#39;t know how to drive.</p>
<p t="1665780" d="6090">Because, you&#39;re just not smart--the time that
you drive most consciously is when you first</p>
<p t="1671870" d="1210">learn how to drive.</p>
<p t="1673080" d="6310">Well, you don&#39;t want a conscious driver, you
want an unconscious expert driver whose consciousness</p>
<p t="1679390" d="2900">is monitoring the world for anything unexpected.</p>
<p t="1682290" d="1000">That&#39;s what you want.</p>
<p t="1683290" d="2870">So, and that&#39;s the case with almost everything
you do.</p>
<p t="1686160" d="3960">If you have to become conscious of what you&#39;re
doing, the probability that you don&#39;t do it</p>
<p t="1690120" d="1670">very well is really high.</p>
<p t="1691790" d="3770">And you know that because maybe you&#39;re talking
to someone, it happens when I&#39;m lecturing</p>
<p t="1695560" d="4730">sometimes--if I&#39;m not really on top of things
I&#39;ll get self-conscious--and that&#39;s a terrible</p>
<p t="1700290" d="3290">thing to have happen when you lecture, you
know, it just makes you stumble.</p>
<p t="1703580" d="4870">If it&#39;s going well I know where I&#39;m going
and I have all these little routines that&#39;re</p>
<p t="1708450" d="3250">stories and things that I know that--they
just automatically sequence.</p>
<p t="1711700" d="5050">All I have to do is point the lecture in the
right direction and, you know, the things</p>
<p t="1716750" d="7160">that are logically associated with the direction
of the lecture will--they&#39;ll come up.</p>
<p t="1723910" d="2030">They&#39;re primed in some sense.</p>
<p t="1725940" d="6350">And so, Swanson helped me understand the functions
of the lower part of the brain quite well</p>
<p t="1732290" d="1680">and then to map that onto Piaget.</p>
<p t="1733970" d="5120">And one of the things he helped me understand
was just exactly how sophisticated the lower</p>
<p t="1739090" d="3000">parts of the brain are, the more automatic
parts.</p>
<p t="1742090" d="5050">Now, the behaviourists used to believe that,
or did believe and still believe to some degree,</p>
<p t="1747140" d="3130">that a lot of your behaviour is reflexive.</p>
<p t="1750270" d="5060">And the radical behaviourists, the guys from
the 50s, more or less made that case that</p>
<p t="1755330" d="5860">even complex behaviour among animals is nothing
but the chaining together of automatic reflexes.</p>
<p t="1761190" d="3440">So it was a deterministic chain of reflexes.</p>
<p t="1764630" d="5780">Well, you do have reflex actions, you know,
so if you touch a hot stove you&#39;ll jerk your</p>
<p t="1770410" d="4450">hand away, and your brain isn&#39;t involved in
that--it&#39;s just your spinal cord that&#39;s involved</p>
<p t="1774860" d="1000">in that.</p>
<p t="1775860" d="4070">Now, your brain is involved when the pain
hits, and maybe that&#39;s so you stop doing it</p>
<p t="1779930" d="5850">in the future, but the conscious part of your
brain is too slow to get your hand away from</p>
<p t="1785780" d="1300">the stove in time.</p>
<p t="1787080" d="4690">And so, what&#39;s happening in your body in some
sense is that you have these multiple layers</p>
<p t="1791770" d="5860">of neurological organization and some of them
are quite fixed--they&#39;re automatic deterministic</p>
<p t="1797630" d="4050">systems and those are things you&#39;ve really
really practiced and that you can just can</p>
<p t="1801680" d="1790">run as a routine.</p>
<p t="1803470" d="4000">And above that are those things that you&#39;ve
chained together, but they can be chained</p>
<p t="1807470" d="2910">together in different ways so they&#39;re less
automatized.</p>
<p t="1810380" d="5390">And then if you keep going up they get more
and more complex and less automatized, until</p>
<p t="1815770" d="5550">at the top, which is where your consciousness
is, roughly speaking, you have to program</p>
<p t="1821320" d="1400">what you&#39;re doing, you know.</p>
<p t="1822720" d="4650">You have to pay very careful attention to
how to go about doing this because you don&#39;t</p>
<p t="1827370" d="2270">have the systems built into you.</p>
<p t="1829640" d="3420">So you know what that&#39;s like if you&#39;re trying
to learn something new, it takes a lot of</p>
<p t="1833060" d="3180">energy and you really have to pay attention.</p>
<p t="1836240" d="6890">And then once you start to get it, well, what
really happens is there&#39;s things you don&#39;t</p>
<p t="1843130" d="1690">have to think about any more.</p>
<p t="1844820" d="4500">And thank god for that, because first of all,
you can&#39;t think that much because you&#39;re a</p>
<p t="1849320" d="5810">limited capacity processor, and second, the
programming is quite difficult.</p>
<p t="1855130" d="27850">Okay so </p>
<p t="1882980" d="4760">if you look on the right there, there&#39;s a
little diagram that&#39;s a hierarchical--or a</p>
<p t="1887740" d="3960">little table really and it&#39;s talking about
the motor system.</p>
<p t="1891700" d="5870">Now the motor system is what allows you to
output action.</p>
<p t="1897570" d="4200">And you&#39;re outputting action at all sorts
of levels that you don&#39;t even realize because,</p>
<p t="1901770" d="6070">you know, you might think that sight is a
sensory activity, for example, but there&#39;s</p>
<p t="1907840" d="3220">a very tight relationship between sensory
activity and motor activity.</p>
<p t="1911060" d="3670">So, for example, when you&#39;re looking at a
scene, even though you don&#39;t know it, your</p>
<p t="1914730" d="2120">eyes are going like this.</p>
<p t="1916850" d="3660">And the reason you&#39;re going like that is because
if you held your eyes absolutely still, and</p>
<p t="1920510" d="3650">you can actually learn to do this, if you
hold your eyes absolutely still your vision</p>
<p t="1924160" d="2440">will fade right out and you won&#39;t be able
to see anything.</p>
<p t="1926600" d="5890">And it&#39;s because the little retinal cells
that are picking up the light get exhausted</p>
<p t="1932490" d="1470">and then so they stop transmitting.</p>
<p t="1933960" d="4090">And so part of the reason you&#39;re zipping your
eyes back and forth is so that different parts</p>
<p t="1938050" d="3470">of your eye can process the scene and it doesn&#39;t
get exhausted.</p>
<p t="1941520" d="5410">And plus, you&#39;re also looking around and you&#39;re
looking at when things move, you know, you</p>
<p t="1946930" d="2630">direct your attention to that, or if someone
makes a gesture.</p>
<p t="1949560" d="6160">And so, you&#39;re actually kind of using your
eyes like tentacles, you know, to check out</p>
<p t="1955720" d="3340">the information that&#39;s coded in the light.</p>
<p t="1959060" d="4090">And even when you hear and that sort of thing
there&#39;s a fair bit of motor activity associated</p>
<p t="1963150" d="3760">with it--you turn your head unconsciously
and there&#39;s all sorts of little motor actions</p>
<p t="1966910" d="4390">in your ear that also help you tune in, and
so those things are tightly associated.</p>
<p t="1971300" d="5520">But roughly speaking, the motor output is
action.</p>
<p t="1976820" d="6040">And then Swanson shows that there are these
layers in the nervous system that go from</p>
<p t="1982860" d="2220">the spinal cord upward.</p>
<p t="1985080" d="4440">The first ones are the somatomotor neuron
pools, and the second are locomotor pattern</p>
<p t="1989520" d="6100">generators, and the third are locomotor pattern
initiators and then the forth are locomotor</p>
<p t="1995620" d="1110">pattern controllers.</p>
<p t="1996730" d="1020">It&#39;s a hierarchy.</p>
<p t="1997750" d="5690">And so, the way to kind of lay Piaget on it,
in some sense, is to think of the somatomotor</p>
<p t="2003440" d="7080">neuron pools as simple actions that can be
implemented automatically.</p>
<p t="2010520" d="5100">And then the locomotor pattern generator has
taken those simple actions and chained them</p>
<p t="2015620" d="8680">into relatively more complex melodies of action,
so kinetic melodies, and then the locomotor</p>
<p t="2024300" d="4860">pattern initiator more or less decides when
those kenetic melodies should be implemented.</p>
<p t="2029160" d="3190">And even that can be unconscious.</p>
<p t="2032350" d="4160">So it&#39;s still at that level of brain organization,
it&#39;s still more or less automatic.</p>
<p t="2036510" d="2630">Even stimulus-response is a way to think about
it.</p>
<p t="2039140" d="5030">And then you go one level higher and that&#39;s
when you get the ability to voluntarily use</p>
<p t="2044170" d="2110">these automated things.</p>
<p t="2046280" d="2829">So I can show you an example of how this works.</p>
<p t="2049109" d="2020">This is called a ballistic movement.</p>
<p t="2051129" d="4470">So, I&#39;m going to take my hand and I&#39;m going
to bring it down really fast right toward</p>
<p t="2055599" d="1330">that edge.</p>
<p t="2056929" d="5070">Okay so--alright now, so that&#39;s very fast
movement.</p>
<p t="2061999" d="5461">Now one of the things that&#39;s cool about that
movement is that I don&#39;t have time, once that</p>
<p t="2067460" d="7449">action starts, it happens so fast that it&#39;s
done by the time that the information about</p>
<p t="2074909" d="3291">that action actually gets to my brain.</p>
<p t="2078200" d="3859">Once I let that go, I can&#39;t control it.</p>
<p t="2082059" d="7080">What I basically am doing is disinhibiting
the motor control systems that I already have</p>
<p t="2089139" d="4361">established in my psychophysiological being.</p>
<p t="2093500" d="4000">I&#39;m disinhibiting one of those and then it
runs automatically.</p>
<p t="2097500" d="5440">And so that&#39;s what you&#39;re doing all the time
when you&#39;re acting in life.</p>
<p t="2102940" d="4429">It&#39;s kind of a neat--I wrote a paper a while
back with an undergraduate student of mine,</p>
<p t="2107369" d="5071">he was a pretty bright character, and we got
invited to do a paper--I got invited to do</p>
<p t="2112440" d="5839">a paper--on free will, and so we were thinking
about free will and, it&#39;s very interesting</p>
<p t="2118279" d="3780">to think about free will in relationship to
these hierarchies because it sort of goes</p>
<p t="2122059" d="5091">like this: it&#39;s that, out there in the future,
you&#39;ve got free will.</p>
<p t="2127150" d="4209">But as the future moves towards the present,
you don&#39;t.</p>
<p t="2131359" d="4831">Once it gets close enough to the present you
have to have initiated something automatic</p>
<p t="2136190" d="1000">that will happen.</p>
<p t="2137190" d="2129">And so I can give you an example.</p>
<p t="2139319" d="5930">People who play the piano very well, they
look ahead of where they&#39;re playing in the</p>
<p t="2145249" d="1000">music.</p>
<p t="2146249" d="2941">Because they know how to do this, they don&#39;t
have to think about it.</p>
<p t="2149190" d="3399">What they have to do is look ahead so that
the part of them that knows how to do this</p>
<p t="2152589" d="1470">gets ready to do it.</p>
<p t="2154059" d="5411">And all of you are experts in that way likely--all
of those of you who drive--you&#39;re also experts</p>
<p t="2159470" d="1000">that way.</p>
<p t="2160470" d="1389">Because when you&#39;re driving, where do you
look?</p>
<p t="2161859" d="5791">If you&#39;re a good driver, on the highway, you
look at least half a second or a second ahead.</p>
<p t="2167650" d="1000">Why?</p>
<p t="2168650" d="3680">Well because 50 feet ahead has already happened.</p>
<p t="2172330" d="4080">Right, it&#39;s too close in time for you to do
anything about it, so basically what you&#39;re</p>
<p t="2176410" d="6879">doing is you&#39;re looking at the road and then
you&#39;re disinhibiting sequences of actions--the</p>
<p t="2183289" d="4711">ones that are going to correspond to what
you want to do with the road most adequately.</p>
<p t="2188000" d="6030">And the closer you get to executing one of
those motor behaviours, the more automated</p>
<p t="2194030" d="1000">it is.</p>
<p t="2195030" d="3739">SO by the time you manifest the action, there&#39;s
no free will there at all.</p>
<p t="2198769" d="3381">But you set it up to be released in some sense.</p>
<p t="2202150" d="6540">So I can say, well, there&#39;s no free will in
that, but there was in deciding to do it at</p>
<p t="2208690" d="1470">that point.</p>
<p t="2210160" d="5060">So and that&#39;s sort of how your automaticity
meets your freedom.</p>
<p t="2215220" d="3349">You&#39;ve got to think about it as something
extending across time.</p>
<p t="2218569" d="12871">Okay, so having established that then we&#39;re
going to get into the neurological localization</p>
<p t="2231440" d="1280">a little bit.</p>
<p t="2232720" d="5160">So you might say, well you collect all these
patterns of behaviour and then you automate</p>
<p t="2237880" d="1209">them into routines.</p>
<p t="2239089" d="5801">I can give you an example, so, for a child,
you know, when a child is first born, if you</p>
<p t="2244890" d="2050">tap on its cheek it&#39;ll go like this.</p>
<p t="2246940" d="3589">It&#39;s called a rooting reflex, and it&#39;ll move
its mouth and tongue.</p>
<p t="2250529" d="3961">Well what it’s doing, roughly speaking,
is its searching for a nipple, and if you</p>
<p t="2254490" d="3799">just put your finger there it&#39;ll clamp onto
that and start to suck.</p>
<p t="2258289" d="2970">And so the child comes out with that ability.</p>
<p t="2261259" d="3360">And that&#39;s a reflex, it&#39;s sort of built into
the neurology.</p>
<p t="2264619" d="3811">But then when the child starts to interact
with the mother to actually breastfeed, well</p>
<p t="2268430" d="7089">then that initial reflex has to be modified
quite substantially in the context of the</p>
<p t="2275519" d="4340">relationship with the mother because the bare
reflex, it&#39;s enough to get the thing going</p>
<p t="2279859" d="2010">but it&#39;s not enough to make it work.</p>
<p t="2281869" d="4690">And so often mothers take a fair bit of time
to learn how to breastfeed, but it&#39;s also</p>
<p t="2286559" d="2901">because the baby is taking a fair bit of time
to learn how to do it.</p>
<p t="2289460" d="3940">So they have to establish the dance that goes
with that.</p>
<p t="2293400" d="5090">And one of the things that&#39;s quite cool about
that dance, so to speak, is there&#39;s been studies</p>
<p t="2298490" d="4309">done of depressed and non-depressed mothers
interacting with their infants.</p>
<p t="2302799" d="5050">And so if you take a non-depressed mother
interacting with her infant and you just film</p>
<p t="2307849" d="5520">them, and you speed up the film, you can see
the baby reacts and the mother reacts and</p>
<p t="2313369" d="2531">the baby reacts and the mother reacts and
it&#39;s like a dance, you know, there&#39;s this</p>
<p t="2315900" d="3250">continual flow of information between the
two of them.</p>
<p t="2319150" d="3159">And if the baby&#39;s with a depressed mother
that doesn&#39;t happen.</p>
<p t="2322309" d="2921">It&#39;s jerky and discontinuous.</p>
<p t="2325230" d="5450">And so if you think about that you can see
how the dialectical interaction between the</p>
<p t="2330680" d="7370">mother and child is building up the child&#39;s
repertoire of complex abilities--within a</p>
<p t="2338050" d="1779">social context.</p>
<p t="2339829" d="6460">I know I told you guys before, roughly speaking,
that kids really get socialized to play with</p>
<p t="2346289" d="3240">each other between two and four.</p>
<p t="2349529" d="6220">But that&#39;s not exactly true because even at
the lower level, more automated, and more</p>
<p t="2355749" d="6191">primordial reflex behaviours, like the ones
that are associated with breastfeeding, even</p>
<p t="2361940" d="4580">those develop under the constraints of social
guidelines.</p>
<p t="2366520" d="4410">So society&#39;s always there, right from the
reflex level up.</p>
<p t="2370930" d="4950">But you know what happens when kids are between
two and four, they have to learn to actually</p>
<p t="2375880" d="5709">play, they have to learn how to play complex
games with other children and so that involves</p>
<p t="2381589" d="4020">communication and negotiation at a verbal
level.</p>
<p t="2385609" d="2031">And also with people their own age.</p>
<p t="2387640" d="5520">So you know, it&#39;s continuous in some sense
and discontinuous in another sense.</p>
<p t="2393160" d="4770">Okay so anyways, you might say well why do
you bother stringing all these things together,</p>
<p t="2397930" d="2419">and well, you think about the breastfeeding
issue.</p>
<p t="2400349" d="1921">Why does a baby bother to learn how to breastfeed?</p>
<p t="2402270" d="2089">Well, that&#39;s pretty obvious isn&#39;t it.</p>
<p t="2404359" d="4670">I mean, first of all, if it doesn’t then
it doesn&#39;t live.</p>
<p t="2409029" d="4131">And there&#39;s a bunch of reasons for that--one
is obviously it&#39;s not going to be nourished</p>
<p t="2413160" d="4050">properly, although, there are things you can
do to substitute for that.</p>
<p t="2417210" d="4270">Although still, breastfeeding still seems
to be the best thing you can do for your baby.</p>
<p t="2421480" d="4930">Although, you can work around it, but fundamentally
it seems to be the best thing you can do.</p>
<p t="2426410" d="3470">But then the baby&#39;s also learning all sorts
of other things, like it&#39;s got skin-to-skin</p>
<p t="2429880" d="5000">contact and it&#39;s snuggling and it being comforted
and doing eye gaze to eye gaze and it&#39;s cooing</p>
<p t="2434880" d="4189">and the mother&#39;s imitating it and there&#39;s
just a lot of things going on there.</p>
<p t="2439069" d="6520">And so the child is organizing all that, partly
to fulfill a basic biological need, which</p>
<p t="2445589" d="4611">is two needs, both thirst and hunger, but
it’s also fulfilling its need for play,</p>
<p t="2450200" d="3120">for example, because children have a circuit
for play.</p>
<p t="2453320" d="4860">So you could say play is part of the id--it&#39;s
a fundamental biological need.</p>
<p t="2458180" d="7149">The other thing children have to have is skin-to-skin
touch--they&#39;ll die without it, it&#39;s not optional.</p>
<p t="2465329" d="1931">You even see that in rats.</p>
<p t="2467260" d="4579">So if you take a rat pup away from its mother
and you feed it, but you don&#39;t do anything</p>
<p t="2471839" d="1121">with it, it just dies.</p>
<p t="2472960" d="5309">It goes into opiate overdose roughly speaking--its
gastrointestinal systems shut down--and then</p>
<p t="2478269" d="1000">it dies.</p>
<p t="2479269" d="4991">And you can stop that from happening by isolating
it, feeding it, and then like massaging it</p>
<p t="2484260" d="5250">with the eraser end of the pencil--you can
keep the rat pup alive.</p>
<p t="2489510" d="5340">And Jaak Panksepp was one of the people either
discovered that or worked on it, and that</p>
<p t="2494850" d="6989">word was extended by Tiffany Fields in a hospital
in Florida--some really brilliant work.</p>
<p t="2501839" d="5970">She was looking at Panksepp&#39;s work on the
necessity of tactile stimulation and she thought,</p>
<p t="2507809" d="2401">hey I bet we could try that with premature
babies.</p>
<p t="2510210" d="3629">Because if a baby&#39;s premature, a couple of
things are problems.</p>
<p t="2513839" d="4551">I mean, first of all, at the need of the term,
pregnancy term, that&#39;s when babies lay on</p>
<p t="2518390" d="1000">fat.</p>
<p t="2519390" d="4889">You know, so they come out and they&#39;ve got
some storage there in case things don&#39;t get</p>
<p t="2524279" d="1621">going very well.</p>
<p t="2525900" d="3379">And they&#39;re gaining a lot of weight in that
last period of pregnancy, so if they come</p>
<p t="2529279" d="2941">out premature then they&#39;re really skinny.</p>
<p t="2532220" d="3730">And then what happens often is they start
to lose weight and that&#39;s not good because</p>
<p t="2535950" d="2409">they should be ramping up the weight gain
really quickly.</p>
<p t="2538359" d="5821">A newborn baby will outgrow its clothes in
one week, you know, they&#39;re gaining weight</p>
<p t="2544180" d="1000">quickly.</p>
<p t="2545180" d="3730">The premature babies lose weight, and it&#39;s
hard to keep them going.</p>
<p t="2548910" d="5619">They put them in an incubator, they feed them,
but what Tiffany Field did was, she had the</p>
<p t="2554529" d="6540">nurses go in there with gloves and massage
the babies for three minutes ten times a day.</p>
<p t="2561069" d="4821">And those babies gained weight as fast as
babies that were still in utero and you could</p>
<p t="2565890" d="3580">still detect the differences in their development
six weeks later.</p>
<p t="2569470" d="2220">Which in baby terms is like forever, right.</p>
<p t="2571690" d="4000">I mean you change as much from zero months
to six months as you probably do from six</p>
<p t="2575690" d="1919">months to 20 years old.</p>
<p t="2577609" d="2490">It&#39;s such a radical transformation.</p>
<p t="2580099" d="6230">Okay, the reason I&#39;m telling you all this
is because, you lay out these hierarchies</p>
<p t="2586329" d="5540">of behaviour that are well practiced and automatized
and brought under the control of social conditioning,</p>
<p t="2591869" d="5720">but you really do them in the service of--well
that&#39;s the question.</p>
<p t="2597589" d="4121">In the service of, we&#39;ll say, biological necessity,
for the sake of argument.</p>
<p t="2601710" d="4530">Well you have to eat and you have to drink,
and so one of the reasons you lay out the</p>
<p t="2606240" d="5549">hierarchy that&#39;s associated with breastfeeding
is so that you can do that directly, but also</p>
<p t="2611789" d="4441">so that you can establish a relationship so
that not only are you doing it directly this</p>
<p t="2616230" d="5029">day, but you&#39;re also going to do it tomorrow
and the next day and the day after that.</p>
<p t="2621259" d="6981">And so the hunger system is integrated with
these other systems of biological constraint</p>
<p t="2628240" d="5650">in some sense, and they&#39;re trying to come
up with an answer to the continual problem.</p>
<p t="2633890" d="7099">So you have dedicated biological systems that
help you address problems that are associated</p>
<p t="2640989" d="3070">problems that are associated with your biological
nature that are universal.</p>
<p t="2644059" d="2530">And those would be the things that Freud would
describe as the id.</p>
<p t="2646589" d="7641">So you can think of these hierarchies of motor
behaviour, which sort of develop up into sub</p>
<p t="2654230" d="5119">personalities, as nested in some sense inside
of motivational states.</p>
<p t="2659349" d="5081">So there&#39;s the motorbehavious hierarchy that
you use when you&#39;re angry, there&#39;s the motorbehaviour</p>
<p t="2664430" d="5649">hierarchy you use when you&#39;re distressed--and
kids get very good at that, you know, so they&#39;ll</p>
<p t="2670079" d="6391">cry, which is a reflex, but by the time they&#39;re
about two, they&#39;re pretty damn good at crying.</p>
<p t="2676470" d="3789">You know, they&#39;ve got a cry that sounds like
they&#39;re sad and upset when they&#39;re really</p>
<p t="2680259" d="1000">angry.</p>
<p t="2681259" d="2911">And so if you really listen you can hear the
difference.</p>
<p t="2684170" d="4030">Because an angry baby sounds different than
a sad baby.</p>
<p t="2688200" d="3860">But if you don&#39;t listen, the baby will have
you thinking it&#39;s sad no problem.</p>
<p t="2692060" d="3670">Then you&#39;ll feel sorry for it and go help
it out, and really it&#39;s just thinking &quot;up</p>
<p t="2695730" d="1589">yours&quot; [Student laughter].</p>
<p t="2697319" d="6050">So we know this partly because--so let&#39;s say
you&#39;ve got a baby and it&#39;s under nine months,</p>
<p t="2703369" d="2071">six months old, and it&#39;s crying in its crib.</p>
<p t="2705440" d="1569">You think, well what should you do?</p>
<p t="2707009" d="3461">You go in there and you pick up the baby and
you comfort it and you probably do that pretty</p>
<p t="2710470" d="4220">much non-stop when the baby&#39;s that young because
they&#39;re so young they should really still</p>
<p t="2714690" d="2220">be in utero--they&#39;re very young.</p>
<p t="2716910" d="3149">But by nine months that baby&#39;s starting to
get smart.</p>
<p t="2720059" d="5591">And so it&#39;s about nine months when it can
visually recognize people it knows and people</p>
<p t="2725650" d="2370">he/she doesn’t know.</p>
<p t="2728020" d="5339">And then, so the baby&#39;s in there and it&#39;s
squawking a bit and so, it wants some attention,</p>
<p t="2733359" d="2450">and then someone walks in and it&#39;s not the
mother.</p>
<p t="2735809" d="4060">And the baby bursts into tears and people
think the baby&#39;s all sad because its mother</p>
<p t="2739869" d="1000">didn&#39;t show up.</p>
<p t="2740869" d="4321">It&#39;s not sad, it&#39;s really irritated that the
wrong person showed up.</p>
<p t="2745190" d="4649">And you can tell that because people have
done facial coding of the baby&#39;s expression</p>
<p t="2749839" d="3210">and also its skin tone and an angry baby looks
angry.</p>
<p t="2753049" d="3331">First of all it turns all red, it&#39;s really
angry.</p>
<p t="2756380" d="3300">And you see that behaviour later too in temper
tantrums.</p>
<p t="2759680" d="5839">Like a two year old that&#39;s having a temper
tantrum is just having a fit of rage.</p>
<p t="2765519" d="4861">The rage system, because there is a rage system,
is just completely out of control, it&#39;s just</p>
<p t="2770380" d="2820">absolutely dominating their behaviour.</p>
<p t="2773200" d="4869">You don&#39;t really want to encourage that because
the rage system should start to be modulated</p>
<p t="2778069" d="3690">by other systems and other higher order control
systems.</p>
<p t="2781759" d="4451">Not so much suppressed or repressed which
is sort of how the Freudians would think , but</p>
<p t="2786210" d="5069">integrated into more complex and sophisticated
modes of action, so the child can use its</p>
<p t="2791279" d="5590">anger--which is an extraordinarily useful
capacity, because it allows you to defend</p>
<p t="2796869" d="4200">yourself--so the child can learn to use that
in a sophisticated way so it can solve the</p>
<p t="2801069" d="4990">problems that would lead to a rage attack
without ever getting to the point where it</p>
<p t="2806059" d="1720">has to be enraged.</p>
<p t="2807779" d="3300">That&#39;s a functional child--it&#39;s not like it&#39;s
learned to repress its anger, it&#39;s just that</p>
<p t="2811079" d="2980">it gets along with people and never has to
get angry.</p>
<p t="2814059" d="7221">So, now some kids learn to repress their anger
because they&#39;re in a household where any manifestation</p>
<p t="2821280" d="3009">of anger is dealt with very very harshly.</p>
<p t="2824289" d="5101">And maybe there&#39;s a rule that everyone has
to be nice to each other all the time, or</p>
<p t="2829390" d="1000">else.</p>
<p t="2830390" d="2159">Sort of a paradoxical rule.</p>
<p t="2832549" d="4570">But anyways, you can imagine there&#39;s a lot
of these biological systems and so I want</p>
<p t="2837119" d="6051">to show you some of their instantiation here,
so let&#39;s look at this one.</p>
<p t="2843170" d="6199">When you get up above the spinal cord, there&#39;s
a little brain area, I&#39;ll show you about how</p>
<p t="2849369" d="1271">big it is.</p>
<p t="2850640" d="1000">There it is.</p>
<p t="2851640" d="5900">So there&#39;s your brain, the top-on part, the
part on top, that&#39;s the cerebral cortex.</p>
<p t="2857540" d="2229">That&#39;s the part that people are really proud
of.</p>
<p t="2859769" d="2221">It&#39;s like, oh wow, look at our cerebral cortex.</p>
<p t="2861990" d="3059">Doesn&#39;t it have a lot of neurons [student
laughter].</p>
<p t="2865049" d="5471">Then, in the middle there, there are older
brain area--phylogenetically old--and then</p>
<p t="2870520" d="3310">as you go down toward the spinal cord they
basically get older and older and older and</p>
<p t="2873830" d="1669">older.</p>
<p t="2875499" d="3770">And more and more critical to your development.</p>
<p t="2879269" d="4530">So the serotonin system, we talked about it
a little bit in lobsters, right.</p>
<p t="2883799" d="4750">The serotonin system determines where a lobster
is in a dominance hierarchy, it determines</p>
<p t="2888549" d="3280">whether it stands like this or whether it
stands like this.</p>
<p t="2891829" d="1040">That&#39;s an old system.</p>
<p t="2892869" d="4740">And when your brain is developing in utero
it&#39;s the serotonin system that guides its</p>
<p t="2897609" d="1000">development.</p>
<p t="2898609" d="3591">So that&#39;s how important it is, sort of like
the conductor of the orchestra, but it&#39;s also</p>
<p t="2902200" d="4760">the thing that controls the entire unfolding
of the brain.</p>
<p t="2906960" d="9240">And it&#39;s a really really archaic system, so
in some sense your being is controlled by</p>
<p t="2916200" d="2309">these things that are ancient, beyond comprehension.</p>
<p t="2918509" d="5760">Anyways, you look at the hypothalamus and
you think, well that&#39;s not very big.</p>
<p t="2924269" d="2161">And yeah, it&#39;s not.</p>
<p t="2926430" d="6069">But, if you take a cat and you--so a cat brain
looks something like that--if you take off</p>
<p t="2932499" d="5141">all the stuff that&#39;s in light orange and most
of the top of the stuff that&#39;s above the hypothalamus</p>
<p t="2937640" d="5149">that&#39;s in white--you just take all that out,
and it&#39;s a female cat and it&#39;s in a cage--you</p>
<p t="2942789" d="4730">really can&#39;t tell the difference between it
and a cat that has all the rest of that brain.</p>
<p t="2947519" d="2171">Now there&#39;s some things it can&#39;t do.</p>
<p t="2949690" d="4889">It doesn&#39;t do very well if you take it into
a new situation because it can&#39;t learn.</p>
<p t="2954579" d="3471">More importantly in some sense, it can&#39;t remember.</p>
<p t="2958050" d="4759">So it&#39;s in a perpetual sense of everything
happening for the very first time.</p>
<p t="2962809" d="4631">But it&#39;s still capable of a lot of the reactions
that would be necessary for you to stay alive.</p>
<p t="2967440" d="5490">SO it can regulate its liquid intake, it can
regulate its food intake, it can react sexually,</p>
<p t="2972930" d="4059">it&#39;s capable of defensive aggression, although
it&#39;ll really fly into a rage so it&#39;s kind</p>
<p t="2976989" d="3990">of like a disinhibited two year old in some
sense.</p>
<p t="2980979" d="4300">And as long as you keep it in the cage and
provide it with food and water it&#39;s like the</p>
<p t="2985279" d="1950">way it lives.</p>
<p t="2987229" d="3760">And it&#39;s hyper exploratory which I think is
just weird beyond belief.</p>
<p t="2990989" d="3811">You know, you take the brain off a cat and
then all it wants to do is explore.</p>
<p t="2994800" d="1429">Which is not what you think at all.</p>
<p t="2996229" d="5070">It&#39;s like, a cat with no brain is really curious--it
just doesn&#39;t make sense.</p>
<p t="3001299" d="5440">But it does actually because the systems that
drive your exploratory urge are rooted in</p>
<p t="3006739" d="7001">that hypothalamus and they&#39;re actually the
same systems--it&#39;s individual differences</p>
<p t="3013740" d="4640">in the functions and sensitivity of those
systems that are in part associated with individual</p>
<p t="3018380" d="1919">differences in extraversion.</p>
<p t="3020299" d="3621">So extroverts are sort of hyper exploratory
in social situations.</p>
<p t="3023920" d="1620">Whereas introverts aren&#39;t.</p>
<p t="3025540" d="6880">And the exploratory circuit that has its origins
in the hypothalamus runs on dopamine, roughly</p>
<p t="3032420" d="4889">speaking, and then it runs through the base
of your brain and then up into your prefrontal</p>
<p t="3037309" d="1661">cortex in particular.</p>
<p t="3038970" d="4690">And it&#39;s also the system that responds to
cocaine and amphetamines and other drugs that</p>
<p t="3043660" d="3540">people like to take because they heighten
positive emotion.</p>
<p t="3047200" d="6589">So it&#39;s variability at a very very low level
in the brain that determines things like the</p>
<p t="3053789" d="1540">differences in extraverts and introverts.</p>
<p t="3055329" d="7681">Anyways, it&#39;s this tiny little part of the
brain and if that&#39;s all you have you can get</p>
<p t="3063010" d="3370">along not too bad.</p>
<p t="3066380" d="4699">But that&#39;s also because it&#39;s tiny from one
level of analysis, but it&#39;s really big from</p>
<p t="3071079" d="1540">another.</p>
<p t="3072619" d="6511">I mean, you can increase your resolution when
you&#39;re doing brain analysis all the way down</p>
<p t="3079130" d="4199">to the molecular level and still be looking
at the brain, you know.</p>
<p t="3083329" d="5410">Below the molecular level, at the atomic level,
well everything&#39;s made out of atoms.</p>
<p t="3088739" d="5060">But the brain is already there at a molecular
level and it&#39;s insanely complicated at a molecular</p>
<p t="3093799" d="4540">level, and the hypothalamus is way bigger
than a molecule.</p>
<p t="3098339" d="4691">And so even though it&#39;s small compared to
the rest of our brain it&#39;s still a whopping</p>
<p t="3103030" d="4049">big structure by atomic standards and so there&#39;s
a hell of a lot going on down there.</p>
<p t="3107079" d="6030">And you notice the hypothalamus, you might
say, is there such a thing as the id.</p>
<p t="3113109" d="3220">Well, yes and no.</p>
<p t="3116329" d="1301">Is it in the brain?</p>
<p t="3117630" d="1349">Yes and no.</p>
<p t="3118979" d="5100">A really low resolution representation of
what&#39;s in the brain, that&#39;s one way of thinking</p>
<p t="3124079" d="1000">about it.</p>
<p t="3125079" d="2811">But then you might say, is there a hypothalamus?</p>
<p t="3127890" d="2159">And the answer to that is, well, yes and no.</p>
<p t="3130049" d="4260">Because there&#39;s the hypothalamic structure,
and you see it&#39;s made out of a bunch of things</p>
<p t="3134309" d="1200">that are different.</p>
<p t="3135509" d="3310">And so you could say, well should you even
group those things together.</p>
<p t="3138819" d="4091">And the answer to that is, it depends on why
you&#39;re grouping them together.</p>
<p t="3142910" d="7720">If it&#39;s useful for some purpose of understanding
or control, to group them together--they&#39;re</p>
<p t="3150630" d="3609">similar in the way that they emerge in the
course of brain development, and they&#39;re roughly</p>
<p t="3154239" d="4651">of the same phylogenetic age--but there&#39;s
lots of reasons to treat them as the same</p>
<p t="3158890" d="1619">and there&#39;s lots of reasons to treat them
as different.</p>
<p t="3160509" d="2600">It depends on what you&#39;re trying to do.</p>
<p t="3163109" d="13301">Anyways, the hypothalamus has all these little
sub-structures that are really in some sense</p>
<p t="3176410" d="3619">at the core of the sub-personalities that
we talked about.</p>
<p t="3180029" d="12881">So, for example--okay so this is Swanson again
and he&#39;s showing you--this is a rat&#39;s brain</p>
<p t="3192910" d="3949">from the bottom--and he&#39;s showing you the
layout of the hypothalamus.</p>
<p t="3196859" d="2311">You see it&#39;s got all those different nuclei.</p>
<p t="3199170" d="2879">It doesn&#39;t look like one thing, it looks like
a bunch of things.</p>
<p t="3202049" d="8070">And so here he says, the descending paraventricular
nucleus is involved in the control of eating</p>
<p t="3210119" d="3021">and drinking, and that&#39;s shown in green.</p>
<p t="3213140" d="4359">So that&#39;s the thing that--when you get hungry
or thirsty--that&#39;s the thing that sort of</p>
<p t="3217499" d="3391">turns on your hungry and thirsty sub-personality.</p>
<p t="3220890" d="4379">And then the rest of the cell groups play
a major role in controlling two classes of</p>
<p t="3225269" d="4730">social behaviour, that is, behaviours involving
interactions between animals: reproductive--that&#39;s</p>
<p t="3229999" d="5810">the red areas--and defensive--the purplish
areas.</p>
<p t="3235809" d="4651">So now what you can think is, you have all
those little subroutines that we talked about,</p>
<p t="3240460" d="5339">that&#39;re sort of at hand and ready to go, and
then they&#39;re organized underneath these major</p>
<p t="3245799" d="7560">classes of motivation so that, you have to
do something--like eat--and so it&#39;s like there&#39;s</p>
<p t="3253359" d="4031">an eating robot in you, that&#39;s one way of
thinking about it, except it&#39;s smarter than</p>
<p t="3257390" d="2250">that and it&#39;s alive and conscious.</p>
<p t="3259640" d="5889">These things are alive, they&#39;re not machines
and they&#39;re not deterministic.</p>
<p t="3265529" d="5010">You can think of them as low-resolution personalities,
or uni-dimensional personalities because the</p>
<p t="3270539" d="3220">only thing the eating system really cares
about is whether or not you eat.</p>
<p t="3273759" d="2260">And the drinking system is the same thing.</p>
<p t="3276019" d="5020">You know, you see malfunctions sometimes in
people of these singular systems, so you can</p>
<p t="3281039" d="6440">develop a condition if you have hypothalamic
damage where you&#39;ll drink water til you die</p>
<p t="3287479" d="1781">and no one can stop you.</p>
<p t="3289260" d="4469">They can lock you in a room away from sinks
and that would stop you, but you&#39;d be raging</p>
<p t="3293729" d="3850">away inside trying to claw through the door
to get to the damn water because you&#39;re so</p>
<p t="3297579" d="5890">hyper-thirsty that it&#39;s all that there is
left of you in some sense and if you&#39;re allowed</p>
<p t="3303469" d="4890">access to a tap, you&#39;ll just drink and drink
and drink and drink and drink until you drown.</p>
<p t="3308359" d="5510">And, you know, people can say, hey you&#39;ve
had enough water--it&#39;s like, forget that.</p>
<p t="3313869" d="5220">The hypothalamus is a major league system,
and when push comes to shove, it&#39;s the thing</p>
<p t="3319089" d="1450">that&#39;s in control.</p>
<p t="3320539" d="5760">And one of the ways of thinking about the
way that you organize your life is that, the</p>
<p t="3326299" d="3891">hypothalamus controls the major motivation
systems--we just talked about those--and so</p>
<p t="3330190" d="2849">those are the things that people would think
about as drives.</p>
<p t="3333039" d="3240">Although they&#39;re not drives, they&#39;re too complicated
to be drives.</p>
<p t="3336279" d="4540">And then there&#39;s other systems that come up
later that we&#39;ll also talk about that govern</p>
<p t="3340819" d="5831">emotion, like anxiety and a different system
that governs pain.</p>
<p t="3346650" d="3740">Partly what you&#39;re trying to do as your organize
your life is to make sure those systems stay</p>
<p t="3350390" d="1770">shut off.</p>
<p t="3352160" d="1649">And then you think, well I&#39;m in control.</p>
<p t="3353809" d="1511">Well no, you&#39;re not.</p>
<p t="3355320" d="5229">You just satisfied all the things that could
take control from you, and so now you have</p>
<p t="3360549" d="1540">a modicum of choice.</p>
<p t="3362089" d="3670">And basically what you&#39;re doing when all these
things have had what they need is you&#39;re running</p>
<p t="3365759" d="1810">around exploring.</p>
<p t="3367569" d="5101">You know, and that&#39;s also another one of these
circuits because the hypothalamus, as I already</p>
<p t="3372670" d="1449">said, governs exploration.</p>
<p t="3374119" d="9210">So, a lot of--see, psychologists often get
things backwards and they ask silly questions</p>
<p t="3383329" d="1790">like why are people anxious.</p>
<p t="3385119" d="1650">That&#39;s a stupid question.</p>
<p t="3386769" d="4911">It&#39;s why are people ever calm--that&#39;s a question.</p>
<p t="3391680" d="1589">Why are you anxious?</p>
<p t="3393269" d="3121">Well, hmm, think of all the terrible things
that can happen to you.</p>
<p t="3396390" d="3369">And they will happen to you, even worse, and
there isn&#39;t anything you can do about it.</p>
<p t="3399759" d="3251">It&#39;s like why aren&#39;t you quaking in your boots
just sitting there.</p>
<p t="3403010" d="2240">Well, that&#39;s a mystery.</p>
<p t="3405250" d="7269">You know, and then, here you are in your normal
state--it&#39;s like, well no, this is not a normal</p>
<p t="3412519" d="1000">state.</p>
<p t="3413519" d="8490">People have been trying for seven million
years, as people, to create a situation so</p>
<p t="3422009" d="6570">complex and comfortable that a couple hundred
of you can sit here without having your hypothalamus</p>
<p t="3428579" d="4841">driving you toward something and actually
just listen to something for a few hours.</p>
<p t="3433420" d="1449">That&#39;s not normal.</p>
<p t="3434869" d="4990">That&#39;s so staggeringly abnormal that it&#39;s
a miracle.</p>
<p t="3439859" d="6720">The typical person--and for most of human
history--it&#39;s like, you are hungry, man.</p>
<p t="3446579" d="1260">And that&#39;s not the same.</p>
<p t="3447839" d="6371">Like you people--well some of you have probably
been hungry in your life, but--is there someone</p>
<p t="3454210" d="3740">here who&#39;s gone without food for more than
one day?</p>
<p t="3457950" d="3409">Okay has anybody here gone without food for
more than a week.</p>
<p t="3461359" d="4390">Okay, how about three days?</p>
<p t="3465749" d="4771">Okay, so like, are you hungry?</p>
<p t="3470520" d="1000">No.</p>
<p t="3471520" d="4569">You&#39;re hungry when you haven&#39;t had anything
to eat for twenty days, then you&#39;re hungry.</p>
<p t="3476089" d="4561">And the same goes for thirst and cold and
all the things we&#39;re just never exposed to.</p>
<p t="3480650" d="3651">So we think civilized people are all calm
and nice and easy to get along with, it&#39;s</p>
<p t="3484301" d="7808">like, yeah well you have absolutely everything
you need all the time and that makes you as</p>
<p t="3492109" d="4851">easy to get along with as any completely insane
primate ever gets.</p>
<p t="3496960" d="7089">Okay, so you might say, well god, if you can
survive with just the hypothalamus, what good</p>
<p t="3504049" d="1960">is the rest of the brain?</p>
<p t="3506009" d="9991">And the answer is, well, if you&#39;re thirsty--let&#39;s
say you&#39;re angry, the hunger system isn&#39;t</p>
<p t="3516000" d="1730">going to be able to take care of that, right.</p>
<p t="3517730" d="2589">So you&#39;re hungry, okay, that works.</p>
<p t="3520319" d="1831">You&#39;re angry, that works.</p>
<p t="3522150" d="5630">But then you have another problem, which is
you&#39;re hungry now and you&#39;re angry now, perhaps,</p>
<p t="3527780" d="2279">you can move through those states.</p>
<p t="3530059" d="3151">If you watch that, you&#39;ll see that in two
year olds--it&#39;s part of why they&#39;re so fun</p>
<p t="3533210" d="1690">to be around.</p>
<p t="3534900" d="3510">First of all, they&#39;re really excited and they&#39;re
running around playing and then they trip</p>
<p t="3538410" d="3419">and they&#39;re crying like made and then you
poke them and they laugh and then they want</p>
<p t="3541829" d="2311">something to eat and then they fall asleep
[student laughter].</p>
<p t="3544140" d="5060">You know, they&#39;re just run by their hypothalamus
and it&#39;s really fun to see because they&#39;re</p>
<p t="3549200" d="4470">so alive and so enthusiastic and spontaneous,
but they&#39;re completely clueless.</p>
<p t="3553670" d="4730">It&#39;s like, you take one of those creatures
to the mall and leave it there and it&#39;s just</p>
<p t="3558400" d="1659">not happy at all.</p>
<p t="3560059" d="5131">And the reason for that is, well it doesn&#39;t
know how to sequence any of its actions, right.</p>
<p t="3565190" d="5700">It runs through these states of need, but
it isn&#39;t complicated enough to figure out</p>
<p t="3570890" d="6570">how to address those needs in any consistent
sense across multiple environments in a social</p>
<p t="3577460" d="1000">world.</p>
<p t="3578460" d="1810">You need the rest of your brain for that.</p>
<p t="3580270" d="3900">And that again fits in with the Piagetian
idea--is that what you&#39;re doing is you&#39;re</p>
<p t="3584170" d="5949">taking these micropersonalities that are basically
instantiated within the hypothalamus and then</p>
<p t="3590119" d="3311">you&#39;re organizing those into more and more
complex games.</p>
<p t="3593430" d="5409">And you need the cortex to do that because
the cortex is partly what enables you to think</p>
<p t="3598839" d="1980">about time.</p>
<p t="3600819" d="4500">You know, because the hypothalamus, it&#39;s a
here and now thing.</p>
<p t="3605319" d="5311">The hypothalamic cat lives in the present--there&#39;s
the present, and that&#39;s it.</p>
<p t="3610630" d="5110">You can probably get some sense of that--like
one of the things that happens to people if</p>
<p t="3615740" d="6720">they take amphetamines or if they take psychedelic
drugs is that some of the inhibitory control,</p>
<p t="3622460" d="4210">some of the more complex control systems that
are cortical, shut down.</p>
<p t="3626670" d="6270">And so then they enter a state where it&#39;s
all now and you know, the now just comes at</p>
<p t="3632940" d="1379">people in that state.</p>
<p t="3634319" d="5940">It&#39;s a transcendent experience, but of course,
despite that, you&#39;re not functional.</p>
<p t="3640259" d="5971">And so in some sense you trade that transcendent
relationship with reality for a narrow functionality.</p>
<p t="3646230" d="4770">And that&#39;s too bad and that&#39;s life, but it&#39;s
a tradeoff.</p>
<p t="3651000" d="6329">So anyways you&#39;re organizing these sub-personalities
and you&#39;re using your cortex to do that because</p>
<p t="3657329" d="4821">you don&#39;t just have to think about eating,
you have to think about, how am I going to</p>
<p t="3662150" d="1120">get the food?</p>
<p t="3663270" d="1410">When is the food going to come?</p>
<p t="3664680" d="1450">How am I going to cook the food?</p>
<p t="3666130" d="2140">What about all the other people that want
to eat?</p>
<p t="3668270" d="2209">How do we regulate that in our family?</p>
<p t="3670479" d="3120">And then how do we regulate that with the
fact that we also need to sleep and we need</p>
<p t="3673599" d="3270">to work and we need to get along with other
people and we need to have something interesting</p>
<p t="3676869" d="3610">to do and--it&#39;s ridiculously complicated.</p>
<p t="3680479" d="7640">And there&#39;s no end to the complication because,
maybe you&#39;re just solving the problem for</p>
<p t="3688119" d="2341">you, and then you&#39;re two.</p>
<p t="3690460" d="2129">Or maybe you&#39;re trying to work it out within
your family.</p>
<p t="3692589" d="3700">Well then that&#39;s sort of like the Crumb brothers,
they never get out of their family because</p>
<p t="3696289" d="4520">they never come to an arrangement that works
well enough so that they can, in some sense</p>
<p t="3700809" d="1911">move into the broader world.</p>
<p t="3702720" d="4970">Then you solve the family problem but then
you&#39;ve got the tribe problem and, maybe you</p>
<p t="3707690" d="3389">can solve that to some degree, but then you
have the broader political problem and it&#39;s</p>
<p t="3711079" d="5591">like--there&#39;s an infinite problems that crop
up for you to solve so there&#39;s plenty for</p>
<p t="3716670" d="1699">you to do with your big cortex.</p>
<p t="3718369" d="8500">And you know we paid a big price for that
thing because once we discovered time, we</p>
<p t="3726869" d="3380">can make a bargain with the future, which
is basically what you do when you regulate</p>
<p t="3730249" d="1110">your behaviour, right.</p>
<p t="3731359" d="2160">You&#39;re making a bargain with the future.</p>
<p t="3733519" d="8000">You say to yourself, if I forego so and so
now then, later, it&#39;ll pay off.</p>
<p t="3741519" d="1030">And that&#39;s real useful.</p>
<p t="3742549" d="3671">You can conceptualize the future, and you
can conceptualize the future as something</p>
<p t="3746220" d="1720">you can bargain with.</p>
<p t="3747940" d="1570">But there&#39;s a lot of cost to that.</p>
<p t="3749510" d="3979">One is you don&#39;t get to do just what you want
right now, and of course that sucks--it&#39;s</p>
<p t="3753489" d="2961">partly why people drink alcohol.</p>
<p t="3756450" d="4740">Because alcohol is disinhibiting, it stops
you from--it actually doesn&#39;t stop you from</p>
<p t="3761190" d="6029">thinking about the future--it stops you from
caring about what you think about the future.</p>
<p t="3767219" d="1421">And that&#39;s just as good.</p>
<p t="3768640" d="4540">And so then you can go out and have fun because
fun is impulsive and often extremely dangerous,</p>
<p t="3773180" d="4829">because the long term consequences can be
really devastating.</p>
<p t="3778009" d="5691">But it&#39;s a real pain to keep yourself controlled
all the time because you&#39;re foregoing direct</p>
<p t="3783700" d="2149">reward constantly.</p>
<p t="3785849" d="6230">I think it&#39;s part of the reason why people
in heavily industrialized complex countries</p>
<p t="3792079" d="2180">aren&#39;t necessarily happy.</p>
<p t="3794259" d="5350">You know, it takes a lot of grinding away
to keep all the machinery that keeps all of</p>
<p t="3799609" d="1861">this in place going.</p>
<p t="3801470" d="5720">So you&#39;re not getting typhoid and tigers aren&#39;t
tearing you apart, but by the same token,</p>
<p t="3807190" d="5819">you have to be unbelievably disciplined and
ready to act constantly to keep everything</p>
<p t="3813009" d="2070">that&#39;s so complex around you working.</p>
<p t="3815079" d="2500">And that&#39;s not necessarily fun.</p>
<p t="3817579" d="5240">Okay, now, let’s look at something else.</p>
<p t="3822819" d="19680">Now you can tell me if I showed you this--I
hope I didn&#39;t show you this.</p>
<p t="3842499" d="1000">You see that?</p>
<p t="3843499" d="1090">Okay, good.</p>
<p t="3844589" d="4230">Now some of you know this, and so you just
don&#39;t say anything.</p>
<p t="3848819" d="3440">Although you probably don&#39;t know this specific
version.</p>
<p t="3852259" d="3810">So if you&#39;ve seen this sort of thing before
you&#39;re going to think you&#39;re smart while you&#39;re</p>
<p t="3856069" d="16750">watching it, but it&#39;ll probably still trip
you up--I hope.</p>
<p t="3872819" d="102611">Give me a sec here and we&#39;ll see if we can
actually get some sound out of this thing.</p>
<p t="3975430" d="10510">Yeah, so that&#39;s quite the illustration.</p>
<p t="3985940" d="6970">So one of the questions you might ask is,
well okay first of all, how many of you didn&#39;t</p>
<p t="3992910" d="1689">see the gorilla?</p>
<p t="3994599" d="3520">Okay, how many of you have seen this sort
of video before?</p>
<p t="3998119" d="1990">Okay so you knew about the damn gorilla [student
laughter].</p>
<p t="4000109" d="4811">Of the people who didn&#39;t know about the gorilla,
how many people didn&#39;t see the gorilla.</p>
<p t="4004920" d="1339">Well, some.</p>
<p t="4006259" d="1350">Okay, fine.</p>
<p t="4007609" d="3220">How many of you got the other things?</p>
<p t="4010829" d="1400">Both of them?</p>
<p t="4012229" d="2260">Okay, well so you get the point.</p>
<p t="4014489" d="6800">The point is--and it&#39;s a brilliant experiment,
it&#39;s an insanely brilliant experiment--that</p>
<p t="4021289" d="4210">you&#39;re blind to a ridiculous degree.</p>
<p t="4025499" d="5600">And your visual system and your brain are
constantly coping with the fact that you&#39;re</p>
<p t="4031099" d="1000">blind.</p>
<p t="4032099" d="4370">And you can kind of detect it to some degree
if you look at someone, but you pay attention</p>
<p t="4036469" d="4260">to the things that surround them, you&#39;ll see
that--so, I&#39;m looking at you.</p>
<p t="4040729" d="3411">I can&#39;t see your nose for sure, it&#39;s gone.</p>
<p t="4044140" d="1959">I can’t even see your face.</p>
<p t="4046099" d="2450">I can see your glasses.</p>
<p t="4048549" d="1270">I can&#39;t see any features in your face at all.</p>
<p t="4049819" d="1000">Can you smile?</p>
<p t="4050819" d="6461">No, the one behind.</p>
<p t="4057280" d="4000">Well one of the things I&#39;ve noticed when doing
this is that if you look here--look at my</p>
<p t="4061280" d="3519">finger--but pay attention to my face, it&#39;s
really hard.</p>
<p t="4064799" d="3250">Because normally when you pay attention you
move your eyes to what you&#39;re paying attention</p>
<p t="4068049" d="1000">to.</p>
<p t="4069049" d="3320">Okay so here&#39;s what you might see--the first
thing you might see is that you can&#39;t see</p>
<p t="4072369" d="1841">my nose [student laughter].</p>
<p t="4074210" d="4659">The second thing you might see is that you
can really see my eyes, especially if they</p>
<p t="4078869" d="2190">move [uproar of student laughter].</p>
<p t="4081059" d="1000">Weird eh?</p>
<p t="4082059" d="1200">Isn&#39;t that weird?</p>
<p t="4083259" d="1392">God, it&#39;s so weird.</p>
<p t="4084651" d="5628">It&#39;s like all of a sudden these eyes pop up
and they&#39;re going back and forth like this.</p>
<p t="4090279" d="1000">Yeah, so we&#39;ll try this too.</p>
<p t="4091279" d="4220">So look at my finger again.</p>
<p t="4095499" d="1151">You can also see teeth.</p>
<p t="4096650" d="1250">Well, why?</p>
<p t="4097900" d="3840">Well, if you&#39;re looking here and there&#39;s something
there with eyes and teeth, you should probably</p>
<p t="4101740" d="1499">be able to see it right?</p>
<p t="4103239" d="4131">So what that basically means is that you&#39;ve
got this tiny little fovea, which is right</p>
<p t="4107370" d="5729">in the centre of your retina, it&#39;s just densely
packed with cells and then those cells transmit</p>
<p t="4113099" d="4541">information along the optic nerve, and they&#39;re
just connected like mad to cells in the visual</p>
<p t="4117640" d="1199">cortex.</p>
<p t="4118839" d="4360">But you don&#39;t have that much room, so you
can&#39;t connect all the cells in your retina</p>
<p t="4123199" d="2771">to like 10,000 cells at the first level of
connection.</p>
<p t="4125970" d="3250">You&#39;d have to have a brain this big you know,
and you don&#39;t.</p>
<p t="4129220" d="5280">So you get by, and part of the way you get
by is you&#39;re always moving your eyes around.</p>
<p t="4134500" d="2859">And so it looks like you can see everything,
but you can&#39;t.</p>
<p t="4137359" d="5451">In fact, out here, like if I&#39;m looking at
you--now I can tell my hands are there, although</p>
<p t="4142810" d="5250">if I didn&#39;t know they were hands I probably
couldn&#39;t figure it out--they&#39;re kinda blurry</p>
<p t="4148060" d="1769">I would say.</p>
<p t="4149829" d="2950">And they&#39;re in black and white, but I can&#39;t
tell that.</p>
<p t="4152779" d="3601">So out here, who cares what colour it is.</p>
<p t="4156380" d="1189">So you just don&#39;t see the colour.</p>
<p t="4157569" d="1880">But you don&#39;t know that you don&#39;t see the
colour.</p>
<p t="4159449" d="4370">Now of course, I can have my hands here, and
then I put them here--I can hardly see them--and</p>
<p t="4163819" d="1800">then oop, they&#39;re gone.</p>
<p t="4165619" d="2011">They&#39;re so gone it&#39;s like they don&#39;t even
exist.</p>
<p t="4167630" d="4250">It&#39;s not even--because you&#39;d think in some
sense that what is behind your head would</p>
<p t="4171880" d="4169">be black, like when you close your eyes, that&#39;s
nothing.</p>
<p t="4176049" d="9020">But no no, what you can&#39;t see behind your
head is so not there that it&#39;s literally--it</p>
<p t="4185069" d="3371">isn&#39;t even not there, that&#39;s how gone it is.</p>
<p t="4188440" d="7070">Okay, so part of the way your eyes work is
that the periphery is attached to devices,</p>
<p t="4195510" d="4729">in some sense, and some of them detect lines
and some of them detect movement.</p>
<p t="4200239" d="1500">You remember Jurassic Park?</p>
<p t="4201739" d="1261">&quot;Don&#39;t move.</p>
<p t="4203000" d="2590">The dinosaur can&#39;t see you unless you move.&quot;</p>
<p t="4205590" d="2730">It&#39;s like, yeah, frogs are like that.</p>
<p t="4208320" d="1550">And cats are like that to some degree.</p>
<p t="4209870" d="2150">They can really see things move this way.</p>
<p t="4212020" d="4880">Partly because their eyes are slitted, makes
it easier for them to see things moving like</p>
<p t="4216900" d="1000">this.</p>
<p t="4217900" d="1000">They&#39;re not so good at things moving like
this.</p>
<p t="4218900" d="2969">Well, it&#39;s because they chase mice, right.</p>
<p t="4221869" d="4321">Mice will--most mice, except ones that hop
[student laughter]--they move this way, and</p>
<p t="4226190" d="2230">so cats are specialized for that.</p>
<p t="4228420" d="5440">And so you&#39;re also specialized to see teeth
and eyes because you want to know if something&#39;s</p>
<p t="4233860" d="2950">looking at you, and you want to know if it
has teeth.</p>
<p t="4236810" d="6200">And so what that means in part is that the
surrounding tissue in your eyes reports to</p>
<p t="4243010" d="4950">some degree to your visual cortex, which is
what you use to actually have conscious vision</p>
<p t="4247960" d="3850">with, but a lot of it just dumps down into
some of the brain areas we haven&#39;t talked</p>
<p t="4251810" d="1000">about.</p>
<p t="4252810" d="5170">Not necessarily directly down to the hypothalamus,
although I suspect it has inputs there, I</p>
<p t="4257980" d="1090">just don&#39;t know.</p>
<p t="4259070" d="5669">But your eyes talk to your spinal cord directly,
so that you can see something snake-like,</p>
<p t="4264739" d="1291">for example, and jump.</p>
<p t="4266030" d="3440">Just like you jump if your hand touches a
hot stove.</p>
<p t="4269470" d="2870">You don&#39;t even see the snake, it&#39;s like snake-jump.</p>
<p t="4272340" d="3001">And the reason for that is if you wait around
to see the snake, it&#39;s like it&#39;s bitten you</p>
<p t="4275341" d="1559">15 times and you&#39;re dead.</p>
<p t="4276900" d="2880">So you can&#39;t wait around and see this, like
&quot;oh look.</p>
<p t="4279780" d="1690">A snake.&quot;</p>
<p t="4281470" d="1000">And then you jump.</p>
<p t="4282470" d="1000">It&#39;s like, no.</p>
<p t="4283470" d="2260">That doesn&#39;t work.</p>
<p t="4285730" d="5560">Your body has conserved all these layers of
reflex and movement, all the way up to higher</p>
<p t="4291290" d="3949">order voluntary movement, because otherwise
you just wouldn&#39;t be fast enough when something</p>
<p t="4295239" d="1521">super fast happens.</p>
<p t="4296760" d="4290">And then, the way your eyes are built, your
eyes can tell your body to jump.</p>
<p t="4301050" d="1730">It&#39;s no vision, right.</p>
<p t="4302780" d="1090">It&#39;s just pattern.</p>
<p t="4303870" d="1750">Snake-pattern, jump-pattern.</p>
<p t="4305620" d="4590">Snake-pattern, retinal-pattern, optic-nerve
pattern, brain-pattern, muscle-pattern.</p>
<p t="4310210" d="1320">No vision.</p>
<p t="4311530" d="1320">No seeing.</p>
<p t="4312850" d="1530">Because you don&#39;t need the seeing.</p>
<p t="4314380" d="2750">You just have to do pattern matching.</p>
<p t="4317130" d="3271">It&#39;s a weird way of thinking about it, but
it&#39;s not much different than touching, you</p>
<p t="4320401" d="1349">know.</p>
<p t="4321750" d="4850">You can feel the pattern, you can build a
three-dimensional representation of it, you</p>
<p t="4326600" d="3520">can really see well with your eyes--it&#39;s like
the idea that blind people can&#39;t see is a</p>
<p t="4330120" d="1010">really dopey idea.</p>
<p t="4331130" d="1560">They can&#39;t see colour.</p>
<p t="4332690" d="2820">And they&#39;re not very good at detecting things
in the distance.</p>
<p t="4335510" d="3800">But they have a visual world, it&#39;s just built
out of things that don&#39;t have colour.</p>
<p t="4339310" d="5010">You know perfectly well that that&#39;s the case
because I can hand you an object and you could</p>
<p t="4344320" d="3750">fiddle around with it behind your back and
after some fiddling around you&#39;d know exactly</p>
<p t="4348070" d="1550">what it looked like.</p>
<p t="4349620" d="3619">And you know you might pull it out here and
say , well I didn&#39;t know it was blue.</p>
<p t="4353239" d="4001">It&#39;s like, yeah okay, you didn&#39;t know it was
blue, but you still saw it.</p>
<p t="4357240" d="3470">And you get pretty god-damn good vision with
your ears.</p>
<p t="4360710" d="3449">So there are kids who&#39;re blind who&#39;ve learned
to echolocate.</p>
<p t="4364159" d="4341">So they go click-click-click, they don&#39;t make
that noise exactly, but they do click [clicking</p>
<p t="4368500" d="3530">sounds] and they can detect the clicks bouncing
off of things.</p>
<p t="4372030" d="2930">And they can do that well enough, not only
to walk, but some of them can actually ride</p>
<p t="4374960" d="1250">bikes.</p>
<p t="4376210" d="4710">It&#39;s like, hey that&#39;s impressive, man.</p>
<p t="4380920" d="4960">Yeah, there&#39;s one kid--I saw a kid on youtube
who&#39;s blind who could shoot baskets, yeah,</p>
<p t="4385880" d="2480">which is--that&#39;s impressive, man.</p>
<p t="4388360" d="6080">But my point is that a lot of the neural tissue
is--it&#39;ll take whatever input it gets.</p>
<p t="4394440" d="5730">So if you&#39;re born blind, your auditory systems
will invade your visual system.</p>
<p t="4400170" d="3069">And then you have twice as much brain devoted
to your hearing.</p>
<p t="4403239" d="3031">So, and then you know, you can use that quite
effectively.</p>
<p t="4406270" d="4550">So I think we&#39;re probably pretty much out
of time.</p>
<p t="4410820" d="3339">One thing I want to tell you before we go
on to the next part though is that--so now</p>
<p t="4414159" d="5270">we&#39;ve sort of built up the idea of these underlying
motivational systems.</p>
<p t="4419429" d="6480">And now you can kind of see how they work,
so you might say to yourself, why didn&#39;t you</p>
<p t="4425909" d="3971">see the gorilla and the curtain and the person
leaving.</p>
<p t="4429880" d="2779">It&#39;s really complicated, it&#39;s really complicated.</p>
<p t="4432659" d="6331">Well, the first answer is, you did what I
asked.</p>
<p t="4438990" d="1720">And then you might ask, well why?</p>
<p t="4440710" d="1000">Why did you do what I asked?</p>
<p t="4441710" d="1900">I mean you missed the damn gorilla, right.</p>
<p t="4443610" d="3060">It&#39;s like, obviously that wasn&#39;t a very good
decision.</p>
<p t="4446670" d="2440">So you think, well why did you do what I asked?</p>
<p t="4449110" d="5390">And the answer would be--well, it&#39;s sort of
like the Milgram obedience experiment except</p>
<p t="4454500" d="2110">at a way lower level.</p>
<p t="4456610" d="2650">It&#39;s like, we&#39;ve got an agreement going on
here.</p>
<p t="4459260" d="6040">You guys are all very sophisticated and complex
game players, otherwise you couldn&#39;t sit here</p>
<p t="4465300" d="1820">peacefully for an hour and a half.</p>
<p t="4467120" d="3180">So you&#39;re very well socialized, all of you.</p>
<p t="4470300" d="6050">And so that means you&#39;ve organized all your
motivations into a hierarchy, and that hierarchy</p>
<p t="4476350" d="1310">is guiding your behaviour here.</p>
<p t="4477660" d="3831">It might be something like, well we need to
learn something and hypothetically, you come</p>
<p t="4481491" d="1099">here and you learn something.</p>
<p t="4482590" d="2060">And so you&#39;re playing that out.</p>
<p t="4484650" d="6339">And because that&#39;s the motivational state
that you&#39;re in, when I ask you to do something,</p>
<p t="4490989" d="1421">you&#39;re just going to do it.</p>
<p t="4492410" d="8280">Well then, what&#39;s so cool is that as soon
as you decide to point your attention at something,</p>
<p t="4500690" d="2540">what you see in the world radically transforms.</p>
<p t="4503230" d="4610">So I say, well count the basketballs and all
of a sudden all you can see are basketballs.</p>
<p t="4507840" d="2290">And you think, no no, I see--I&#39;m not blind.</p>
<p t="4510130" d="3250">It&#39;s like well, you&#39;re pretty damn blind.</p>
<p t="4513380" d="6460">And so, that&#39;s partly how you can understand
how motivation is a sub-personality.</p>
<p t="4519840" d="2220">Like it has its whole sets of perceptions
and values.</p>
<p t="4522060" d="5119">It&#39;s like, all of a sudden, I set you up in
a little motivated state--it was a complicated</p>
<p t="4527179" d="3201">one--but it was just like, here&#39;s a task.</p>
<p t="4530380" d="4400">And so you&#39;re all motivated, you&#39;re going
to do the task properly, for god only knows</p>
<p t="4534780" d="5310">how many reasons, and then all of a sudden,
all that exists in the world are basketballs.</p>
<p t="4540090" d="8730">And so, it&#39;s as if your goal-directed attention
has transformed the phenomenology of the world.</p>
<p t="4548820" d="5230">And that&#39;s something that&#39;s really cool because
one of the things it implies is that what</p>
<p t="4554050" d="3150">you see of the world depends on what you&#39;re
aiming at.</p>
<p t="4557200" d="2690">And in a real sense--this isn&#39;t some trivial
sense.</p>
<p t="4559890" d="4849">It means like literally what you&#39;re aiming
at--I&#39;m going to count the basketballs--it</p>
<p t="4564739" d="2771">means, well you&#39;re not noticing the gorillas.</p>
<p t="4567510" d="3459">So one of the things that you might ask yourself,
and this is partly what the phenomenologists</p>
<p t="4570969" d="4020">were on about is, what&#39;re you aiming at?</p>
<p t="4574989" d="5351">And what is it that what you&#39;re aiming at
allows you to see, and what is it that what</p>
<p t="4580340" d="2520">you&#39;re aiming at blinds you to.</p>
<p t="4582860" d="3250">And it blinds you to a lot more than it allows
you to see.</p>
<p t="4586110" d="3589">And so another thing that you can think about
is like, if everything you see makes you angry</p>
<p t="4589699" d="7161">and bitter and resentful, you might think,
well hmm, what exactly am I aiming at that&#39;s</p>
<p t="4596860" d="2690">making the world organize itself around me
in that manner?</p>
<p t="4599550" d="5700">And that would be a complex, for a Jungian
perspective.</p>
<p t="4605250" d="1329">A complex would do that.</p>
<p t="4606579" d="4421">So it&#39;s a set of values, they&#39;re sort of economist,
they inhabit you, it&#39;s a sub-personality,</p>
<p t="4611000" d="3199">it&#39;s quite complex, it&#39;s got something it&#39;s
aiming at.</p>
<p t="4614199" d="3861">You might not even know what that is because
you&#39;re acting it out instead of understanding</p>
<p t="4618060" d="1000">it.</p>
<p t="4619060" d="4800">And because you&#39;re inside of it, it lays the
world out for you in a particular way that</p>
<p t="4623860" d="4819">makes the world look like it&#39;s showing you
that what you think is right.</p>
<p t="4628679" d="6621">But if you&#39;re--what do they say-- to the man
with a hammer, everything looks like a nail.</p>
<p t="4635300" d="3770">And that&#39;s one of the things that&#39;s so damn
cool about that experiment.</p>
<p t="4639070" d="1520">It&#39;s like, really?</p>
<p t="4640590" d="1609">I&#39;m really that blind?</p>
<p t="4642199" d="5681">I can miss something that radical just when
I&#39;m involved in some dopey task like counting</p>
<p t="4647880" d="4120">basketballs it makes me so blind that it&#39;s
almost beyond comprehension.</p>
<p t="4652000" d="5280">Well, so in some ways you skip between different
states of blindness.</p>
<p t="4657280" d="2240">A lot of them are biologically motivated.</p>
<p t="4659520" d="4369">And you turn those into a hierarchy and that&#39;s
sort of your higher value system and then</p>
<p t="4663889" d="4341">that thing points you at something, and the
whole world lays itself out around that.</p>
<p t="4668230" d="4630">And the way it does it is divides the world
into irrelevant things--and so those would&#39;ve</p>
<p t="4672860" d="4629">been the curtains in this particular example,
or the gorilla or even the player in black</p>
<p t="4677489" d="4261">who left the game--irrelevant, because it
didn&#39;t interfere with you counting.</p>
<p t="4681750" d="3260">So what you look at makes most of the world
irrelevant.</p>
<p t="4685010" d="2790">It makes some things , things that serve you.</p>
<p t="4687800" d="2310">And that makes you feel positive emotion.</p>
<p t="4690110" d="2379">And it makes other things things that get
in your way.</p>
<p t="4692489" d="2191">And that&#39;s what makes negative emotions.</p>
<p t="4694680" d="4350">And so you&#39;ve got the hypothalamic systems
that point you in biological directions.</p>
<p t="4699030" d="6570">You organize those, and then, as you&#39;re approaching
the things you&#39;re aiming at, the positive</p>
<p t="4705600" d="3749">emotion systems tell you you&#39;re on track and
the negative emotion systems tell you when</p>
<p t="4709349" d="1401">something&#39;s interfering.</p>
<p t="4710750" d="3530">And those are actually different neurological
systems.</p>
<p t="4714280" d="1730">So they&#39;re not in the hypothalamus.</p>
<p t="4716010" d="2689">The positive emotion system is in some degree.</p>
<p t="4718699" d="2851">But the negative emotion system, that evolved
later.</p>
<p t="4721550" d="1000">And there&#39;s a couple of them.</p>
<p t="4722550" d="2620">There&#39;s one that produces pain, we&#39;ll talk
about it more.</p>
<p t="4725170" d="2400">And there&#39;s another one that produces anxiety.</p>
<p t="4727570" d="8280">And so, now you kind of understand--roughly--the
relationship between motivation, perception,</p>
<p t="4735850" d="1220">and emotion.</p>
<p t="4737070" d="2940">They all act together.</p>
<p t="4740010" d="4060">And they&#39;re all dependent in this weird way
on what you&#39;re after.</p>
<p t="4744070" d="3700">So you can think for 50 years and you won&#39;t
get to the bottom of it.</p>
<p t="4747770" d="2250">You know the Buddhists say that everything
is illusion.</p>
<p t="4750020" d="2480">Maya, right, people live in illusion.</p>
<p t="4752500" d="2949">Because what you&#39;re aiming at determines what
you see.</p>
<p t="4755449" d="4071">So, anyways, it&#39;s worth thinking about.</p>
