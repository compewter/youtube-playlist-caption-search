<p t="40" d="600">Hi there.</p>
<p t="1720" d="1660">It&#39;s only about a week before Christmas,</p>
<p t="3380" d="500">*singing* &quot;Tis the season to be jolly and joyus! With a burst of pleasure we feel it alright. Fa la la! It&#39;s the season when the saints can employ us. To spread the news about peace and to keep love alive!&quot;</p>
<p t="3880" d="6000">and some of you are no doubt scrambling to determine what might make an appropriate Christmas gift.</p>
<p t="10280" d="2580">As you may know, or also may not,</p>
<p t="13200" d="4480">I have written a book that&#39;s coming out in January - on January 23rd as a matter of fact,</p>
<p t="17880" d="3200">called &quot;12 Rules for Life, An Antidote to Chaos&quot;.</p>
<p t="21080" d="4280">And it&#39;s possible that some of the people you know might be interested in receiving that as a gift.</p>
<p t="26000" d="5340">However, a promise to get a book a month later doesn&#39;t make a great Christmas gift, exactly.</p>
<p t="31580" d="6640">So what I&#39;ve done is put together a small package that announces that the book has been ordered,</p>
<p t="38420" d="6180">that has a short letter in it from me and also that contains the introduction to the book;</p>
<p t="44820" d="2420">about 10 pages which I called &quot;Overture&quot;.</p>
<p t="47460" d="6020">You could order the book online from any of the vendors to whom I have provided a link in the description of the video.</p>
<p t="53480" d="3360">And you could also download the package I have produced</p>
<p t="56880" d="6700">and print it out to make the gift more tangible and therefor more, well, solid and appreciated I would say.</p>
<p t="63720" d="5440">And then you could put it in an envelope and you can give that little package as a gift.</p>
<p t="69300" d="6080">And maybe that would be more appropriate than a mere indication that the book is on its way.</p>
<p t="75380" d="7440">So, I hope that&#39;s useful. Thank you all for tuning in over the last year and before that.</p>
<p t="82900" d="2740">And for all the support you&#39;ve offered me in the last year.</p>
<p t="86240" d="2640">And Merry Christmas and Happy New Year.</p>
<p t="89780" d="3900">&quot;Tis the season to be jolly and joyous.&quot;</p>
<p t="93840" d="860">&quot;Fa la la!&quot;</p>
<p t="94980" d="3180">&quot;With a burst of pleasure, we feel it all right.&quot;</p>
<p t="98380" d="720">&quot;Fa la la!&quot;</p>
<p t="100240" d="3600">&quot;It&#39;s the season when the saints can employ us.&quot;</p>
<p t="104160" d="720">&quot;Fa la la!&quot;</p>
<p t="105180" d="2820">&quot;To spread the news about peace and to keep love alive...&quot;</p>
