<p t="32860" d="4340">We&#39;ve had written history for 5000 years.</p>
<p t="37200" d="4620">People have been generally literate for less
than 500 years.</p>
<p t="41820" d="5750">But we've had culture for 150,000 years.</p>
<p t="47570" d="7580">Identifiable culture for at least 25,000 so
the vast period of our enculturation was preliterate</p>
<p t="55150" d="4460">enculturation before we could write down the
rules and transmit them.</p>
<p t="59610" d="6330">How were they transmitted assuming we had
culture well there&#39;s a variety of mechanisms.</p>
<p t="65940" d="5280">we have a tendency to see elements of the
world in personified form because most of</p>
<p t="71220" d="4640">the inter relationships we have with the world
are actually social or interpersonal relationships</p>
<p t="75860" d="4440">so that's basically how our brain is structured
and as we evolved we developed the capacity</p>
<p t="80300" d="5380">to extend our cognitive ability beyond the
merely social to take in the world as such</p>
<p t="85680" d="3430">but the categories that we use to do that
was still fundamentally social.</p>
<p t="89110" d="6360">Now the reason the unknown per se is symbolized
as feminine is because the critical feature</p>
<p t="95470" d="4630">of the feminine and I don't mean the female
individual I mean the feminine category is</p>
<p t="100100" d="2930">its capacity to generate new forms.</p>
<p t="103030" d="6250">And the unknown is such is is logically and
appropriately symbolized by the feminine because</p>
<p t="109280" d="5920">it's the bringer forth of all things which
is to say that the background of existence</p>
<p t="115200" d="4580">the unknowable background of existence is
the thing that generates everything.</p>
<p t="119780" d="4860">paired with that of course according to the
schema that we&#39;ve been working with is the</p>
<p t="124640" d="5310">archetype of the great father. and the archetype
of the great father is the archetype of tradition</p>
<p t="129950" d="1060">fundamentally.</p>
<p t="131010" d="5760">The great weight of the past
because as you incorporate your past the past</p>
<p t="136770" d="5350">of your culture through the intermediation
of your parents you learn routines and rituals</p>
<p t="142120" d="4670">for structure in the unknown now those routines
and rituals are patterns of action that you</p>
<p t="146790" d="3160">use in the world as such.</p>
<p t="149950" d="5000">And also a complex patterns of action that
you use to structure your own interpretations</p>
<p t="154950" d="4080">and your own motor output and your own conceptualizations
when you&#39;re dealing with other people and</p>
<p t="159030" d="5860">so that would be the absorption the most fundamentally
of your cultural rules and the fact of those</p>
<p t="164890" d="7040">cultural rules and their incarnation in you
essentially keeps chaos at bay which means</p>
<p t="171930" d="4660">if two of you share the same cultural structure,
assuming you&#39;re playing the same game so to</p>
<p t="176590" d="4090">speak that means that you can each predict
each other's responses which is very, very</p>
<p t="180680" d="4800">useful because that way you can be sure that
you can trust the other person you can more</p>
<p t="185480" d="4250">or less infer their goals because after all
their value structure's similar to yours</p>
<p t="189730" d="4140">and if you can infer their goals that means
you can embody their emotions,</p>
<p t="193870" d="4089">So that's the benevolent aspect of tradition
right the part that protects and shelters</p>
<p t="197959" d="4971">you and structures the nature of your being
in the face of existential terror and doubt</p>
<p t="202930" d="6200">so to speak but there&#39;s also an aspect of
tradition that's terrible, tyrannical.</p>
<p t="209130" d="5150">it's the part that marches young men off
to war say in defense of the structures that</p>
<p t="214280" d="1000">it's protecting.</p>
<p t="215280" d="4959">It's the part that says when you&#39;re a teenager
wear this and not this or you&#39;ll be the target</p>
<p t="220239" d="1750">of mockery for all your peers.</p>
<p t="221989" d="5641">It's the part of the structure that crushes
the creative life out of you because the tyrannical</p>
<p t="227630" d="5050">aspect of social order doesn't want your
creative life so to speak what it wants is</p>
<p t="232680" d="6339">your obedience because your obedience is what
makes the machine run smooth and so you&#39;re</p>
<p t="239019" d="5721">always in an ambivalent relationship with
regards to security to authority on the one</p>
<p t="244740" d="4779">hand it provides you shelter and what you
need and allows you to gain the benefits of</p>
<p t="249519" d="3531">literally thousands and thousands of years
of cultural evolution.</p>
<p t="253050" d="4659">On the other hand it's the thing that makes
you obey or face the painful consequences</p>
<p t="257709" d="6731">thereof which can range from mere social exclusion
and consequent reexposure to the unknown to</p>
<p t="264440" d="8150">truly oppressive practices designed to make
you be exactly like everyone else or else.</p>
<p t="272590" d="6150">And so you could say most particularly again
that that's a standard existential problem</p>
<p t="278740" d="4669">it's a problem that's faced by people
in every place and in ever culture, balancing</p>
<p t="283409" d="7560">the appropriate attitude towards culture</p>
<p t="290969" d="5211">So the most fundamental representation of
culture can be portrayed essentially in this</p>
<p t="296180" d="2000">manner I think.</p>
<p t="298180" d="4880">And what you see here is the dragon of chaos
of course lurking in the background and what</p>
<p t="303060" d="5910">that means is that all forms come from the
formless and that the father itself is a primary</p>
<p t="308970" d="5520">form a representation of God the father and
God the father in the Christian trinity is</p>
<p t="314490" d="6860">the representation of the positive and the
security and the tyrannical aspect of social</p>
<p t="321350" d="4790">order right God has a set of rules for you,
you bloody well better listen to those rules</p>
<p t="326140" d="3620">if you don't all hell's gonna break loose
and you know that's a pretty reasonable</p>
<p t="329760" d="2500">summary of how things work unfortunately.</p>
<p t="332260" d="4820">so on the one hand God offers security on
the other hand he offers tyranny and in total</p>
<p t="337080" d="5920">that basically represents order so you can
see this representation is quite useful; shows</p>
<p t="343000" d="6969">God's standing over this city which of course
is a city committed to him fundamentally so</p>
<p t="349969" d="4291">it operates under the moral principals that
he represents and behind him is a representation</p>
<p t="354260" d="6770">of the sun which is partly a representation
of the source of all life partly a representation</p>
<p t="361030" d="3790">of the source of consciousness and illumination
right because you&#39;re conscious during the</p>
<p t="364820" d="6959">day and partly a halo representing a sort
of transcendent nature of the of the social</p>
<p t="371779" d="5991">order that structures existence so it's
a primary phenomenon and it's only to say</p>
<p t="377770" d="6170">that in all human experience there&#39;s a cultural
aspect and a natural aspect and a funny thing</p>
<p t="383940" d="4180">is the cultural aspect in some ways is as
natural as the natural aspect right because</p>
<p t="388120" d="5310">we're social beings we can't exist without
society, society's structures as our very</p>
<p t="393430" d="1500">nature.</p>
<p t="394930" d="7630">And we're beneficiaries and victims.</p>
<p t="402560" d="8109">And so then just as the case - just as is
the case with the feminine there&#39;s a two aspects</p>
<p t="410669" d="5000">that can be represented metaphorically with
regards to the masculine you can say well</p>
<p t="415669" d="5361">the secure aspect of social order is the wise
king and you can see it written in medieval</p>
<p t="421030" d="4220">representation of him here sitting on his
throne calmly in a relatively open posture</p>
<p t="425250" d="4839">that means he's ready to listen to supplicants
to people who are coming to talk to him.</p>
<p t="430089" d="3931">He's holding an orb with a cross on top
of it which means essentially that he's</p>
<p t="434020" d="3959">in control of the world and that the world
is subordinated to something else that's</p>
<p t="437979" d="1151">represented by the cross.</p>
<p t="439130" d="6550">A wise and just ruler and then his mirror
image here is the son devouring king a very</p>
<p t="445680" d="5930">common mythological theme the father who wants
to destroy his son and shades of the Oedipal</p>
<p t="451610" d="3950">conflict in that of course if you remember
your Freud but basically what it means is</p>
<p t="455560" d="8409">this is that despite the fact that every human
being is an offspring of culture by nature,</p>
<p t="463969" d="3870">every human being is also in the terrible
position of facing the fact that their very</p>
<p t="467839" d="4921">individuality is likely to be crushed out
of them during during the socialization process.</p>
<p t="472760" d="4680">And in a sense that's really not an that's
really not avoidable I mean if you&#39;re subject</p>
<p t="477440" d="5510">to really tyrannical socialization it's
obviously a much more cardinal problem right</p>
<p t="482950" d="4709">but even if you&#39;re subject to socialization
under normal circumstances you are still what</p>
<p t="487659" d="5491">you are rather than the many fold things that
you could&#39;ve otherwise been and just to give</p>
<p t="493150" d="5810">you some sense of how dramatic a process this
really is one of the things you should know</p>
<p t="498960" d="6530">is that you actually die into your brain so
one of the things you might wonder is why</p>
<p t="505490" d="4419">is it that death evolved it doesn't really
make up much sense from a Darwinian perspective,</p>
<p t="509909" d="3820">right because you&#39;d make the presupposition
that if you could just stick around and father</p>
<p t="513729" d="4631">children say for 250 years you&#39;d be doing
a lot better job than the poor sap who only</p>
<p t="518360" d="5730">lived to be 30 so why is it that you only
live to be 70 and really your period of fertility</p>
<p t="524090" d="2130">is over say by the time you&#39;re 40.</p>
<p t="526220" d="3360">Why would that be what&#39;s the utility of death?</p>
<p t="529580" d="4960">And then you remember well the environment's
always changing right in this chaotic manner</p>
<p t="534540" d="2710">that's represented by the great mother.</p>
<p t="537250" d="6220">Can you change with it and in answer to that
is yes but only to a certain point.</p>
<p t="543470" d="5160">Which is why as people age they tend to become
more and more alienated from the current culture</p>
<p t="548630" d="5649">right they've they've adopted their position
of being say which is a more or less fixed</p>
<p t="554279" d="4961">by the time they&#39;re 25 or so once their pre
frontal cortex matures and then after that</p>
<p t="559240" d="4190">the world gets away from them they don't
have enough biological resources left to constantly</p>
<p t="563430" d="5639">undergo new revolutionary neurological processes
and part of the reason is this.</p>
<p t="569069" d="6060">You have more neuro connections in your brain
when you&#39;re first born than you do for the</p>
<p t="575129" d="4520">rest of your life, any other time in your
life and as you learn when you&#39;re an infant</p>
<p t="579649" d="4471">and as you learn say over the first two years
what happens is that there&#39;s a plentitude</p>
<p t="584120" d="4870">of circuits and they die off leaving only
those circuits that have a function and you</p>
<p t="588990" d="2870">think about that it's kind of a quasi Darwinian
process.</p>
<p t="591860" d="4610">And so what that means is that as you mature
and become fixed in your form you know to</p>
<p t="596470" d="6489">adopt your personality whatever it becomes,
what&#39;s happening is that the excess possibility</p>
<p t="602959" d="4570">in some sense is being demolished by experience.</p>
<p t="607529" d="5141">So the tyrannical aspect of enculturation
is something that's real because it makes</p>
<p t="612670" d="2930">you in large part what you are.</p>
<p t="615600" d="6440">And you have to understand as well that that's
necessary because it's better to be something,</p>
<p t="622040" d="3729">in the final analysis it's better to be
something than to be nothing.</p>
<p t="625769" d="5940">But you know we still have residual dreams
like those expressed by Peter Pan say who&#39;s</p>
<p t="631709" d="4411">the boy that never wants to grow up because
he doesn't wanna attain any final and fixed</p>
<p t="636120" d="5290">form and it's interesting because in one
respect as you progress through your life</p>
<p t="641410" d="4799">you&#39;re climbing assuming things are going
well you&#39;re climbing to ever new heights but</p>
<p t="646209" d="5651">on the other hand the direction that you&#39;re
going in constantly narrows as you age so</p>
<p t="651860" d="4690">there&#39;s a real trade off there and I think
the existential angst that's caused as a</p>
<p t="656550" d="3139">consequence of that trade off is often real.</p>
<p t="659689" d="4172">And I also think that adolescents and early
adults feel this most intently which is part</p>
<p t="663861" d="5179">of the reason why they tend to rebel against
social structures in general you know whether</p>
<p t="669040" d="4310">it's the military industrial complex or
the corporate world or globalization or what</p>
<p t="673350" d="5570">have you is that you have these large structures
that represent the tyrannical aspect of social</p>
<p t="678920" d="6870">being and it's no wonder that the fact of
those structures engenders rebellion, it should.</p>
<p t="685790" d="3370">On the other hand it's also no wonder that
structures like that exist because if they</p>
<p t="689160" d="5890">didn&#39;t exist then people would have no way
of interrelating their social being and we</p>
<p t="695050" d="4420">would revert back to the sort of Hobbsian
state of war where everybody's arms are</p>
<p t="699470" d="2320">around everybody else's throat.</p>
<p t="701790" d="2859">That doesn't mean the payoff is always good.</p>
<p t="704649" d="5841">So… the Freudians of course had a real field
day with this, and we're most fundamentally</p>
<p t="710490" d="2099">concerned by it.</p>
<p t="712589" d="4120">part of the reason that Freudian psychology
has had such an immense impact on western</p>
<p t="716709" d="5201">and world culture is because Freud came along
just when classical Judeo-Christian mythological</p>
<p t="721910" d="5130">structures were on the on a serious decline
in the west and Freud stepped in with a secularized</p>
<p t="727040" d="6979">mythological version of reality which said
well there&#39;s nature and that's the Id right</p>
<p t="734019" d="4800">that's the wild and untamed impulses that
spring up from the animal mind and there&#39;s</p>
<p t="738819" d="6531">the ego which is the individual whose in many
ways a pawn of these id like forces and then</p>
<p t="745350" d="6510">on top of the ego crushing it down into the
id so to speak is the superego which is the</p>
<p t="751860" d="5370">internal and external embodiment of social
order and morality so you can see the mythological</p>
<p t="757230" d="2039">substructure underlying Freud.</p>
<p t="759269" d="4541">Freud said well ego is always being shaped
by the superego and always compulsion it's</p>
<p t="763810" d="1000">“don't, don't”.</p>
<p t="764810" d="5959">It's always “no” it's like Old Testament
morality and the incarnation of the ten commandments.</p>
<p t="770769" d="3641">Whatever you wanna do if it feels good the
probability is high that it's immoral from</p>
<p t="774410" d="1560">the perspective of the social world</p>
<p t="775970" d="4320">and you can really see this with children
you know it's really remarkable to watch</p>
<p t="780290" d="5140">them because my sense is and I don't think
this is just because I&#39;m a particularly tyrannical</p>
<p t="785430" d="5110">father is that children often get in more
trouble for having fun than they do for any</p>
<p t="790540" d="5609">other reason because their capacity for unbridled
enjoyment is so unbridled that it actually</p>
<p t="796149" d="4880">poses a threat to orderly structure so you
know if a child really gets in an active mood</p>
<p t="801029" d="4891">and is playing a very active game I mean especially
if they&#39;re somewhere between say 3 and 5 they</p>
<p t="805920" d="4050">can tear your house to shreds and no time
no time flat and you&#39;re always bawling them</p>
<p t="809970" d="3349">out like no, no, no quiet down don't do
that.</p>
<p t="813319" d="3321">And you know they&#39;re smiling away and they&#39;re
happier than any adult you&#39;re ever gonna see</p>
<p t="816640" d="4049">in your entire life and you're doing everything
you can to push them down so that they&#39;re</p>
<p t="820689" d="3871">they can sit quietly and read a book or whatever
it is you think they should be doing and that's</p>
<p t="824560" d="4339">really nasty and horrible but by the same
token it's absolutely necessary because</p>
<p t="828899" d="4380">if they don't learn to bring their impulses
even their impulses their ludic impulses right</p>
<p t="833279" d="4680">their impulses to play under control then
nobody else can stand them and if they don't</p>
<p t="837959" d="4761">get access to the resources there in the social
world man they have one dismal life laid out</p>
<p t="842720" d="5190">in front of them so anyways so that's an
early description of the genesis of the conflict</p>
<p t="847910" d="3529">say between the ego and the superego and I
just wanted to point that out because it's</p>
<p t="851439" d="5411">not just sex and aggression that gets regulated
right we can understand why that might happen</p>
<p t="856850" d="3750">but it's also playfulness and creativity
and spontaneity and all the things that we</p>
<p t="860600" d="5510">associated with the joy of being that the
terrible tyrannical social structure puts</p>
<p t="866110" d="1500">a clamp on.</p>
<p t="867610" d="5539">So Jaak Panksepp for example has recently
demonstrated that children, boys because it's</p>
<p t="873149" d="5560">usually boys who have attention deficit disorder
which is generally diagnosed in the school</p>
<p t="878709" d="5690">room do much better if they&#39;re placed on methylphenidate
which is a kind of amphetamine fundamentally</p>
<p t="884399" d="4670">but normal kids do better on amphetamines
too by the way they can focus better they</p>
<p t="889069" d="4671">can focus more and they can pay attention
more mostly what methylphenidate does is suppress</p>
<p t="893740" d="5940">play so Panksepp notes is that well what's
happening with these ADHD kids hyperactive</p>
<p t="899680" d="6839">kids is they&#39;re more playful more boisterously
playful which is tends to be a masculine attribute</p>
<p t="906519" d="5040">in juvenile forms of many mammals they&#39;re
boisterously playful give them a little methylphenidate</p>
<p t="911559" d="4791">that shuts down their play behaviour and they
can sit down and focus you know and well you</p>
<p t="916350" d="4279">can understand how even if you might think
that's necessary because apparently many</p>
<p t="920629" d="4851">people do you can also still understand that
by the same token that probably represents</p>
<p t="925480" d="6279">some kind of loss because we like to see kids
play and it's good for them besides, so</p>
<p t="931759" d="4510">anyways Freud says the ego pops up it's
all thrilled to death with the world a superego</p>
<p t="936269" d="4310">comes along and shuts it down and that's
a fate that befalls all of us and not only</p>
<p t="940579" d="4161">that because Freud's a pretty wise man all
things considered he doesn't say that's</p>
<p t="944740" d="9250">all to the bad he says that's the price
we pay for social being and fair enough.</p>
<p t="953990" d="4430">you see this happening in children all the
time where part of what they do as they mature</p>
<p t="958420" d="4280">is to adopt roles so they'll play being
a father or being a mother say and what they&#39;re</p>
<p t="962700" d="6499">doing is pulling in what they see as a as
the world view that characterizes parenthood</p>
<p t="969199" d="4591">embodying the father playing out the role
and trying to organize their motivational</p>
<p t="973790" d="5169">structures within observed framework say that
the father provides and that's an introjections</p>
<p t="978959" d="5901">of social wisdom if you can imagine that the
role of father say has a structure like one</p>
<p t="984860" d="5490">structure would be well if you're a father
and you&#39;re around to model then you have to</p>
<p t="990350" d="3649">be taking care of the children or at least
you have to be there often enough so that</p>
<p t="993999" d="5231">you can be a target of modeling and so you
can imagine that the spirit of the father</p>
<p t="999230" d="5479">that's modeled at least in the optimal circumstances
is one that deals out rules and order but</p>
<p t="1004709" d="5740">that also provides nurturing care and support
and that's a kind of story we know fathers</p>
<p t="1010449" d="4521">who aren&#39;t like that and maybe we know fathers
who are too much like that but all things</p>
<p t="1014970" d="6029">considered on the average you have a father
role and children attempt to interject that</p>
<p t="1020999" d="3511">and that's part of the way that they learn
to modulate their own motivational resources</p>
<p t="1024510" d="6299">so for example if the child observes the father
and the mother sharing which means taking</p>
<p t="1030809" d="5380">each others motivational states into account
then they can act out the game of sharing</p>
<p t="1036189" d="5010">with a doll say representing a child and what
they&#39;re doing is trying to imagine what it's</p>
<p t="1041199" d="5441">like inside that doll's head treating it
like a person, by embodying the potential</p>
<p t="1046640" d="4890">motivations and emotions states of that pretend
object in their own body, and then by trying</p>
<p t="1051530" d="5190">to organize a high order structure which would
be like the tea party where tea is shared</p>
<p t="1056720" d="4010">a higher order structure where you have a
turn because you want a turn because you&#39;re</p>
<p t="1060730" d="4319">thirsty like me and then I have a turn and
we both get what we want and we can exchange</p>
<p t="1065049" d="1000">information</p>
<p t="1066049" d="4990">and well that's a little bit more optimistic
representation of the tyranny of social order</p>
<p t="1071039" d="5101">that pure compulsion right because what it
suggests is there&#39;s a way that you can organize</p>
<p t="1076140" d="7009">the way you are genuinely and the way I am
genuinely so that we both are genuine yet</p>
<p t="1083149" d="5121">we get something more than we would get if
we would just fire ourselves and so you think</p>
<p t="1088270" d="4649">that with kids they like to play by themselves
but by the time they&#39;re about 3 and a half</p>
<p t="1092919" d="5671">or four boy they have a hunger for other children
and they'll do anything in order to go out</p>
<p t="1098590" d="5120">and play with other kids so you can say that
well if you take all the toys off your bed</p>
<p t="1103710" d="2950">I'll go let you play with your friend and
like the toys are off there in two tenths</p>
<p t="1106660" d="4100">of a second and they&#39;re out the door because
they have this primary need to go out and</p>
<p t="1110760" d="4230">experiment with the social world and in large
way in large part that's how they build</p>
<p t="1114990" d="6169">the complex higher order more abstract structures
that enable them to regulate their motive</p>
<p t="1121159" d="4561">their motivational states and their emotional
state without just “no”.</p>
<p t="1125720" d="5170">It's a more sophisticated way of doing it
right it's better to play a game with someone</p>
<p t="1130890" d="2850">than to engage in a battle of wills with them.</p>
<p t="1133740" d="4860">Because then there&#39;s no compulsion there&#39;s
just mutual participation and that's critical</p>
<p t="1138600" d="5559">because one of the things that the notion
of the tyranny of the social order brings</p>
<p t="1144159" d="4770">up as a question is all right all right so
you have to take part in society.</p>
<p t="1148929" d="5000">You have to take your part in the social world,
yet the social world wants its pound of flesh</p>
<p t="1153929" d="4831">or its 60 pounds of flesh depending on where
you live.</p>
<p t="1158760" d="4370">On the one so you&#39;re damned if you do so to
speak and you&#39;re damned if you don't what</p>
<p t="1163130" d="5230">do you do as a consequence of facing that
challenge and so you remember with the great</p>
<p t="1168360" d="5480">mother with chaos and the unknown the way
you meet the challenge is to understand that</p>
<p t="1173840" d="3830">the things you don't understand are dangerous
and frightening and that if you encounter</p>
<p t="1177670" d="5570">them they can hurt you and that this is real
but you don't run away all the same if you&#39;re</p>
<p t="1183240" d="3919">trying to get somewhere the things you don't
understand happen you can't shut yourself</p>
<p t="1187159" d="6611">down you have to explore cautiously and try
to gain new knowledge.</p>
<p t="1193770" d="6960">Well how do you organize your social being
well let's make the presupposition that</p>
<p t="1200730" d="7690">you got half a dozen or so fundamental motivational
states right so what they are is your subjugation</p>
<p t="1208420" d="3730">to a world of apriory deities.</p>
<p t="1212150" d="9420">You see in children rage fear, hunger anger
affiliation, love, the capacity of play all</p>
<p t="1221570" d="2030">value sets.</p>
<p t="1223600" d="5569">Which have their own goal like behavioral
patterns their own world view their own way</p>
<p t="1229169" d="6541">of manifesting themselves all those are innate
they&#39;re all dependent on pre wired neural</p>
<p t="1235710" d="1450">architectural systems.</p>
<p t="1237160" d="2509">They have to unfold in experience but they&#39;re
there.</p>
<p t="1239669" d="3201">Okay and so let's say that's what you
come into the world with and that's what</p>
<p t="1242870" d="6030">you come into the world with but then the
fact that you&#39;re in the world poses a more</p>
<p t="1248900" d="5160">complex problem which is well yeah you've
got one motivational state happening you&#39;re</p>
<p t="1254060" d="1270">angry.</p>
<p t="1255330" d="3199">But then you've got another you have to
worry about which is you&#39;d like to be affiliated</p>
<p t="1258529" d="1101">with someone.</p>
<p t="1259630" d="4210">Like your sibling so you got a real conflict
with your sibling it's like you really hate</p>
<p t="1263840" d="3870">them but you really like them too and you
wanna play with them so what do you do about</p>
<p t="1267710" d="1000">that?</p>
<p t="1268710" d="6020">Well you&#39;d say a behaviourally disregulated
child who isn&#39;t well socialized they&#39;re impulsive.</p>
<p t="1274730" d="5090">They don't they don't act as if they take
the future into account so they heavy future</p>
<p t="1279820" d="2109">discount their impulses what does that mean.</p>
<p t="1281929" d="5061">if you watch a child have a temper tantrum
which around two they&#39;re really prone to it's</p>
<p t="1286990" d="4120">like it's a phenomena it's like a tornado
on a real small scale.</p>
<p t="1291110" d="6090">Child's just flipped out if you saw an adult
do that you&#39;d run away screaming right.</p>
<p t="1297200" d="4580">And, they&#39;re completely dominated by this
emotional state.</p>
<p t="1301780" d="4560">And my sense watching that has always been
to try to help the kid not have that happen</p>
<p t="1306340" d="4270">to them because it looks like a terrible catastrophe
for their emerging ego right I mean they&#39;re</p>
<p t="1310610" d="4780">trying to get their world together and something
frustrates them and (WHOOMP!) up come these</p>
<p t="1315390" d="5000">amygdalic projections that govern the anger
hypothalamic even more primitive and just</p>
<p t="1320390" d="4340">like blow them over and then they&#39;re on the
floor and they&#39;re holding their breath and</p>
<p t="1324730" d="3130">they&#39;re turning blue and they&#39;re having a
fit and then it takes them like 15 minutes</p>
<p t="1327860" d="1500">to recover.</p>
<p t="1329360" d="5220">So they have to take themselves into account
as total as complete beings and that's the</p>
<p t="1334580" d="4110">emergence of a higher order morality but it's
more complicated than that because not only</p>
<p t="1338690" d="3459">do they have the problem of themselves which
is a bad enough problem but then they have</p>
<p t="1342149" d="2761">the problem of the other person.</p>
<p t="1344910" d="6399">So what's the proper response of the individual,
given that he or she is threatened by the</p>
<p t="1351309" d="4031">natural world and the unknown on the left
hand, and threatened by the social order and</p>
<p t="1355340" d="6589">its tyranny on the right hand, but also dependent
on the natural world and chaos for all good</p>
<p t="1361929" d="4391">things and all new information, and dependent
on the social order for their very mode of</p>
<p t="1366320" d="4890">being, right, caught between four paradoxes
all at the same time.</p>
<p t="1371210" d="2780">How can that route be properly negotiated?</p>
<p t="1373990" d="8870">Well, and then you can look at hero mythology,
and the most common plot, and I would say</p>
<p t="1382860" d="5370">in some ways the only plot, although there
are variations of this that are endless, romantic</p>
<p t="1388230" d="6590">variations or adventure story variations,
or variations of failed heroic endeavor.</p>
<p t="1394820" d="5720">Still the only plot goes something like this:
there's a current state of being, now that</p>
<p t="1400540" d="5200">can be represented by a psychological state,
your current personality, it can be represented</p>
<p t="1405740" d="6200">by your family, it can be represented by your
extended social group, your city, your town,</p>
<p t="1411940" d="6359">your country, your ecosystem, your, your,
your, in science fiction frequently the entire</p>
<p t="1418299" d="5621">global community, right, a structure is threatened;
by what?</p>
<p t="1423920" d="1910">Well, you name it.</p>
<p t="1425830" d="3079">If it's dangerous, it can threaten the structure.</p>
<p t="1428909" d="3661">That can be one of various forms of barbarian,
right?</p>
<p t="1432570" d="5290">Any person from another culture, an alien
in science fiction, a terrible monster that</p>
<p t="1437860" d="4280">lives in the deep that had been dominated
and oppressed before but has come back for</p>
<p t="1442140" d="5430">more, an agent of horror, that's a common
theme in modern horror movies, right?</p>
<p t="1447570" d="6210">An object that moves, the ghosts in the basement
because the dead were improperly buried, etc.,</p>
<p t="1453780" d="8889">etc., etc., anything uncanny, anything fear-inspiring,
anything reptilian, anything that smothers</p>
<p t="1462669" d="8931">or entrances, or seduces, or you name it;
if it's change or some metaphoric representation</p>
<p t="1471600" d="5301">of anything that can change, then it's this,
the dragon of chaos, and that's the thing</p>
<p t="1476901" d="6929">that always threatens the stable state in
its multiple potential manifest forms, and</p>
<p t="1483830" d="1000">what does that mean?</p>
<p t="1484830" d="5770">It means the apocalypse is always happening,
right? the end of the world is always before</p>
<p t="1490600" d="4789">us, which is why you see apocalyptic images,
for example, throughout the new testament</p>
<p t="1495389" d="3811">Christ says: “The world is coming to an
end”, and people are waiting around for</p>
<p t="1499200" d="4740">it to happen, but what they don't precisely
understand is that the world is always coming</p>
<p t="1503940" d="5860">to an end, always, and that's because what
you think now is not good enough for the next</p>
<p t="1509800" d="4710">second, right, you have to change because
change is coming, and what change means is</p>
<p t="1514510" d="5620">you have to let go of what you know; that's
the apocalypse, and it's always on us.</p>
<p t="1520130" d="2230">The structure is threatened.</p>
<p t="1522360" d="2640">Well what do you do about that?</p>
<p t="1525000" d="6510">Well, you can run, but you can't hide, right,
that's the theory, and the reason for that</p>
<p t="1531510" d="6291">is that even if you are unwilling to face
the threat that's right in front of you,</p>
<p t="1537801" d="3709">no matter where you run to that threat's
going to be there, and so you see in the case</p>
<p t="1541510" d="4350">of a aggrophobic woman who starts to run away
from the shopping mall when she has heart</p>
<p t="1545860" d="4429">palpitations that then she runs away from
the subway, and then she runs away from taxis,</p>
<p t="1550289" d="3221">and then buses, and then other people, and,
and then finally she's at home and there's</p>
<p t="1553510" d="4340">nowhere to run but her heart's been palpitating,
and the fear of death is still on her, and</p>
<p t="1557850" d="4319">there's no place to go, so hiding isn't
much of a help.</p>
<p t="1562169" d="4161">or you can pretend that the chaotic thing
isn't there and refuse to change, but all</p>
<p t="1566330" d="4890">that does is make the threat bigger and bigger
and bigger and bigger, so just like, simply</p>
<p t="1571220" d="4600">put, well say you only have a hundred dollars
in the bank and you have a hundred and ten</p>
<p t="1575820" d="3849">dollar telephone bill, and you think, well
I, huh, I'd like that hundred dollars, I'm</p>
<p t="1579669" d="3970">not gonna pay that telephone bill; it's
just a little threat, right, but then you</p>
<p t="1583639" d="3371">don't pay it, and the next month it's
a hundred and twenty-five dollar telephone</p>
<p t="1587010" d="3610">bill, and then they slap a fifty dollar charge
on you, and then they cut off your phone,</p>
<p t="1590620" d="3820">so then you don't have a phone, then you
miss a job appointment, and that's not so</p>
<p t="1594440" d="3599">good, and then it's two hundred and fifty
dollars to pay your phone bill and another</p>
<p t="1598039" d="3890">two hundred to get it hooked back up, and
then your credit record goes all to hell because</p>
<p t="1601929" d="4031">you haven't paid any of that, and then you
can't buy a house when you're 25, and</p>
<p t="1605960" d="5390">you think, kind of weird, eh, little bitty
chaos turns into a great big monster, and</p>
<p t="1611350" d="5351">partly that's because everything that looks
separate from everything else isn't, it</p>
<p t="1616701" d="6358">just looks that way, and when you ignore anything,
especially if it's impeding your progress,</p>
<p t="1623059" d="4211">you know it's impeding your progress, you
know you have to deal with it, step away from</p>
<p t="1627270" d="5110">it and see what its true nature really is,
so you can hide, and you can not change, or</p>
<p t="1632380" d="5200">you can pretend that the threat doesn't
exist, but in the final analysis that just</p>
<p t="1637580" d="33870">stores up the catastrophe for later.</p>
