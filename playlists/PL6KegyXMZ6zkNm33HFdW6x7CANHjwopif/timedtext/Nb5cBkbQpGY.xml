<p t="12240" d="2510">So one of the propositions that I?</p>
<p t="16500" d="2840">Set forth for you last week was that</p>
<p t="20580" d="2059">the most real Things are</p>
<p t="23279" d="4040">the things that are most permanent across time and and that</p>
<p t="27869" d="7610">Manifests themselves in the largest number of situations and those are the things that you have to map successfully in order to survive</p>
<p t="36420" d="4610">survive of individuals that survive as a species over a very long period Of time and so</p>
<p t="41550" d="2510">the question is one question is</p>
<p t="44580" d="2000">what are the</p>
<p t="46650" d="4129">constants of experience if you are a</p>
<p t="51450" d="2000">follower of the Evolutionary</p>
<p t="54600" d="3950">Psychologists and to some degree the evolutionary biologist, but I would say more the psychologists</p>
<p t="61140" d="2000">like to be in close Metis</p>
<p t="64769" d="2360">They have a very afro centric</p>
<p t="68460" d="3619">view of Human evolution and the idea basically is that</p>
<p t="74280" d="6500">After we diverged from the common ancestor between Chimpanzees Bonobos and human beings</p>
<p t="82170" d="3860">We spent a tremendous amount of time in the african environment</p>
<p t="86700" d="3800">Mostly on the veldt although. We&#39;re not absolutely certain about that</p>
<p t="91049" d="5600">We&#39;re also very good in water human beings and we have some of the features of aquatic mammals</p>
<p t="97290" d="1439">so</p>
<p t="98729" d="2000">while hairlessness being one of them</p>
<p t="101520" d="1760">Women have a subcutaneously</p>
<p t="103280" d="6449">They are fat or feeder quite nicely adapted for swimming and so buckminster fuller who I wouldn&#39;t call a mainstream</p>
<p t="110159" d="1801">evolutionary psychologist</p>
<p t="111960" d="6620">Hypothesized back in the 70s that we spent some period of time in our evolutionary history living on beaches near the ocean</p>
<p t="119010" d="2000">That idea really</p>
<p t="121560" d="6020">Echoes for me because we like beaches a lot, and it&#39;s a great place if you want to get easy food</p>
<p t="127580" d="4079">And we&#39;re pretty damn good at swimming for for Terrestrial mammals</p>
<p t="131659" d="931">And we are hairless</p>
<p t="132590" d="5160">And we do cry salt tears and there&#39;s a lot of evidence that we and our feet if you think about our feet</p>
<p t="137750" d="5219">They&#39;re quite flipper like I know we are stand up and all that and walk, so that&#39;s part of the adaptation</p>
<p t="142969" d="1961">But we&#39;re pretty good at swimming</p>
<p t="144930" d="1230">so</p>
<p t="146160" d="1380">anyways</p>
<p t="147540" d="4610">The classical evolutionary psychology view is that we spent most of our time on the African veldt?</p>
<p t="152640" d="3169">It in the critical period of our evolutionary development</p>
<p t="155810" d="6300">let&#39;s say after we diverged from this common ancestor, and that were adapted for that environment and one of the</p>
<p t="163050" d="6470">consequences of that is the idea that we&#39;re that things have changed so much around us that we&#39;re really not adapted to the</p>
<p t="170160" d="5179">environment that we&#39;re in anymore, and I really believe that because I think that the idea that the</p>
<p t="176069" d="2000">primary Forces that shaped our evolution</p>
<p t="178950" d="2000">shaped them during that period of time</p>
<p t="181800" d="1469">call it A</p>
<p t="183269" d="4010">Roughly a seven million period Year period of time something like that and</p>
<p t="188700" d="7250">That that was somehow a special time for human evolution that set our nature. I don&#39;t believe that</p>
<p t="197940" d="2299">I mean, it&#39;s true to some degree, but</p>
<p t="201360" d="5149">it&#39;s more useful to view the evolution of human cognitive processes over the entire span of</p>
<p t="206820" d="3709">Evolutionary history and not necessarily give preference to any particular</p>
<p t="211170" d="6409">Epoch and I certainly believe that the idea that we&#39;re no longer adapted to the environment because of our rapid technological</p>
<p t="218160" d="5449">Transformations is simply not true and the reason. I think that it&#39;s not true is because the fundamental constants of the</p>
<p t="224700" d="6229">Environment let&#39;s say or it&#39;s more of the fundamental constants constituent elements of being I think that&#39;s the right way to think about it</p>
<p t="230930" d="2520">They&#39;re the same they haven&#39;t changed a bit</p>
<p t="233450" d="5669">and there is no way of changing them as far as I can tell without us being radically and</p>
<p t="240299" d="6529">Incomprehensibly different than we are and you know with with the rapid rise of artificial intelligence and robotics and all of that</p>
<p t="246989" d="3170">It&#39;s certainly possible then in five hundred years will be completely</p>
<p t="251310" d="4309">Will be so like unlike the way we are now that we won&#39;t even be the same creatures</p>
<p t="255620" d="5339">I don&#39;t think that&#39;s a particularly great outcome, but it&#39;s certainly possible. So what are the fundamental?</p>
<p t="262109" d="1891">constituent Elements</p>
<p t="264000" d="5720">Well, they&#39;re expressed in mythology, but they&#39;re not merely symbolic. I think it&#39;s the wrong way to think about it</p>
<p t="269970" d="6170">They&#39;re symbolic, but they reflect a very deep reality and they actually reflect a reality that&#39;s not easily apprehensible</p>
<p t="276900" d="5360">Directly by the senses now your senses are tuned for a particular duration</p>
<p t="283140" d="2000">That&#39;s roughly excuse me</p>
<p t="288270" d="3259">That&#39;s roughly the duration that you live let&#39;s say</p>
<p t="291530" d="6029">But more importantly it&#39;s the duration whatever that duration is across which meaningful actions take place</p>
<p t="297560" d="3660">And we kind of have some idea of what that duration is. You know if you look at a</p>
<p t="301770" d="1350">computer screen if</p>
<p t="303120" d="1050">it has a</p>
<p t="304170" d="6470">Refresh rate of less than 60 Hertz you can see it&#39;s liquor abut above 60 Hertz you can&#39;t its uniform and with movies</p>
<p t="312090" d="4640">Anywhere between 20 and 50 frames a second is enough to give you the illusion of continual motion</p>
<p t="317100" d="2959">so you know we live in a universe that&#39;s</p>
<p t="320400" d="5029">Above the tenth of a second domain or maybe the hundredth of a second somewhere in there anyways</p>
<p t="325430" d="3300">And I mean it&#39;s not like time isn&#39;t almost infinitely subdivide</p>
<p t="329310" d="3529">At higher levels of resolution than that, but we don&#39;t operate</p>
<p t="333450" d="2510">generally speaking at higher temporary</p>
<p t="344670" d="5630">A something approximating 1/2 a second to a second you know I mean, it&#39;s an estimate obviously</p>
<p t="350300" d="520">but a</p>
<p t="350820" d="690">second is a</p>
<p t="351510" d="5869">meaningful unit of time for a person and a hundredth of a second really isn&#39;t and certainly a billionth of a second isn&#39;t and then</p>
<p t="357600" d="3769">You know we can think across hours and days and weeks and months</p>
<p t="361440" d="5839">But we really can&#39;t once you start getting out in two years it gets kind of sketchy and it&#39;s hard to think more than five</p>
<p t="367280" d="6360">Years down the road and the reason for that is that the particulars upon which you&#39;re basing your predictions are likely to change</p>
<p t="374100" d="6889">Sufficiently over a five year period So that extending out your vision past that just exposes you to accelerating error</p>
<p t="381360" d="4729">Right and that and of course that&#39;s the problem with predicting the future period So we live in a time range</p>
<p t="386090" d="4860">That&#39;s about say a tenth of a second to three three years something like that now</p>
<p t="390950" d="1500">I know it can expand Beyond up</p>
<p t="392450" d="6239">But that&#39;s that&#39;s kind of where we&#39;re set and our senses seem to be tuned to those durations and and to be</p>
<p t="398910" d="2000">Operative so that we make proper</p>
<p t="401070" d="6709">Decisions within those durations and and also from from a particular spatial position and so forth you know</p>
<p t="408090" d="2179">Your eyes see what&#39;s roughly</p>
<p t="412159" d="4279">Maybe we could say a walkable distance in front of you something like that, so</p>
<p t="417019" d="5720">Then you get detect things and in the locale that enables you to immediately interact with things</p>
<p t="423079" d="4309">But it isn&#39;t necessarily the case that senses that are tuned to do that are</p>
<p t="427639" d="8000">Also tuned to inform you directly about what the most permanent things about being itself are I think that those things have to be?</p>
<p t="435829" d="4490">Inferred and there&#39;s some there&#39;s some supporting evidence for that kind of thing from</p>
<p t="441379" d="2000">from pSycholinguistics</p>
<p t="444349" d="1830">there&#39;s a level of</p>
<p t="446179" d="2000">categorization that we seem to</p>
<p t="448639" d="5780">Manifest more or less automatically or implicitly so for example when children perceive?</p>
<p t="455149" d="3589">Animals they they perceive at the level of cat or dog</p>
<p t="459739" d="5120">They don&#39;t they don&#39;t perceive at the level of subspecies like siamese cat or or?</p>
<p t="465379" d="5149">Or or let&#39;s say samoyed you know there&#39;s this. There&#39;s a natural</p>
<p t="470529" d="3119">I can&#39;t remember what they call that base category something like that</p>
<p t="473649" d="3809">it&#39;s usually specified by very short words that are easily learn about and so the</p>
<p t="477529" d="3679">Linguistic system seems to map right on to the to the object recognition</p>
<p t="483409" d="5059">Characteristics of the Sensory systems that are built right into it and and if they weren&#39;t built into it</p>
<p t="488469" d="5549">We couldn&#39;t communicate easily because our natural categories. I think that&#39;s it, but it&#39;s probably wrong our natural categories</p>
<p t="494209" d="5150">They have to be the same for every one or it would be very difficult for us to communicate, okay?</p>
<p t="499360" d="2669">So having said all that then the question is</p>
<p t="502669" d="2000">Well, what are the most?</p>
<p t="505309" d="2029">What are the most real categories?</p>
<p t="507339" d="6869">and I think there&#39;s there&#39;s a real division in ways to think about this because there&#39;s a scientific way of thinking about it and</p>
<p t="514550" d="4399">And in in that case the most real categories are well</p>
<p t="519349" d="5390">mathematical equations certainly seem to be and in the top category there that equations that describe the</p>
<p t="525259" d="2600">physical universe, but then then the</p>
<p t="528470" d="1169">hypothesis of</p>
<p t="529639" d="2989">the existence of such things as protons and and</p>
<p t="533209" d="7580">electrons, and you know that the material elements that make up everything that&#39;s every element of being the</p>
<p t="540800" d="2000">possible exception of empty space</p>
<p t="544820" d="6440">But in the in the mythological world the categories, I think are more derived from Darwinian</p>
<p t="552200" d="4250">by the effect of Darwinian processes on cognitive and perceptual function</p>
<p t="556850" d="5869">So which is to say that we have learned to perceive and then to infer those things that are most necessary?</p>
<p t="562820" d="2450">For us in order to continue our existence</p>
<p t="565490" d="5179">Propagate live well all of those things and that would be true at the level of individual survival</p>
<p t="570670" d="2369">And maybe it&#39;s also true at the level of Growth survival although</p>
<p t="573260" d="6950">You know the there&#39;s a tremendous debate among evolutionary biologists about whether or not selection can take place at the level of the group</p>
<p t="582050" d="7579">Anyways there are these basic level categories that manifest themselves to you and then there&#39;s categories of the imagination that you have to infer up</p>
<p t="589880" d="3530">from the sensory domain and we do that partly in Science by</p>
<p t="594710" d="2900">Comparing our sensory representations across people</p>
<p t="597610" d="3869">But we also do it by thinking abstractly conceptualizing abstractly</p>
<p t="601480" d="2940">And you know one of the things that&#39;s interesting about</p>
<p t="604700" d="6890">Abstractions is it&#39;s not clear whether they&#39;re more or less real than the things they&#39;re abstracted from you know that this is a perennial debate</p>
<p t="611900" d="2450">among let&#39;s call them ontology who are</p>
<p t="614960" d="6890">interested in that fundamental fundamental nature of reality itself in some sense independent of Conceptual structures are</p>
<p t="622040" d="5899">numbers more or less real than the things they represent it&#39;s a really hard question to answer because</p>
<p t="629090" d="5179">Knowing like using numbers as a representational system gives you unbelievable power</p>
<p t="634270" d="4320">And there are mathematicians that believe that there isn&#39;t anything more real than mathematical</p>
<p t="638900" d="6500">Representations now it depends to some degree of course on how you classify reality. That&#39;s the problem with the question like is a</p>
<p t="646850" d="5630">Equivalent to be the answer that always is well it depends on how you define a and it depends on how you define b</p>
<p t="652480" d="6539">So generally it&#39;s not a very useful question, but you can still get the point that there&#39;s something very real about abstraction</p>
<p t="660230" d="4219">Incredibly real because otherwise why would you bother with them they wouldn&#39;t give you any handle on the world?</p>
<p t="664700" d="3710">So what&#39;s the what&#39;s the most useful or what&#39;s the most?</p>
<p t="668720" d="4639">What&#39;s the broadest possible level of abstraction and is there any use of?</p>
<p t="673760" d="3140">any utility in thinking in that manner and I tried to</p>
<p t="677500" d="2940">make the case last time that that in the</p>
<p t="680660" d="5360">Mythological world there are three categories or four depending on what you do with the strange fourth Category?</p>
<p t="686210" d="3739">There&#39;s a fourth category sort of the category of on categories able</p>
<p t="690740" d="1320">entities and</p>
<p t="692060" d="5479">So it&#39;s sort of the category of everything that not only do you not know but you don&#39;t know you don&#39;t know it&#39;s it&#39;s or</p>
<p t="697670" d="5030">You can think about it as the category of potential. I actually think that&#39;s the best way to think about it</p>
<p t="702700" d="4859">Is that it&#39;s the dragon of Chaos is the category of potential, and I do believe that</p>
<p t="708380" d="2929">Where our materialist view is essentially wrong?</p>
<p t="711310" d="3809">I think that the proper way of looking at the at being is that being is?</p>
<p t="715610" d="7100">Potential and from that potential whatever consciousness is extracts out the reality that we inhabit anyways</p>
<p t="722710" d="2279">that&#39;s certainly the mythological Viewpoint and and</p>
<p t="725510" d="3500">But it&#39;s not just a mythological Viewpoint. It&#39;s a it&#39;s a</p>
<p t="729380" d="5750">sequence of ideas for example that deeply underlies the thinking of young piaget and piaget by the way</p>
<p t="735130" d="2309">it was very interested in reconciling the gap between</p>
<p t="737780" d="3139">religion and science that&#39;s really what he devoted his life to doing and</p>
<p t="741050" d="5299">So and there are other streams of philosophy and I would say heidegger the phenomenologist are are</p>
<p t="747050" d="5780">Thinking along lines that are similar to this as well because heidegger was concerned not with the nature of material reality</p>
<p t="752830" d="2940">but with being as such and and and</p>
<p t="756350" d="1290">so</p>
<p t="757640" d="6019">You can extract out the viewpoint that I just described from from Mythology, but it isn&#39;t the only source of such</p>
<p t="764810" d="1650">What would you call it?</p>
<p t="766460" d="2000">Hi</p>
<p t="770000" d="4130">hypotheses is probably the right idea so the idea you can think about this as a</p>
<p t="774260" d="5989">bootstrapping process in some senses in order for anything to get going it has to bootstrap itself up and</p>
<p t="780470" d="2990">Become more and more complex as it does that so it&#39;s it&#39;s like</p>
<p t="783460" d="2000">This is the answer to the chicken and egg problem</p>
<p t="785720" d="2960">Right which was first the chicken or the egg well neither</p>
<p t="789020" d="3829">Something from which both the chicken and egg were derived right because the the ultimate</p>
<p t="793010" d="3799">The ultimate answer to that is the answer to how there are things at all who knows</p>
<p t="796910" d="6920">but at some point there were neither chickens nor eggs, but there were the things that were the precursors to those things and so they</p>
<p t="805040" d="3860">spiraled upwards in some sense and those in the initial</p>
<p t="809660" d="1549">proto anta tease</p>
<p t="811209" d="1870">single celled animals for I</p>
<p t="813079" d="6020">Mean you can go back farther than that, but we could say well, single-cell animal is differentiated over time right, and there&#39;s this</p>
<p t="819740" d="1889">Looping process</p>
<p t="821629" d="3950">that that differentiates out into both the chicken and the egg so</p>
<p t="826069" d="3770">but what the question is what do you need in order for that process to begin and</p>
<p t="830540" d="7579">That&#39;s really the question of what the fundamental constituent elements of reality are and the mythological hypothesis. Is that there&#39;s or three or four?</p>
<p t="838850" d="6380">One is the fact that there has to be something that that that that manifests itself as an observer</p>
<p t="845230" d="4829">It&#39;s something like that some kind of observer now where that process of observation</p>
<p t="850459" d="6409">Starts in the Phylogenetic chain is very very difficult to tell you know we might say well. There&#39;s certainly nothing</p>
<p t="857540" d="3529">Of a conscious observer until there&#39;s a differentiated nervous system</p>
<p t="861069" d="3750">But then prior to the emergence of differentiated nervous systems there were</p>
<p t="865069" d="6710">Animals that were complex enough to react with the environment in a manner that well single-celled animals. They&#39;re quite complex</p>
<p t="871779" d="6269">I mean some of them are unbelievably complicated. You know they can move themselves through space they can orient they can follow chemical trails</p>
<p t="878269" d="2720">They&#39;re not they&#39;re not stupid by any stretch of the imagination</p>
<p t="881629" d="2000">now to what degree</p>
<p t="884389" d="7280">They have being you know as something they could represent well. We don&#39;t have to speculate on that, but the proto elements of</p>
<p t="892399" d="4669">Conscious being are there so you need you need a being you need?</p>
<p t="897920" d="3139">that the structure of that being through which the</p>
<p t="902389" d="3140">The entirety of being itself is interpreted and you need</p>
<p t="906470" d="6380">The surround it&#39;s something like that and so I conceptualize that as something that knows that&#39;s the knower</p>
<p t="913670" d="5209">what it knows that&#39;s the interpretive structure and that which needs to be known or</p>
<p t="919610" d="2569">you could could conceptualize that as the</p>
<p t="922910" d="2000">individual in</p>
<p t="925160" d="3859">explored territory nested inside unexplored territory</p>
<p t="929089" d="3679">That&#39;s another way of thinking about it or you can think about it as the individual</p>
<p t="933230" d="6619">Inside culture and the individual culture has nested inside nature that&#39;s another way of looking at it, or you can think of it</p>
<p t="939850" d="3959">but as the knower and in order surrounded by Chaos</p>
<p t="944710" d="3630">That&#39;s another way of thinking about it, but all these things you know, they&#39;re all attempts to</p>
<p t="949040" d="5690">Articulate the same underlying structure you see that in narratives continually</p>
<p t="954730" d="3269">And I think pinocchio is a very good example of that because in pinocchio you have</p>
<p t="958820" d="2090">the culture, that&#39;s Geppetto and</p>
<p t="961820" d="2000">Geppetto is obviously creative, but also</p>
<p t="964670" d="890">insufficient and dead</p>
<p t="965560" d="3300">Which is why he ends up in the belly of the whale you have the blue fairy</p>
<p t="969110" d="2959">whose mother Nature for all intents and purposes the</p>
<p t="972500" d="7010">Negative feminine doesn&#39;t manifest itself much in the pinocchio story except implicitly in the form of the whale the thing at the bottom that</p>
<p t="979610" d="4429">which is more like the dragon of Chaos than something feminine that swallows up the</p>
<p t="984710" d="8000">swallows Up culture, but you have Nature or culture Geppetto Nature the blue Fairy and then the puppet pinocchio and</p>
<p t="993530" d="7130">You know from a strictly scientific perspective. We think of human beings as nothing, but the children of nature and culture and that</p>
<p t="1001630" d="3410">Pushes You Towards a kind of deterministic view what causes your behavior?</p>
<p t="1005040" d="2489">Well, it&#39;s either nature or culture because there isn&#39;t anything else</p>
<p t="1007780" d="4400">But that isn&#39;t how the mythological story lays itself out because it says there is something else</p>
<p t="1012180" d="6839">And that&#39;s whatever your consciousness is and that consciousness seems to be able to work with nature and culture in a non</p>
<p t="1019240" d="2720">deterministic Manner in order to bring</p>
<p t="1022840" d="2000">Well in order for what?</p>
<p t="1026830" d="5269">In order to bring itself forward I mean and that&#39;s really and what&#39;s interesting about that</p>
<p t="1032100" d="2970">I think is that it isn&#39;t obviously just the plot of pinocchio</p>
<p t="1035070" d="4679">It&#39;s virtually the plot of any story is the story of the development of the individual now</p>
<p t="1040540" d="1740">the Story is</p>
<p t="1042280" d="1890">order Chaos</p>
<p t="1044170" d="6890">Higher order Roughly speaking so you can get variants of that you can get order collapses into disorder and nothing is</p>
<p t="1052450" d="7069">Resolved that&#39;s a tragedy right and and you can get so so you don&#39;t have to have the entire story</p>
<p t="1060670" d="2150">Represented in this story, but you get fragments of it</p>
<p t="1062820" d="1590">It&#39;s a classic u-shaped story</p>
<p t="1064410" d="5520">And what it is is the story of the development of the individual across time as a consequence of his or her?</p>
<p t="1070090" d="4910">adventures in time and space and every story is exactly that and</p>
<p t="1075490" d="6630">Those are representations of the manner in which you come to be in the world for better or for worse</p>
<p t="1082220" d="5510">It&#39;s differentiated so the individual has a negative and a pause development and culture has a negative and a positive</p>
<p t="1088010" d="5569">Element the Nature does as well and that makes the potential for plots much broader</p>
<p t="1094250" d="1050">but and</p>
<p t="1095300" d="5390">I think it&#39;s also very useful to know that entire story because I think it&#39;s one of the things that protects you against</p>
<p t="1100760" d="1340">Ideology it&#39;s like okay</p>
<p t="1102100" d="5190">Where if someone tells you a political story or a story of any sort you can always ask well?</p>
<p t="1107290" d="2699">Where are the missing characters human beings are terrible?</p>
<p t="1109990" d="6479">They directed a culture that&#39;s destroying the planet and nature is been if you know benevolent and and pristine</p>
<p t="1116470" d="3390">It&#39;s like yeah fair enough accurate, but you missing half the characters</p>
<p t="1120560" d="2000">Because humans are not just terrible</p>
<p t="1122810" d="5750">rapacious creatures and culture is not just a destructive force and nature is by no means on our side, so</p>
<p t="1129290" d="5270">Where&#39;s the missing characters you need all the characters in the representation to get it right?</p>
<p t="1134660" d="2989">And I really believe this to be true. So for example</p>
<p t="1138290" d="3530">If you want to protect yourself against trauma as you move forward in life</p>
<p t="1142010" d="7550">You have to be very aware of the three three negative characters you have to know that the human individual has an adversarial element</p>
<p t="1149560" d="6989">That&#39;s malevolent right to the core and if you don&#39;t know that and you run across someone who&#39;s malevolent you will end up damaged</p>
<p t="1157010" d="2449">So because first you won&#39;t be able to defend yourself</p>
<p t="1159460" d="5160">You&#39;ll just be like a ripe fruit tree for the plucking and second the mere existence of someone like that</p>
<p t="1164840" d="6170">will pose such a threat to the way that you&#39;ve organized the world that it might collapse on you that happens to people all the</p>
<p t="1171010" d="3089">Time so it really matters whether you know these categories</p>
<p t="1174100" d="2280">and it matters that you know that culture can become</p>
<p t="1176450" d="890">Tyrannical it really</p>
<p t="1177340" d="4440">But that it&#39;s also you&#39;re the father that&#39;s given you everything and it matters that you know</p>
<p t="1181880" d="3979">Everything good comes from nature and that we need to live in harmony with Nature to some degree</p>
<p t="1185860" d="2280">But that it&#39;s also hell bent on our destruction</p>
<p t="1188750" d="2810">Every second and it&#39;s very paradoxical</p>
<p t="1191870" d="5930">It&#39;s a hard thing to reconcile with with with a with a thought structure like modern science</p>
<p t="1197800" d="5189">That&#39;s based on a strict logic that always says something can&#39;t be itself and it&#39;s opposite at the same time</p>
<p t="1202990" d="2310">But you know human beings can certainly be</p>
<p t="1206210" d="4730">something and it&#39;s opposite at the same time and anything truly complex can have the</p>
<p t="1211070" d="5669">And does have that nature if someone offers you a new job you think well? That&#39;s positive. It&#39;s like no, it&#39;s not</p>
<p t="1217560" d="5959">It&#39;s positive and negative and complex it might be the solution to your problem, but at the same set time</p>
<p t="1223520" d="3420">It&#39;s going to generate a whole host of other problems so lots of times</p>
<p t="1228000" d="2000">We&#39;re encountering</p>
<p t="1230070" d="5329">entities in some sense that have an internally paradoxical structure and we have to deal with that entire set of</p>
<p t="1235620" d="3380">Paradoxes or or we don&#39;t survive it&#39;s really a matter of survival</p>
<p t="1239700" d="1560">okay, so</p>
<p t="1241260" d="6500">So on and then you know there&#39;s this overarching symbol which is the dragon of Chaos which is potential itself</p>
<p t="1247760" d="4469">and it&#39;s the potential from which all of these categories Emerge and so the</p>
<p t="1253590" d="7579">The most abstract category of our imagination is that which is beyond our understanding the category of that which is Beyond our understanding?</p>
<p t="1261510" d="2000">and that seems to me to be</p>
<p t="1264210" d="5299">represented because we can only use the representational structures that we evolved is that it&#39;s</p>
<p t="1270060" d="7609">represented in our paradoxical representation of the predator and the treasure that lies Beyond the perimeter is the</p>
<p t="1278340" d="1920">perimeters of our safe</p>
<p t="1280260" d="3050">Societies, so what&#39;s out there Beyond well?</p>
<p t="1283310" d="5099">We don&#39;t know, but we need to know because we need always to deal with what we don&#39;t know so weirdly enough</p>
<p t="1288410" d="5489">We have to come up with a category of what we don&#39;t know in order to start formalizing a theory about how we might</p>
<p t="1295110" d="6140">Progress towards it and interact with it. It&#39;s a very paradoxical idea, and there&#39;s a paradoxical answer, right?</p>
<p t="1301250" d="4470">It&#39;s the terrible predator that lurks in the unknown that also harbors something of great value</p>
<p t="1306570" d="1080">perfect</p>
<p t="1307650" d="5900">Perfect that&#39;s exactly right that&#39;s exactly right and and I think that that is a reflection of the fact that human beings are</p>
<p t="1313920" d="7760">Predator animal and prey animals at the same time so what&#39;s out there in the terrible darkness something that can destroy you?</p>
<p t="1322050" d="4429">But also something that you absolutely need so how do you how do you?</p>
<p t="1327000" d="2780">Prepare yourself for that, and that&#39;s the ultimate question of life</p>
<p t="1330210" d="5719">It&#39;s not how do you deal with death although death is a sub component of the terrible unknown I would say it&#39;s how do you</p>
<p t="1335930" d="3299">Deal with that which is Beyond your understanding which is constantly</p>
<p t="1339600" d="4759">Manifesting itself in the world and that and that manifests itself every time you</p>
<p t="1344570" d="3930">categorize something and the thing escapes from the category and that happens most</p>
<p t="1349019" d="5210">interpersonal relationships because people are so damn complicated you get them figured out boxed in you can make a</p>
<p t="1354419" d="5359">Contract that neither of you will jump outside the box, but you jump outside the box continually</p>
<p t="1359779" d="1390">And that&#39;s why a relationship</p>
<p t="1361169" d="7640">requires constant negotiation and reconceptualize ation because you do not exhaust the person with your perceptual categories and</p>
<p t="1369120" d="3469">Of course you don&#39;t exhaust the world with your perceptual categories ever</p>
<p t="1373139" d="1530">This is partly. Why the</p>
<p t="1374669" d="7130">Existentialist, or they have this concept called alienation and the idea was that human beings become alienated from their creative products?</p>
<p t="1382139" d="3020">so and that is and here&#39;s why it happens, so</p>
<p t="1385980" d="1350">Imagine</p>
<p t="1387330" d="6349">Henry Ford makes the assembly line right so ford has no idea what&#39;s going to happen when he makes the assembly line like because he&#39;s</p>
<p t="1393679" d="3900">Just trying to figure out a fast way to make cars or he thinks that what he&#39;s making his cars</p>
<p t="1397580" d="5760">So he thinks he&#39;s making an assembly line for cars, and he thinks he&#39;s making cars, and you think well</p>
<p t="1403340" d="2729">What&#39;s wrong with that? Well first of all the assembly line absolutely?</p>
<p t="1406860" d="2959">Transformed the entire planet right because it</p>
<p t="1410370" d="3589">Brought in that the era of mass cheap manufacturing. It&#39;s like</p>
<p t="1413960" d="7559">It&#39;s just it was way more than he thought it was and then did he make a car well a car is something that</p>
<p t="1421919" d="5780">Hypothetically takes you relatively effectively from point a to point b. It was really a replacement for the horse and buggy</p>
<p t="1427700" d="3959">I mean if the first cars looked like that they were horseless carriages</p>
<p t="1431809" d="521">well</p>
<p t="1432330" d="4219">Did he make a car well God it&#39;s God it&#39;s hard to tell what Henry ford made</p>
<p t="1436889" d="3410">He made a very effective way for transforming the atmosphere, right?</p>
<p t="1441029" d="4400">And the fact that it also happened to take you from point a to point B might be just completely irrelevant</p>
<p t="1445679" d="6050">compared to the fact that it was the internal combustion engine and its rapid distribution completely changed the</p>
<p t="1452370" d="2000">Constituent that you know the fundamental</p>
<p t="1454919" d="2510">Chemical structure of the atmosphere itself it</p>
<p t="1457799" d="1980">Completely transformed cities it</p>
<p t="1459779" d="6590">Blew out the rural community everyone moved to the cities right it made all the cities built around the automobile</p>
<p t="1466370" d="3750">But then it had this tremendous political and economic significance, too</p>
<p t="1470279" d="2960">So I mean part of the reason that because you think well is</p>
<p t="1473519" d="4490">A car is a way to get from point a to point B. But no no it&#39;s not a machine</p>
<p t="1478580" d="6510">It&#39;s also the embodiment of an idea. It&#39;s a very strange idea a collectivist society would have never invented the car</p>
<p t="1485759" d="2900">because the car is predicated on the idea that you could own a</p>
<p t="1489210" d="6529">Conveyance that would get only you and only you from somewhere to somewhere else without ever asking anybody for any</p>
<p t="1496320" d="1289">permission and</p>
<p t="1497609" d="4609">So the funny thing is is when you build something like that those presuppositions are built into it</p>
<p t="1502219" d="3210">and then when you export that say to soviet Russia</p>
<p t="1505559" d="4819">You don&#39;t get to they can&#39;t just take the car and leave the political implications behind</p>
<p t="1510899" d="7339">The car the foot Mere fact that you stepped into one and drive it is an indication that you&#39;re accepting the political ideological</p>
<p t="1519659" d="6319">Presuppositions that are part of the fact that that thing even exists and so well that&#39;s alienation, it&#39;s like</p>
<p t="1526950" d="5869">Even something you make you think well you have control over what you make because you&#39;ve made it you understand</p>
<p t="1532820" d="4049">It&#39;s like no, you don&#39;t you understand a tiny fraction of it you launch it out in the world man</p>
<p t="1536869" d="5640">And the snakes inside of it the hydra Xinhai inside of it multiply their heads massively</p>
<p t="1542909" d="4219">Constantly and you can you can&#39;t really keep track of it and so</p>
<p t="1547679" d="5780">So even even in your relationship with create identities. You still see the re-emergence of this underlying</p>
<p t="1554219" d="7400">Fundamental sub structure right even inside it&#39;s the it&#39;s the garden of eden there&#39;s always a snake inside the thing this wall did always</p>
<p t="1561809" d="6020">Always all even God himself could not get rid of the snakes in the garden and partly what that means is that?</p>
<p t="1568109" d="4310">You know the garden is a conceptual system. It&#39;s the conceptual system within which people</p>
<p t="1572940" d="2659">Exist that Eden is a is a walled Garden</p>
<p t="1576149" d="1730">Paradise means walled Garden</p>
<p t="1577879" d="5520">And it&#39;s walls because a walled garden is where people live because the wall is culture and the garden is nature</p>
<p t="1583399" d="4829">And we always live in a structure that&#39;s an amalgam of nature and culture so we set it up</p>
<p t="1588229" d="2820">So it&#39;s paradisal as long as we&#39;re unconscious</p>
<p t="1591049" d="2280">But we can&#39;t manage it because there&#39;s always something</p>
<p t="1593460" d="6169">Chaotic that&#39;s coming in that we will interact with that&#39;s human beings you put a snake in the garden. It&#39;s the first bloody thing</p>
<p t="1599629" d="3989">We&#39;re going to talk to and for better, or worse. It makes us conscious and awake</p>
<p t="1603719" d="1920">It makes us aware of our mortality</p>
<p t="1605639" d="7370">It does all sorts of terrible things to us, but it doesn&#39;t matter because that&#39;s that&#39;s the path that human beings have what chosen?</p>
<p t="1613650" d="6019">Because that&#39;s the implication in that story and and it&#39;s very difficult. It&#39;s a very difficult thing to answer because</p>
<p t="1620880" d="7880">We certainly choose each other for self-awareness and consciousness and intelligence, and I don&#39;t you know if you&#39;re if you&#39;re choosing a mate</p>
<p t="1630179" d="7489">There&#39;s an arms race in human beings. We&#39;re choosing intelligent mate, especially that&#39;s especially the case for women in relationship to men, so</p>
<p t="1639630" d="2209">So that the idea is that that&#39;s a choice</p>
<p t="1641840" d="4859">Well, that&#39;s partly why it&#39;s Eva that makes Adam self-conscious in the garden of Eden right she offers him the apple</p>
<p t="1646700" d="6239">She&#39;s the one that makes him self-conscious. I think that&#39;s actually accurate because the evidence from the evolutionary biologist</p>
<p t="1652940" d="7590">Is that human sexual females sexual selection was one of the driving factors that differentiated us for Chimpanzees? It&#39;s a major factor</p>
<p t="1661320" d="4969">Chimpanzee females are not selective Mater&#39;s they go into Estrus. They&#39;ll mate with anything</p>
<p t="1666480" d="3380">What happens is the dominant Males Chase the Subordinate males away?</p>
<p t="1669860" d="2520">And so they end up leaving more offspring</p>
<p t="1672380" d="6150">but it&#39;s not a consequence of selection on the part of the females and human beings it&#39;s completely different concealed ovulation and</p>
<p t="1679230" d="5420">Intense selection pressure from women on men you have twice as many female ancestors as you have male ancestors</p>
<p t="1685350" d="3979">People can never have a hard time working that oh, there is medically, but it&#39;s not that</p>
<p t="1690150" d="3380">Problematic you just think on average every woman had one child</p>
<p t="1694440" d="2660">half of men had none and the other half had two and</p>
<p t="1697620" d="5569">That&#39;s approximately correct if you average across the entire history of human sexuality</p>
<p t="1703710" d="5329">So human males in particular are subject to vicious selection pressure on the part of females</p>
<p t="1709039" d="4230">And I also think that&#39;s partly why nature is represented</p>
<p t="1714059" d="5420">Symbolically as female among human beings because after all nature is what selects</p>
<p t="1719480" d="4260">There&#39;s no better definition of Nature than that which selects</p>
<p t="1724380" d="1350">so</p>
<p t="1725730" d="5689">now so so here&#39;s here&#39;s what I want to talk to you about the brain a little bit because if you make the radical case</p>
<p t="1731419" d="3570">let&#39;s say that these are actually the categories of reality and</p>
<p t="1735539" d="5180">We&#39;re going to say well reality is what select for the for the sake of for this for the sake of argument?</p>
<p t="1741600" d="1020">then</p>
<p t="1742620" d="7640">the then are our neurological struck our physical structure should be adapted to that reality it&#39;s it&#39;s a</p>
<p t="1750750" d="840">necessary conclusion</p>
<p t="1751590" d="590">from that</p>
<p t="1752180" d="4859">So then the question is well are they and as far as I can tell the answer to that is yes?</p>
<p t="1757040" d="2220">and so we&#39;ll go through the</p>
<p t="1760050" d="6770">What would Neuro psychological evidence quite rapidly the first bit of evidence? Is that you have two hemispheres? Why?</p>
<p t="1768390" d="4909">One deals with unknown and the other deals with the known that&#39;s Alcona and goldberg. That&#39;s that</p>
<p t="1773640" d="3709">hypothesize completely independently of any of this underlying mythological substructure</p>
<p t="1777350" d="2790">which is really important thing to note because if</p>
<p t="1780540" d="6859">You&#39;re trying to determine whether or not something is true valid if it&#39;s the construct upon. Which you base your thinking are</p>
<p t="1787830" d="1140">valid and true</p>
<p t="1788970" d="5809">There&#39;s rules for doing that and one of the rules is you have to be able to detect the existence of the categories?</p>
<p t="1794910" d="2000">using multiple methods of of</p>
<p t="1799170" d="5060">What using multiple methods, it&#39;s the Multi method Multi trait Matrix, technically speaking</p>
<p t="1804420" d="5270">It was established as a technique by two psychologists named cronbach, cro</p>

<p t="1816830" d="5760">How do you determine if something actually has an existence like anger or anxiety that&#39;s something that you could study?</p>
<p t="1822900" d="2750">Scientifically, and the answer is well you have to be able to measure it</p>
<p t="1826170" d="5810">Multiple ways and all those measurements have to read the same way and then the question is well</p>
<p t="1831980" d="6000">what do you mean by multiple ways because it&#39;s sight and vision in sight and hearing different or</p>
<p t="1838320" d="5239">Somewhat and somewhat to say, but you know you make them as different as you can manage</p>

<p t="1853290" d="7460">gas around you or some liquid in order for that to occur sight uses light you know we&#39;re using different inputs that converge and</p>
<p t="1860910" d="6619">Allow us to say well if we get convergence information across these multiple measurements, then we&#39;ll assume that the thing we&#39;re perceiving is real</p>
<p t="1867840" d="5030">We even extend that in science because we say if you take your multiple measurement system</p>
<p t="1872870" d="3089">And you take your multiple multiple measurement system</p>
<p t="1875960" d="5369">and then you compare them will only allow what&#39;s corn to cross both those comparisons to be real and</p>
<p t="1881550" d="4579">so that&#39;s the Multi method multi trait Matrix process essentially and</p>
<p t="1887730" d="5540">My sense is that you know I think that the pattern that I&#39;m describing to you is manifested itself</p>
<p t="1893640" d="6500">evolutionarily it manifests itself at the neural in the neurological space and it manifests itself in the conceptual space and the</p>
<p t="1900360" d="3349">probabilities of all three of those things happening at the same time</p>
<p t="1904290" d="2390">without there being something valid there is</p>
<p t="1907650" d="4099">Lessons with each level of interpretation you managed to stack on top of one another</p>
<p t="1912360" d="2390">So that&#39;s that&#39;s the method well, so</p>
<p t="1915330" d="3799">Let&#39;s think about the brain a little bit, and I&#39;ll tell you a little bit about how the brain works</p>
<p t="1920100" d="2000">and</p>
<p t="1922980" d="1320">and</p>
<p t="1924300" d="2539">You know a lot of the stuff. I&#39;m telling you right now is quite</p>
<p t="1926840" d="3869">Old actually most of it was worked out in the nineteen in the 1980s</p>
<p t="1930750" d="3500">But it&#39;s been remarkably stable as far as I can tell in some sense</p>
<p t="1934250" d="5040">We&#39;re filling in the details and not in every sense, but in some sense, we&#39;re filling in the details, okay</p>
<p t="1939290" d="6929">So you take this is from Alexander, Luria who was the the greatest perhaps the greatest neuropsychologist who ever lived?</p>
<p t="1947070" d="1560">He was a russian</p>
<p t="1948630" d="5300">What worked mostly up to the second world war mostly on people who had brain damage and he was interested in?</p>
<p t="1954090" d="2000">trying to outline the the</p>
<p t="1958650" d="5540">Overarching picture of brain function, and so he did that partly by looking at its function</p>
<p t="1964190" d="4769">But also partly by looking at its structure trying to get both of those things working simultaneously</p>
<p t="1968960" d="5760">And so we&#39;ll go through a brief picture of how the brain works and so one of the ways of so</p>
<p t="1975180" d="3949">You can you can look at the brain from front to back and you can divide it roughly into two?</p>
<p t="1979410" d="6229">Sections in one section has to do with sensory processing and that&#39;s roughly the back half and one section has to do with motor</p>
<p t="1986040" d="2719">Output now those things aren&#39;t as clearly</p>
<p t="1989160" d="6199">Differentiated as you might think because you there&#39;s very little sensation without motor output. Maybe the</p>
<p t="1996120" d="4760">The part that closest to an exception is smell I would say but you at least have to breathe in</p>
<p t="2000980" d="5780">You know and when an animal is actively searching on a scent trail its breathing in so it&#39;s using its motor output</p>
<p t="2006920" d="1910">constantly to modify the Sensory Stream</p>
<p t="2008830" d="6119">It&#39;s really difficult to dissociate the two it when you&#39;re looking at some you know it kind of feels to you like you&#39;re a passive</p>
<p t="2015200" d="1650">recipient of sense data</p>
<p t="2016850" d="3889">But you&#39;re no such thing your eyes are moving back and forth in</p>
<p t="2021200" d="4819">Multiple ways all the time including the ways that you can control voluntarily</p>
<p t="2026020" d="6180">so there&#39;s multiple involuntary systems that are moving your eyes in multiple ways and really what you&#39;re doing is feeling the the</p>
<p t="2033110" d="1260">array of</p>
<p t="2034370" d="7400">Electro-Magnetic of the electromagnetic spectrum with your eyes you&#39;re feeling it you&#39;re actively exploring if you&#39;re not a passive recipient at all</p>
<p t="2042050" d="1860">so even in</p>
<p t="2043910" d="4099">Sensation you can&#39;t purely pull sensation out for motor</p>
<p t="2048590" d="4639">Processing and say I&#39;m getting untrammeled unbiased sense data because you can&#39;t</p>
<p t="2053780" d="6050">Look at something without focusing and you can&#39;t focus without wanting to look at something</p>
<p t="2059830" d="5429">You know you can&#39;t just lie there with it. Well you could with your eyes have cross, but you know that&#39;s sort of like</p>
<p t="2066620" d="6139">Imagine you dropped a video recorder from an airplane, and it just spun around in an unfocused Manner. Well, that&#39;s the world</p>
<p t="2073460" d="3500">Sampled randomly, you know what are you going to do with that nothing?</p>
<p t="2076960" d="5610">and you know you&#39;re you&#39;re concentrating on the on on the auditory stream constantly and</p>
<p t="2083450" d="4430">Segregating out some things and suppressing others like if you listen in the classroom</p>
<p t="2090530" d="2000">you can hear</p>
<p t="2092810" d="4609">Probably four or five different types of mechanical noise going on at the same time</p>
<p t="2098390" d="1680">most of the time in the classroom</p>
<p t="2100070" d="1220">That&#39;s silent</p>
<p t="2101290" d="4709">You don&#39;t hear it like you don&#39;t hear your fridge except when it turns on or off right you zero that out</p>
<p t="2106000" d="2910">And so you&#39;re very selective in your perception</p>
<p t="2109550" d="5179">So you can&#39;t really technically separate out motor output from Sensory input</p>
<p t="2114730" d="6239">And that&#39;s really useful to know because it destroys the idea that you&#39;re just a pet you know that there&#39;s a world of</p>
<p t="2121160" d="6589">Sensation out there, that&#39;s imprinting itself on you, and that&#39;s how you get your information. Which is really the that&#39;s the fundamental</p>
<p t="2128450" d="6110">Presupposition of the empiricists of the raw empiricists there&#39;s a world of sense data out there you sample it randomly</p>
<p t="2134560" d="2000">And that&#39;s what informs like yes</p>
<p t="2136970" d="2000">Except that you&#39;re always an active</p>
<p t="2139490" d="1430">harvester of the information</p>
<p t="2140920" d="4320">so you can&#39;t get rid of the interpretive structure a priori that was a manual cat by the</p>
<p t="2145500" d="6870">Who first established out in his critique of pure reason you can&#39;t get away from the fact that you&#39;re actively harvesting the data</p>
<p t="2152560" d="5179">So you can say well where is human structure come from defense data. That&#39;s sort of the blank slate idea</p>
<p t="2157740" d="4800">It&#39;s like no wrong because a blank slate cannot process information</p>
<p t="2162880" d="6110">You&#39;re actively engaged right at the beginning. So that&#39;s another example of the knower and the unknown you know</p>
<p t="2169690" d="5660">Working in the cyclical Manner because you interact with something you divide it up into</p>
<p t="2176320" d="1650">You you and the world</p>
<p t="2177970" d="4219">Roughly speaking, and I mean you really make it that way because you build yourself out of the information</p>
<p t="2182190" d="2000">And then of course that makes you a more</p>
<p t="2184570" d="5540">Differentiated processor with a broader range of skills then you interact with the unknown again you Gather more information</p>
<p t="2190600" d="3169">It differentiates the world it makes you a more differentiated</p>
<p t="2194350" d="7729">Harvester, and then so it&#39;s just continually cycling and that consciousness the logos the knower is that thing that&#39;s doing that</p>
<p t="2202420" d="3920">Harvesting and you can never say it&#39;s not there now</p>
<p t="2206340" d="6449">what happens is that it&#39;s in its nascent form to begin with Low resolution nascent form Low resolution or</p>
<p t="2213370" d="3349">Low resolution Category system Low resolution world</p>
<p t="2216970" d="7070">But that&#39;s enough to kick started and to started differentiating and that happens as you develop as an individual</p>
<p t="2224650" d="5720">Because you start out as a single-celled organism for all intents and purposes a very low resolution</p>
<p t="2230740" d="6739">Thing in a very low resolution world and that differentiates itself across time, but exactly the same thing happened over evolutionary time</p>
<p t="2238150" d="1170">so</p>
<p t="2239320" d="6589">So there isn&#39;t a time when those three elements aren&#39;t there for all intents and purposes. They&#39;re always there</p>
<p t="2245910" d="6000">They&#39;re permanent okay, so anyways back to the brain since sensory unit. That&#39;s the that&#39;s the</p>
<p t="2252880" d="6200">Back half Roughly speaking huge chunk of that is devoted to visual processing in human beings right most animals</p>
<p t="2259210" d="7010">Organized around smells not us some what still can smell is a very powerful evoker of memories</p>
<p t="2266220" d="1780">And it has a direct</p>
<p t="2268000" d="1350">relationship with</p>
<p t="2269350" d="5689">Emotional systems because you need to know if something is edible or inedible terrible or or good very very rapidly</p>
<p t="2275290" d="2239">But human beings are organized around vision</p>
<p t="2277530" d="3690">so we have a map of massive amounts of our Cortex devoted to</p>
<p t="2281710" d="7369">Differentiated visual processing now the motor unit so what you have is each of these little zones here, so for example</p>
<p t="2289840" d="1200">Look at the back here</p>
<p t="2291040" d="1320">that&#39;s the</p>
<p t="2292360" d="4909">Primary visual area and the Secondary visual area and then this is the primary auditory</p>
<p t="2297490" d="6079">area in the middle of the brain here on the outside and the secondary auditory area and then the</p>
<p t="2304240" d="1170">the</p>
<p t="2305410" d="7820">This is for body representation the primary area in the secondary area and you can think about those those areas of primary</p>
<p t="2313570" d="7940">primary Secondary and then tertiary primary does the base level processing tertiary expands that up into more abstract represent a</p>
<p t="2321940" d="6020">Secondary expands it up into more abstract representations and tertiary are the areas where the senses come together?</p>
<p t="2327960" d="3989">And that&#39;s really what what you seem to be most conscious of right?</p>
<p t="2332440" d="4520">it&#39;s action in the tertiary areas because you don&#39;t really see the world as a</p>
<p t="2337420" d="4399">Separate you can think about the auditory streams separate from the visual stream and all of that</p>
<p t="2341820" d="4890">And you can think about touch separately, but you tend to consciously experience things as a unity</p>
<p t="2349000" d="3289">As a comprehensive unity of all the senses simultaneously</p>
<p t="2352360" d="5300">So consciousness seems to occur only at that most of the time at the highest level of integration</p>
<p t="2357660" d="6929">And you&#39;ll area would have associated consciousness more with the tertiary areas where this where the senses are talking to one another now</p>
<p t="2364590" d="2000">It&#39;s more complicated than that because there&#39;s obviously</p>
<p t="2367150" d="6830">subcortical structures all the way down to the spine that are involved heavily in what consciousness is it&#39;s not merely a</p>
<p t="2374080" d="2000">consequence of cortical</p>
<p t="2376300" d="4550">Activity you know we tend to think that because human beings have massively expanded</p>
<p t="2381700" d="4939">Cortical structures, and we think of ourselves as the most conscious creatures, and that&#39;s reasonable</p>
<p t="2386640" d="3540">But you can take an awful lot of cortex off someone and they&#39;re still conscious</p>
<p t="2390460" d="3439">In fact you can leave them with almost no brain at all, and they&#39;re still conscious</p>
<p t="2393900" d="5820">So we really have a rough time trying to figure out what consciousness is and how it&#39;s related to brain structure</p>
<p t="2400960" d="2000">so</p>
<p t="2403660" d="5479">Anyway, so that&#39;s the sensory and then the motor unit you have the primary</p>
<p t="2410140" d="7369">Unit the secondary unit and the primo or the prefrontal Cortex and prefrontal Cortex is particularly a huge and human being so imagine that</p>
<p t="2417670" d="3560">It&#39;s this primary and secondary areas that allow you to</p>
<p t="2422049" d="7219">- first of all to Act voluntarily, and then - and then to play around in some sense with your actions you know like</p>
<p t="2430180" d="7699">Imagine that imagine that you&#39;re a child building with legos and you can sync with the legos without without really having to think abstractly</p>
<p t="2438130" d="5689">right because you can play around and build different sorts of structures until you can think at the level at A</p>
<p t="2444250" d="3229">Level of motor output without having to depend on abstraction</p>
<p t="2447549" d="3140">but if you develop the Prefrontal Cortex</p>
<p t="2451000" d="5029">here which emerged out of the motor and premotor areas over the course of evolution so it&#39;s a</p>
<p t="2456369" d="3770">Differentiation of those structures, so this is dealing with the real world</p>
<p t="2460210" d="2149">This is dealing mostly with the real world</p>
<p t="2462359" d="7620">But starting to abstract and experiment a little bit and then this what this part deals with abstractions pure and simple so you</p>
<p t="2470589" d="6949">know I can I can I can lift this and then I can play with lifting it and then I can put it aside and</p>
<p t="2477819" d="2000">Think about it</p>
<p t="2479890" d="3889">Abstractly I can think about all the different things that I might do with it. I say well, I could throw it</p>
<p t="2483779" d="3300">I could take it apart. I could throw I could toss it in the air. I could juggle it</p>
<p t="2487079" d="5489">I could use it as a doorstop right I could kick it across the room and so basically what I&#39;m doing there is I&#39;m</p>
<p t="2492910" d="3109">Using my prefrontal Cortex to generate an abstract</p>
<p t="2496390" d="7219">Representation of the world and then to plot out motor strategies before implementing them and that&#39;s basically what abstract thought is</p>
<p t="2503859" d="2870">very very fundamentally, it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p t="2507279" d="8000">it&#39;s the hypothesis of abstract action and then the analysis of the outcome and then the implementation into action and</p>
<p t="2515829" d="6290">I think that there&#39;s something about that that actually defines the difference between intelligence and conscientiousness</p>
<p t="2522579" d="5420">Because weirdly enough you know the correlation between intelligence and conscientiousness is zero</p>
<p t="2528819" d="7699">No relationship whatsoever. It&#39;s quite strange because conscientious people plan and and so forth but I think what it is is that?</p>
<p t="2537099" d="3830">intelligence is an indicator of the effectiveness of abstraction and</p>
<p t="2541539" d="5730">Conscientiousness is an indicator of the probability of implementation, and those are very very different problems</p>
<p t="2547549" d="6620">And you don&#39;t just go from abstraction to implementation because if you did you wouldn&#39;t be able to think right the thinking has to be</p>
<p t="2554630" d="5239">Torn away from the implementation, or what you&#39;re doing isn&#39;t thinking it&#39;s just acting</p>
<p t="2560510" d="5599">So and so I think that accounts for the psychometric independence of those two phenomena</p>
<p t="2567619" d="5600">It&#39;s annoying because you can think of something that you should do, and you won&#39;t do it because there&#39;s no deterministic</p>
<p t="2573829" d="7250">causal pathway from the conception to the action so that&#39;s kind of annoying it seems to take something like willpower in order to Transform the</p>
<p t="2581569" d="2479">abstraction into an implementation and</p>
<p t="2585109" d="1920">We don&#39;t understand that very well</p>
<p t="2587029" d="2990">it&#39;s easy to understand the resistance to doing it because</p>
<p t="2590329" d="5030">Moke the default position of your body should be something like no it never do anything</p>
<p t="2596390" d="2000">except eat, you know because</p>
<p t="2598849" d="6469">Doing something requires the expenditure of energy and resources and so unless you have a really good rationale for it</p>
<p t="2605319" d="2640">You should probably not do it and so the body is sort of</p>
<p t="2609170" d="7189">Intransigent by Nature it&#39;s an oversimplification. You have to come up with a good reason to impel it into motion and you should because</p>
<p t="2617180" d="5750">You have to pay for action you have to pay for it with energy and resources, so there should be resistance against it</p>
<p t="2622930" d="6359">but it&#39;s still annoying so ok so that&#39;s one way of thinking about the world the world something to sense and</p>
<p t="2629539" d="4400">the world something to act upon and so the brain has fundamental divisions of</p>
<p t="2634789" d="5390">Sensing and acting upon, but there, it&#39;s a constantly interacting loop. You. Can&#39;t separate them really</p>
<p t="2641660" d="3709">Any more than we are separating them conceptually now</p>
<p t="2647839" d="2540">on the Motor strip</p>
<p t="2653000" d="2000">here</p>
<p t="2656230" d="4190">The body is represented and this was discovered at the Montreal neurological institute</p>
<p t="2663340" d="7340">When when when brain surgery was been doing was being done on on on people generally who had epilepsy or some other?</p>
<p t="2670780" d="1980">Terrible Brain illness</p>
<p t="2672760" d="2120">You have brain surgery when you&#39;re awake</p>
<p t="2675220" d="5870">Which is a rather horrifying thing to know about but the reason for that generally speaking is so that?</p>
<p t="2682210" d="2000">Something isn&#39;t taken out that you need</p>
<p t="2684880" d="5899">Now one of the things that happened while people were having brain surgery done, and this would have been I believe I</p>
<p t="2691330" d="2000">Don&#39;t remember the exact time</p>
<p t="2693460" d="2329">between the 30s and the 50s, I believe</p>
<p t="2697840" d="4850">And I think it was hab if I remember properly who was one of Canada&#39;s great neuropsychologist?</p>
<p t="2703570" d="5929">We do brain stimulation while people were having brain surgery and they could map out the way the body was</p>
<p t="2709720" d="4970">Represented on the cortical surface, and so you imagine. There&#39;s two representations. There&#39;s there&#39;s a</p>
<p t="2715240" d="4580">Sensory representation of your body on the cortical Surface, and there&#39;s a motor</p>
<p t="2720370" d="5149">Representation of your body on the cortical surface those are both called the representations are called homunculus</p>
<p t="2725860" d="4580">They&#39;re like the body has been laid out on this strange strip, or this strip of tissue</p>
<p t="2730510" d="3440">you can look up the homunculi and see what they&#39;re like, but I&#39;ll show you uh</p>
<p t="2734860" d="2389">They&#39;re sort of stretched out weirdly</p>
<p t="2739990" d="1740">along here</p>
<p t="2741730" d="4729">That would be the motor one and then along here that would be the sensory one and you can kind of</p>
<p t="2747010" d="6350">you can kind of detect with your own consciousness how your body is represented in your brain, so</p>
<p t="2753970" d="3410">For example can I get you to stand up if you would?</p>
<p t="2758290" d="2000">Let&#39;s turn around</p>
<p t="2760660" d="2750">Okay, so how many fingers on your back?</p>
<p t="2765760" d="6979">Okay, all right. Why low resolution. He&#39;s like a rope on the honor. His back is like a low resolution</p>
<p t="2774040" d="3979">Array of pixels right and so it&#39;s virtually impossible. You just don&#39;t have enough</p>
<p t="2778810" d="3590">Sensory tissue on your back to make that you could tell I was pushing</p>
<p t="2782680" d="3469">But it could have been a bath it could have been five fingers. It doesn&#39;t matter</p>
<p t="2786190" d="5759">maybe your pixel is this big or something like that right and so, but if I put a</p>
<p t="2792890" d="5540">Finger on your lip like that man. You&#39;ve got it right now or on your tongue because your tongue</p>
<p t="2798430" d="3839">there&#39;s more representative representation of your tongue than your entire trunk and</p>
<p t="2802849" d="5810">Well, why well you don&#39;t to bite your tongue? That&#39;s a big problem. You have to be able to talk you</p>
<p t="2809329" d="3590">You want to really differentiate what you&#39;re eating if you&#39;re eating fish?</p>
<p t="2812920" d="3300">You don&#39;t want to eat the bone so and you know when your tongue is</p>
<p t="2817220" d="4760">unbelievably crazily sensitive, and you know that to that if you have a tooth pulled</p>
<p t="2823069" d="5959">Your tongue will investigate that area for like six months what you&#39;re sitting there your attention</p>
<p t="2829309" d="6229">Wanes and your tongue is in there like mapping like mad mapping that little hole to update your body representation, right?</p>
<p t="2835539" d="2000">And it&#39;s just this crazy thing that is</p>
<p t="2838369" d="2000">unbelievably well</p>
<p t="2840410" d="7849">Represented set from the sensory perspective and also from the motor perspective because you could manipulate your tongue like crazy. It&#39;s it&#39;s like a</p>
<p t="2848960" d="2000">quarter of your motor output system is</p>
<p t="2851930" d="3589">devoted to tongue manipulation, right and so here&#39;s a</p>
<p t="2856430" d="3079">Here&#39;s a picture of the homunculus, this is a motor homunculus</p>
<p t="2860359" d="4250">So that&#39;s how that&#39;s what your brain thinks of your body that that&#39;s a good way of thinking about it</p>
<p t="2864609" d="3000">And so that&#39;s what a human being is like in terms of his or her</p>
<p t="2867680" d="7280">Output and so what you see if you look at a sensory homunculus, it&#39;s quite similar except the feet are bigger the genitalia are bigger</p>
<p t="2875480" d="5779">Logically they don&#39;t have much motor utility but they have a lot of sensory utility, but the rest of its quite similar</p>
<p t="2881259" d="3360">So there&#39;s you know the motor and the sensory homunculus are quite similar</p>
<p t="2884619" d="2729">But I&#39;m going to talk about the motor homunculus because it&#39;s sort of the action</p>
<p t="2888470" d="2000">Representation well so what are human beings like?</p>
<p t="2890869" d="2000">well</p>
<p t="2893480" d="4099">We&#39;re all hands that&#39;s the first thing you know and if you do that</p>
<p t="2898069" d="6110">There&#39;s no, it&#39;s unbelievably high resolution your fingertips and and and the and the that sensory</p>
<p t="2904180" d="5579">But we can manipulate our hands like crazy like they&#39;re unbelievably articulated, right?</p>
<p t="2909759" d="2970">And that&#39;s the thing that makes us able to change the world it makes us</p>
<p t="2912730" d="3929">What dolphins aren&#39;t and so a huge part of our brain is devoted?</p>
<p t="2917240" d="4729">Towards being able to move our hands that enables us to take things apart put them together</p>
<p t="2922730" d="2729">And then once we learn to take things apart and put them together</p>
<p t="2925740" d="1820">We can talk about how we do that</p>
<p t="2927560" d="4290">And that&#39;s a lot of what we&#39;re doing and that&#39;s the hands and the mouth and the tongue Roughly speaking</p>
<p t="2932130" d="2150">Here&#39;s how I took something to get apart</p>
<p t="2935010" d="2869">Chaos here&#39;s what I made out of it order</p>
<p t="2937950" d="7580">Here&#39;s how I did it, and then you receive that and you&#39;re happy about it, and then you can do the same thing that&#39;s invitation</p>
<p t="2946290" d="3439">Facilitated by language like here&#39;s what I did with my body. I&#39;m</p>
<p t="2950730" d="1950">propagating the cross space</p>
<p t="2952680" d="3199">You&#39;re taking it mapping it onto your body now</p>
<p t="2955880" d="1500">You can do the same thing. Yeah</p>
<p t="2957380" d="3060">And that&#39;s you know it might be simple like this is how you pick up a rock?</p>
<p t="2960840" d="4010">But it might be complicated like here&#39;s how you go after the dragon of Chaos</p>
<p t="2965640" d="4520">Right and so that&#39;s it sort of maps on to that hierarchy this thing</p>
<p t="2971100" d="2000">That we talked about in some detail</p>
<p t="2973470" d="1139">this</p>
<p t="2974609" d="5480">when you&#39;re telling a story to people when you&#39;re informing them about something you can talk to them at a very high level of</p>
<p t="2980250" d="2000">Resolution what you do with your child</p>
<p t="2982500" d="5060">Here&#39;s, how you slice up some broccoli right, but then you move up the obstruction</p>
<p t="2987560" d="2669">So here&#39;s how you act like a civilized person at the dinner table</p>
<p t="2990840" d="5209">Right and that&#39;s part of being a good person so you can tell stories about I just went and saw logan</p>
<p t="2996050" d="4559">I really like by the way, it&#39;s super violent, but I really did like it. It&#39;s</p>
<p t="3001430" d="3709">Got a very elegant mythological structure. Which is not surprising, but</p>
<p t="3005900" d="2030">There&#39;s a scene in this logan movie. He</p>
<p t="3008840" d="1140">It&#39;s not a spoiler</p>
<p t="3009980" d="6320">he has this child with him who has not been I was being raised Roughly in a laboratory and</p>
<p t="3016700" d="1760">She has absolutely no table Manners</p>
<p t="3018460" d="1990">and so they&#39;re sitting at</p>
<p t="3020450" d="5659">The dinner with some people that they run into and she&#39;s you know eating like a total barbarian and of course everybody&#39;s</p>
<p t="3026510" d="7340">Eyebrows are raised like where did this person come from so the fact that that high order behavior isn&#39;t there is</p>
<p t="3034310" d="4909">Something that&#39;s of extraordinary interest to everyone and so you know you teach your children</p>
<p t="3040190" d="6050">Microstrategy&#39;s, and you teach the macro strategies some of the macro strategies you&#39;re teaching them you don&#39;t even understand</p>
<p t="3046880" d="2690">Because you know you know the strategies. They&#39;re built into you</p>
<p t="3050119" d="5570">Because of an evolutionary process roughly speaking, and you say things like it doesn&#39;t matter whether you win</p>
<p t="3055690" d="1500">Or lose it matters you play the game</p>
<p t="3057190" d="3000">And you don&#39;t understand what that means although you know it&#39;s right</p>
<p t="3060190" d="6600">And you try to act that out for your children and they incorporate it in their action even though they can&#39;t represent it</p>
<p t="3066790" d="1870">They cannot come up with a fully</p>
<p t="3068660" d="1350">articulated</p>
<p t="3070010" d="3800">Representation of what that means and so they&#39;re like children piagetian children</p>
<p t="3074930" d="7640">Children can only play by themselves to begin with while they&#39;re integrating themselves internally then they start to play in parallel with other children</p>
<p t="3082570" d="7079">So you&#39;ll your - you play your game that child plays his or her game a little interaction, but you can&#39;t unite the games</p>
<p t="3090290" d="810">then you&#39;re</p>
<p t="3091100" d="5809">Between 2 &amp; 4 you start to be able to unite the games and you can either do that by acting them out you can</p>
<p t="3096910" d="3300">Do this even with the younger child they can catch Peekaboo very rapidly?</p>
<p t="3100640" d="3710">But once you&#39;re between 2 &amp; 4 and you start getting linguistic</p>
<p t="3104350" d="6270">You can start saying well, let&#39;s play this game, and that means we&#39;re going to unite our attention towards a particular goal</p>
<p t="3111170" d="7430">We&#39;re going to unite our motor activity and maybe cooperate and compete towards that goal the beginning of the social structure</p>
<p t="3118880" d="5630">The beginning of the social structure and you get really good at that between 2 &amp; 4 but you don&#39;t necessarily?</p>
<p t="3124730" d="6110">Know what you&#39;re doing, you can&#39;t say it so PJs experiments indicated that if you take children</p>
<p t="3131240" d="2689">Maybe they&#39;ve got to the point where they can play quite a social game</p>
<p t="3133930" d="4680">Maybe they&#39;re 5 or 6 they&#39;re playing marbles you take them out of the game and you say okay?</p>
<p t="3138610" d="3959">Tell me the rules of the game of marbles they give incoherent representations</p>
<p t="3142850" d="3829">Why because their behavior is more sophisticated than their?</p>
<p t="3147020" d="6320">Representation you see as soon as you understand that that is a wild thing to understand because it answers the question for example</p>
<p t="3154160" d="3380">How can you have dreams that tell you things you don&#39;t know?</p>
<p t="3158270" d="4040">You think well how the hell can that possibly be you&#39;re coming up with the damn dream?</p>
<p t="3162650" d="2630">How can the dream tell you things you don&#39;t know or?</p>
<p t="3165890" d="4940">analogously, how can people tell stories that contain information that they don&#39;t understand an</p>
<p t="3171440" d="5449">Answer is the information is coded in our behavior okay, so we&#39;ll go back to a chimpanzee troop</p>
<p t="3177680" d="7040">All the chimpanzees in the troop know the dominant Hierarchy structure, but if you take a chimpanzee out</p>
<p t="3185270" d="4669">From the troop and say what&#39;s the dominant structure the chimpanzee is going to?</p>
<p t="3190640" d="6650">Do whatever a chimpanzee does it&#39;s not going to have a little conversation with you about the nature of the dominant Hierarchy</p>
<p t="3197290" d="4709">So it can act out its knowledge, and it might even be able to represent it an image</p>
<p t="3203300" d="1920">but it can&#39;t</p>
<p t="3205220" d="1380">articulate it</p>
<p t="3206600" d="7729">well, why would we be any different we aren&#39;t obviously because we&#39;re more complex than we understand so the fact that we&#39;re more complex than</p>
<p t="3214330" d="5729">We understand means that we contain information that we cannot articulate. Why can&#39;t that reveal itself?</p>
<p t="3220060" d="2550">It does all the time you have a revelation</p>
<p t="3223610" d="7219">Aha, I get it. Well. What is that? It&#39;s maybe you&#39;re in psychotherapy, and we talk about some things about your past</p>
<p t="3230830" d="6750">We say well this happened then this hop and then this happened look there&#39;s a pattern wow and it&#39;s overwhelming. It&#39;s like now</p>
<p t="3237580" d="5760">There&#39;s a concordance between your knowledge and the things that you&#39;re acting out, and that&#39;s what comes as a revelation</p>
<p t="3243560" d="6500">So one of the things that happens in Exodus moses is leading his people through the desert classic u-shaped story</p>
<p t="3250060" d="4800">They&#39;re in eternity to begin with right, so that&#39;s the that&#39;s the insufficient present</p>
<p t="3254860" d="7019">That&#39;s the old order then they cross the water the destructive water. That&#39;s Chaos like the flood then they&#39;re out in the desert</p>
<p t="3262430" d="5900">Wandering without direction they start worshipping idols. They&#39;re wandering without direction and then</p>
<p t="3268970" d="2000">Moses goes up on the mountain</p>
<p t="3271850" d="2029">Which is by the way, what happens in Logan?</p>
<p t="3273880" d="4290">Just because if you&#39;re going to go see it, you might as well know that because it&#39;s a journey up a mountain</p>
<p t="3279530" d="6379">he goes up the mountain and he gets rules revealed to them well the way the story is structured is just ordinary interesting because</p>
<p t="3287150" d="5810">moses takes his people away from this peer net tyrannical structure, but they don&#39;t go from Tyranny to</p>
<p t="3293750" d="5810">Paradise to the promised land in one move that isn&#39;t how it works they have to they go from eternity to</p>
<p t="3299810" d="7339">Absolute Chaos where everyone is fighting and killing each other and having a terrible time of it in half starving and and having to pass</p>
<p t="3307370" d="3829">Through the red sea like it&#39;s they go from Tyranny to catastrophe</p>
<p t="3311630" d="5000">Before they go to higher order and moses doesn&#39;t even make it to the place of higher order</p>
<p t="3317240" d="1670">He dies before he gets there</p>
<p t="3318910" d="4320">so it&#39;s quite the catastrophe and the israelites are all confused when they&#39;re out in the desert because</p>
<p t="3323589" d="3750">Even though they were in a tyranny and they were slaves now. They&#39;re nowhere, and they don&#39;t know anything</p>
<p t="3327499" d="5479">It&#39;s not good and so a lot of them actually start thinking about how good the damn tyranny was</p>
<p t="3333529" d="5150">Compared to wandering around in the desert. Which is exactly what happened in the soviet union right in Russia now. There&#39;s huge</p>
<p t="3339739" d="2000">Nostalgia for the Stalinist, Era</p>
<p t="3341959" d="3950">So these stories. They&#39;re always true. They&#39;re always happening</p>
<p t="3346160" d="7129">So anyways what happens to moses is that the story is quite interesting so the israelites start to fight amongst themselves</p>
<p t="3353660" d="5750">which of course they do because there&#39;s no higher order authority and so then moses sits and</p>
<p t="3360019" d="1970">Judges the like literally like a judge</p>
<p t="3361989" d="5520">He sits for hours every day and the squabbling israelites come up, and say you know he did this to me</p>
<p t="3367509" d="4590">And oh you did this to me and and so then moses has to figure out who&#39;s right and who&#39;s wrong</p>
<p t="3372099" d="4709">And he&#39;s doing this for like hours and hours for days and days for weeks and weeks for months</p>
<p t="3377449" d="6470">It&#39;s like the origin of English common law it&#39;s exactly what happened with common law because in common law what happens is that?</p>
<p t="3384380" d="4040">you have all the rights there are if you to have a dispute you go before the</p>
<p t="3388549" d="3199">Judiciary you sort out the dispute that becomes the precedent now</p>
<p t="3391749" d="6540">That&#39;s part of the body of laws the body of laws is what you act out. That&#39;s why it&#39;s a body well</p>
<p t="3398289" d="5909">That&#39;s what moses does so he&#39;s sitting there making judgments very very finely tuned</p>
<p t="3404900" d="1490">discreet Moral judgments</p>
<p t="3406390" d="5399">You know how difficult that is when two people have a dispute to try to figure out how to mediate between that you don&#39;t know?</p>
<p t="3411789" d="1871">Who&#39;s lying who&#39;s telling the truth?</p>
<p t="3413660" d="4969">You don&#39;t know exactly what an acceptable solution would be like it&#39;s really ridiculously hard work</p>
<p t="3418880" d="7579">So he walks through this entire process of continual judicial intermediation then he goes up the mountain and what does he get?</p>
<p t="3426859" d="2000">tablet a rule well, why</p>
<p t="3429289" d="2630">Well he spent his ten thousand hours</p>
<p t="3433759" d="4429">Investigating the structure of morality in a practical way, and it goes bang</p>
<p t="3438679" d="3290">This is what we&#39;ve been doing these are the rules</p>
<p t="3442069" d="5629">It&#39;s not like there&#39;s no rules to begin with and those those are opposed because that wouldn&#39;t work</p>
<p t="3447829" d="7639">It doesn&#39;t work that way you have to take how people are extract out what the pattern of what they are is</p>
<p t="3455959" d="5750">Reflect that back to the well. That&#39;s that&#39;s the story of moses, and it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s a myth. It&#39;s a meta story</p>
<p t="3461900" d="2479">It&#39;s a story about how rules come to be</p>
<p t="3464900" d="3139">We act a certain way we have certain kinds of expectations</p>
<p t="3468040" d="4470">We have certain kinds of disputes out of that a pattern a pattern way of being</p>
<p t="3473060" d="4820">Emerges then we map the pattern way of being we say well look here&#39;s the rules. There&#39;s ten of them</p>
<p t="3478520" d="7130">Or however many you want to extract right? I mean, it&#39;s a moving target in some sense don&#39;t kill other people. That&#39;s a bad idea</p>
<p t="3486190" d="4290">Don&#39;t steal what other people have order your parents, ETc, Etc</p>
<p t="3490480" d="3839">I mean either you could come up with a different basic set of rules</p>
<p t="3494510" d="4699">But there&#39;d be some overlap and those aren&#39;t bad to begin with course there were far more rules than that</p>
<p t="3499210" d="2639">but those were the central ones and so then you might say</p>
<p t="3502670" d="6290">Hey, if you took all ten of those rules, and you try to extract out one rule from them</p>
<p t="3509840" d="5000">That would be at the top of the hierarchy what would that be and in western Culture the idea there?</p>
<p t="3514840" d="3750">Is that do you want others as you would have them do unto you is the rule that</p>
<p t="3518590" d="5459">it&#39;s the meta rule that guides all other rules sort of like the one ring in the in the lord of the rings and</p>
<p t="3524150" d="5389">so it&#39;s this consistent Pattern of abstraction of ethical Guidelines, so</p>
<p t="3530180" d="1590">okay, so</p>
<p t="3531770" d="3440">Well until that maps on - well. There&#39;s a there&#39;s a micro</p>
<p t="3535210" d="1540">There&#39;s a micro level</p>
<p t="3536750" d="5959">That you instruct people at and that then there&#39;s a more abstract level that you would struck them out</p>
<p t="3542710" d="4020">And then there&#39;s a more abstract level well. Maybe at that point you can&#39;t exactly</p>
<p t="3547370" d="7010">Directly instruct them remember in the pinocchio story Geppetto sits pinoke or the cricket Jiminy sits</p>
<p t="3554510" d="5989">Pinocchio down and tries to lecture to him about what the highest level of Moral virtue is he sounds like a complete</p>
<p t="3561560" d="3110">Fraud he sounds like a propaganda artist. He&#39;s a Soapbox</p>
<p t="3565250" d="1380">preacher and</p>
<p t="3566630" d="3860">Pinocchio doesn&#39;t understand them at all why has to be acted out?</p>
<p t="3571220" d="2449">now maybe as a parent you can be a model for</p>
<p t="3574220" d="4489">Emulation which is so you&#39;re a model for imitation what you say matters</p>
<p t="3578710" d="2609">But it doesn&#39;t say as much matter as much as what you do</p>
<p t="3581990" d="2779">Maybe it would if what you said and what you did were the same</p>
<p t="3585050" d="4160">that&#39;s the ideal situation like that&#39;s what you want to do if you&#39;re a parent if</p>
<p t="3589430" d="5189">you say one act differently your kids will torture you to death and their right to do it -</p>
<p t="3594779" d="4969">Because you&#39;re confused and confusing them makes them anxious and aggressive, and they will go after you</p>
<p t="3600329" d="4489">Consistency consistency consistency and if you can&#39;t provide it, you&#39;ll drive them crazy</p>
<p t="3605369" d="8000">So you want to bring your words and your actions into alignment right? And that&#39;s part of the development of wisdom so okay, so</p>
<p t="3614249" d="2000">back to the Brain</p>
<p t="3621089" d="2149">All right, so this is there it&#39;s the motor homunculus</p>
<p t="3623729" d="5240">So now what I want to tell you about that is you just just think about what this thing is like</p>
<p t="3628970" d="2000">It&#39;s taking the world apart</p>
<p t="3631529" d="2000">And it&#39;s talking about it</p>
<p t="3633660" d="5179">So that&#39;s what a human being is like and that to me that&#39;s kind of an image of the mythological hero</p>
<p t="3639630" d="5959">It&#39;s the thing that can speak Magic words and take the worlds apart take the world apart now in one of the stories</p>
<p t="3645589" d="990">I&#39;m going to tell you today</p>
<p t="3646579" d="6270">Which is the story of the anu Mulisch which is the oldest written story that we have it&#39;s a mesopotamian story</p>
<p t="3652849" d="5760">And it&#39;s from the same pool of stories that the creation account in Genesis was extracted</p>
<p t="3658609" d="6840">It isn&#39;t obvious what the temporal sequence was but imagine there was a pool of stories in the middle east that were of indefinite age</p>
<p t="3665849" d="7070">Tens of thousands of years and and each of them were developed in a slightly different way although the themes underneath were were similar</p>
<p t="3673019" d="6199">There are great parallels between the mesopotamian creation account and the first part of the creation account in Genesis</p>
<p t="3679380" d="2149">So it was discovered in the late</p>
<p t="3682380" d="3349">1900s and isis just destroyed a huge</p>
<p t="3686880" d="5449">Treasure trove of that sort of manuscripts, so just so you know so at Nineveh</p>
<p t="3692670" d="4040">so we can we can thank the war in the middle east for the destruction of</p>
<p t="3697259" d="3020">huge a huge treasure house of irreplaceable</p>
<p t="3700469" d="4880">Human knowledge and a lot of that&#39;s happening that&#39;s happening very very frequently it&#39;s an absolute bloody</p>
<p t="3706979" d="2330">disgraceful Catastrophe, so</p>
<p t="3710309" d="6890">Anyway, so you know that that&#39;s the human being lips tongues hands and the face your face is also extraordinarily</p>
<p t="3718619" d="1561">amenable to</p>
<p t="3720180" d="1020">Voluntary</p>
<p t="3721200" d="2149">manipulation so you can learn to move</p>
<p t="3723920" d="6530">Neurons in the tissue underneath your eyes that&#39;s how that&#39;s how high-resolution your face is and that&#39;s part because it&#39;s a broadcast</p>
<p t="3730790" d="4520">Screen, which is why people are always looking at it right? And that&#39;s why if you watch a movie</p>
<p t="3735310" d="4229">It&#39;s always concentrating on people&#39;s faces because they&#39;re just broadcasting what?</p>
<p t="3740240" d="2360">They&#39;re broadcasting their stories</p>
<p t="3743510" d="4760">Constantly and we&#39;re looking at their faces. What are you looking at? What are your eyes pointing at? What are you up to?</p>
<p t="3748270" d="4979">What&#39;s your emotional expression? What are you going to do next? What do you think about me? Where are you going? And you&#39;re?</p>
<p t="3753830" d="4250">Brought like you find someone who has had too much plastic surgery uncanny</p>
<p t="3758720" d="5000">Because their face is dead because you cannot tell what they&#39;re up to there. They&#39;ve got this is aam. Be like aspect</p>
<p t="3763720" d="4050">That&#39;s terrifying and people like that. Look people like that got killed</p>
<p t="3768440" d="5510">That&#39;s why we&#39;re not like that or they didn&#39;t make like you want to know what that other person is up to I told you?</p>
<p t="3773950" d="2100">Already that&#39;s how the whites of our eyes evolve right</p>
<p t="3776050" d="2000">I don&#39;t you remember that story?</p>
<p t="3778400" d="5750">gorillas don&#39;t have that distinction between the Iris and the white not like human beings and our eyes are very sharp and</p>
<p t="3784220" d="2000">One thing we really want to know is</p>
<p t="3786410" d="5150">What are you looking at? And why what are you up to? And if I can tell what you&#39;re looking at I can infer?</p>
<p t="3792500" d="5119">What you&#39;re going to do, and you want a broadcast dot well except when you don&#39;t want to broadcast it</p>
<p t="3797619" d="2400">But you know most of the time you want to be pretty</p>
<p t="3800210" d="5000">Transparent to other people because otherwise they won&#39;t trust you and if they don&#39;t trust you they won&#39;t cooperate with you</p>
<p t="3805359" d="4770">they won&#39;t compete with you and the probability that they&#39;ll come after you is extraordinarily high because you&#39;ll be</p>
<p t="3810890" d="2000">Evil predator in no time flat</p>
<p t="3813619" d="1351">so</p>
<p t="3814970" d="2000">okay, so</p>
<p t="3818810" d="3139">We&#39;ll take a look at the brain from another perspective</p>
<p t="3823760" d="3619">Now a lot of this I got from Alcone and Goldberg</p>
<p t="3829130" d="1460">Well, that&#39;s not exactly right</p>
<p t="3830590" d="5159">I had laid I laid this out before that but I found Alcone and Goldberg&#39;s writings afterwards</p>
<p t="3835750" d="2580">and he was a student of larious, and he was trying to account for</p>
<p t="3839210" d="7130">The why we had different hemispheres roughly speaking because it&#39;s not self-evident that we should they&#39;re actually somewhat two separate</p>
<p t="3846800" d="2000">consciousnesses and they</p>
<p t="3848960" d="4550">Communicate but the communication isn&#39;t complete. It&#39;s like our brain is modularized and</p>
<p t="3853910" d="5959">Unified at the same time and you can think about it like a me of people. Why do you want it mod your</p>
<p t="3860420" d="4429">Modularized well, so if one person goes down all of them. Don&#39;t that&#39;s one</p>
<p t="3865609" d="3110">One reason so it&#39;s some separation of function</p>
<p t="3869000" d="1770">Why else well?</p>
<p t="3870770" d="8000">each little module can do its own creative thing independently of the others and that&#39;s useful and then there can be communication between them and</p>
<p t="3879050" d="1049">so</p>
<p t="3880099" d="7040">There&#39;s there&#39;s utility and modularity and there&#39;s utility and integration and part of what we&#39;re trying to work out on the global political scene</p>
<p t="3887140" d="6630">right now is how modular things should be and how integrated they should be and the European community rushed into integration and</p>
<p t="3894619" d="6229">That&#39;s bothering people dreadfully because they feel that the advantages of modularization have been washed away</p>
<p t="3901240" d="3629">You saw that maybe they&#39;re right because you saw what happened with Greece collapsed</p>
<p t="3905510" d="6829">right and Greece is very very corrupt incredibly corrupt and germany whatever else you might think about Germany is not corrupt and</p>
<p t="3913040" d="7849">So the EEC tried to bring Greece and Germany together that didn&#39;t work there was no unity there the modularity was actually</p>
<p t="3920890" d="6479">Useful and the fact that Greece was so destabilized and Italy also very corrupt and spain also very corrupt</p>
<p t="3927890" d="6140">Was very shaky just about brought the whole thing down it the argument is the modularity would have been better</p>
<p t="3934670" d="5659">conserved well who knows right because modularity is useful and so is integration, but</p>
<p t="3940970" d="4609">Full integration seems to be a mistake and so does full modularity, how do you get that right?</p>
<p t="3945579" d="4140">We don&#39;t know that&#39;s why we&#39;re arguing about it and right now. There&#39;s a backlash.</p>
<p t="3949849" d="4700">We&#39;re pulling away from the integration and you you can see why - because in</p>
<p t="3954829" d="6080">2008 was the American economy collapsed the world economy just about collapsed that seems like a bad idea.</p>
<p t="3960910" d="4500">You know you might want some some separateness so that if one system</p>
<p t="3965900" d="3530">malfunctions and goes down the whole bloody thing doesn&#39;t go into flames and</p>
<p t="3969650" d="3679">So we don&#39;t know we don&#39;t know how to manage that it&#39;s a really really</p>
<p t="3974000" d="2089">complicated problem, so</p>
<p t="3977000" d="3679">Anyways ok so how does the how does the brain work? Well the left?</p>
<p t="3981500" d="5899">Roughly speaking in right handed mail and the reason that I&#39;m concentrating on Right-handed males is because</p>
<p t="3987589" d="5439">they&#39;re simpler in their neurological structure when have a more complicated neurological structure and</p>
<p t="3993519" d="3110">Left-Handed People tend to have a more complicated neurological structure</p>
<p t="3996729" d="7280">So we&#39;ll just say that we&#39;ll just go with the standard model to begin with and you can assume that the same systems are</p>
<p t="4004289" d="1400">there in every person</p>
<p t="4005689" d="6090">But they&#39;re not laid out on the hemispheric structure quite as neatly but they&#39;re still there so it&#39;s sort of like these are tendencies</p>
<p t="4012119" d="2119">so for example if you&#39;re a</p>
<p t="4014849" d="7339">so there&#39;s a tendency for the right hemisphere to specialize for what&#39;s relatively unknown and the left hemisphere to specialize for what&#39;s</p>
<p t="4022589" d="3020">Relatively mastered and you could think about it this way, too</p>
<p t="4028559" d="1591">left</p>
<p t="4030150" d="1740">right</p>
<p t="4031890" d="2569">it&#39;s something like that okay, so</p>
<p t="4035549" d="1740">large-scale Low-resolution</p>
<p t="4037289" d="2389">abstractions tend to be the province of the right high</p>
<p t="4039959" d="4880">Resolution Detailed knowledge structures tend to be the province of the left the left is linguistic</p>
<p t="4044839" d="3839">That&#39;s where the detailed structures manifest themselves in articulation</p>
<p t="4048679" d="4470">But the fundamental difference between the left and right isn&#39;t language versus</p>
<p t="4054209" d="2570">non language the fundamental distinction is</p>
<p t="4057929" d="4340">Relatively explored and mastered versus relatively unexplored and not mastered</p>
<p t="4062269" d="5489">And that&#39;s both in terms of structure the right hemisphere has a less granular structure. It&#39;s less differentiated</p>
<p t="4068249" d="6739">It&#39;s also responsible mostly for negative emotion especially in the prefrontal part and the reason for that is well. How do you encounter?</p>
<p t="4074989" d="2000">What&#39;s absolutely unknown?</p>
<p t="4078059" d="6139">Imagination and emotion right I told you that little experiment that you could do if you&#39;re alone in a house</p>
<p t="4084199" d="2000">And you hear a strange noise at night?</p>
<p t="4086309" d="1200">in A room</p>
<p t="4087509" d="5000">Turn off the lights and put your hand in the room like your brain will just flash off monsters like mad</p>
<p t="4092509" d="1570">You know you&#39;ll be nervous</p>
<p t="4094079" d="6229">Because that what&#39;s in that room something to make you nervous. That&#39;s a very low resolution category, right?</p>
<p t="4100309" d="2790">It&#39;s like it&#39;s a it&#39;s some</p>
<p t="4103799" d="1141">indeterminate</p>
<p t="4104940" d="5449">Manifestation of the Category of things that might hurt you very low resolution, but a very smart category</p>
<p t="4110389" d="4680">It&#39;s like don&#39;t put your hand in there you put your hand in there, and you watch your imagination. It&#39;s like monsters</p>
<p t="4115069" d="3870">It&#39;ll generate monsters like mat and that&#39;s what the right hemisphere is doing it&#39;s saying</p>
<p t="4119609" d="3080">What&#39;s in there is an exemplar of the category of things that are dangerous?</p>
<p t="4122699" d="5780">Here&#39;s a bunch of images of those things and that thing in there is going to partake of that essence</p>
<p t="4128480" d="2000">That&#39;s and that&#39;s a very low resolution</p>
<p t="4131280" d="6229">Hypothesis that&#39;s kind of what horror movies do with people you know they sort of lead them through that initial process and so</p>
<p t="4138060" d="4100">and so that&#39;s what the right the right hemisphere seems to me to be dominated by</p>
<p t="4142920" d="6829">Dominated by subcortical processes or the left hemisphere is reversed the Cortex is more or less got dominion and so</p>
<p t="4150000" d="5240">The right hemisphere well we&#39;ll walk through this neurologically, but the right hemisphere is</p>
<p t="4155760" d="6290">Responds Rapidly to what&#39;s unknown, and that&#39;s that subcortical the hippocampus is doing an awful lot of that</p>
<p t="4162630" d="6409">noting a Mismatch, and then it&#39;s using the right hemisphere to to abstractly represent what the</p>
<p t="4169590" d="1950">possibility space is</p>
<p t="4171540" d="5720">In relationship to unexpected things and then the right hemisphere is tracking that</p>
<p t="4177510" d="2839">Continually what those unexpected things are and coming up with</p>
<p t="4181020" d="2390">models of what you haven&#39;t yet, Mastered and</p>
<p t="4183960" d="4010">That&#39;s kept separate from the left hemisphere which already has functional models</p>
<p t="4187970" d="5549">And you don&#39;t want to blast the left hemisphere continually with anomalous information because you blow out its structure</p>
<p t="4193520" d="3810">And then you don&#39;t know what to do so the right hemisphere generates</p>
<p t="4198720" d="4910">New models in some sense out of nothing and then when the time is right taps</p>
<p t="4203940" d="3859">Information into the left hemisphere slowly so that it doesn&#39;t disrupt its function too much</p>
<p t="4207800" d="4679">And that&#39;s a lot of that seems to happen when you&#39;re dreaming by the way it happens at night</p>
<p t="4213000" d="5900">So and what happens with the dreams you think about how dreams work you might think of dreams as part of that process where?</p>
<p t="4219240" d="5750">ideas come to be so they&#39;re low resolution to begin with mostly a majestic really highly emotional and</p>
<p t="4225510" d="1650">Incoherent</p>
<p t="4227160" d="2000">less Coherent, why</p>
<p t="4229980" d="2030">You can&#39;t be coherent unless you know what to do</p>
<p t="4233640" d="3890">Abcdef if that&#39;s working you&#39;ve got coherent, but if you&#39;re dealing with something</p>
<p t="4237530" d="3029">You don&#39;t know you have to muck about with your category structures</p>
<p t="4240560" d="6180">And that&#39;s what dreams do and you know when you&#39;re interpreting a dream one of the things you watch for is the dream</p>
<p t="4246930" d="5120">the dream presents this and then this that&#39;s called metonymy by the way from a literary perspective and</p>
<p t="4252180" d="5270">What that implies is this is related to this in some way why else would they be co activated?</p>
<p t="4257790" d="7459">You know people say well dreams are random. That&#39;s the stupidest theory I&#39;ve ever heard like white noise is random dreams are not random</p>
<p t="4265400" d="5580">They&#39;re hard to understand, but they&#39;re anything but random. They&#39;re more random than real-life</p>
<p t="4271310" d="3299">Well, that&#39;s because what you don&#39;t understand is really random</p>
<p t="4274610" d="730">and</p>
<p t="4275340" d="3649">You&#39;re organized and there has to be an intermediary that sort of quasi</p>
<p t="4279060" d="3049">random between them or you never get from one to the other and</p>
<p t="4282390" d="4639">Dreams and fantasies myths all of that is part of that process that</p>
<p t="4287280" d="3979">That stretches you out beyond what you know into the absolute unknown and so</p>
<p t="4294540" d="5000">And your hemispheres are differentially specialized for that, so roughly speaking</p>
<p t="4301080" d="2000">right hemisphere</p>
<p t="4303900" d="3439">Operation and unexplored territory. That&#39;s a really good way of thinking about it</p>
<p t="4307380" d="3290">you need a system that tells you what to do when you don&#39;t know what to do a</p>
<p t="4310830" d="2600">huge part of the subcortical structure is doing that too</p>
<p t="4313980" d="2180">unknown freeze then what</p>
<p t="4316800" d="3470">Imagine right freeze emotions imagine</p>
<p t="4320699" d="3470">Then explore then differentiate then Master</p>
<p t="4324360" d="7669">That&#39;s the process that&#39;s the process of learning and what you&#39;re doing is you&#39;re you&#39;re transforming low resolution representations of what&#39;s frightening</p>
<p t="4332640" d="2359">into high resolution representations that</p>
<p t="4335400" d="5299">Enable you to master it to take the world apart and to make ingenious things out of it</p>
<p t="4340699" d="6450">So there&#39;s this very cool part of the mesopotamian creation myth. So that the major hero whose name is Marduk</p>
<p t="4347670" d="3919">Confronts the dragon of Chaos Tiamat whose feminine and he cuts her into pieces</p>
<p t="4351960" d="5600">And he makes the world out of her pieces and one of his name&#39;s there&#39;s he had 50 60 names</p>
<p t="4357560" d="3209">and I think that was those were amalgams of tribal gods and</p>
<p t="4361830" d="4790">one of the names was he who makes ingenious things out of the conflict with Tiamat</p>
<p t="4367530" d="6229">Absolutely perfect because that&#39;s exactly what human beings do right we confront that terrible predatory</p>
<p t="4374850" d="5029">Potential that lies outside our domain of experience, and we make ingenious things out of it</p>
<p t="4379880" d="2970">And then we talk about how we did it and then we model</p>
<p t="4382850" d="5009">How we did it and that&#39;s the basis of our ethics and our morality and the way that that ties in to think about</p>
<p t="4388050" d="3080">one of the things we talked about was that the mythological hero was a</p>
<p t="4391560" d="3740">Representation not of the being that was at the top of the dominance hierarchy</p>
<p t="4395460" d="5840">But of the being that was at the top of the set of all possible dominance hierarchies okay, so here&#39;s a cool equation</p>
<p t="4401910" d="2089">the Hero who goes out into the unknown to</p>
<p t="4404700" d="7279">make contact with the dragon and to bring back the treasure is the same thing that wins the battle across sets of dominance hierarchies and</p>
<p t="4412110" d="3619">That&#39;s how the two things come together right? It&#39;s so brilliant</p>
<p t="4415730" d="5550">it&#39;s so absolutely brilliant and so it&#39;s the mythological hero the mythological Hero is the</p>
<p t="4421920" d="5390">Representation of what&#39;s again not at the top of one dominance hierarchy, but at the top of all of them. That&#39;s the eye</p>
<p t="4427310" d="7379">That&#39;s above the pyramid why the eye because it pays attention, and that&#39;s what you do none of this is this is not</p>
<p t="4435420" d="1140">fiction</p>
<p t="4436560" d="3290">It&#39;s meta truth. It&#39;s the right way to think about it look</p>
<p t="4440910" d="4609">Let&#39;s say you&#39;re socially anxious okay? So what happens when you&#39;re socially anxious?</p>
<p t="4447600" d="4220">You go to a party your heart&#39;s beating. Why the party is a monster</p>
<p t="4451980" d="3290">Why because it&#39;s judging you and it&#39;s judging you?</p>
<p t="4455270" d="6149">It&#39;s putting you low down the dominance hierarchy because that&#39;s what a negative judgement is and that interferes with your sexual</p>
<p t="4461970" d="5089">success and that means that you&#39;re being harshly evaluated by Nature itself</p>
<p t="4467490" d="5899">Right so you are confronting that the dragon of Chaos when you go into the social situation and so</p>
<p t="4473390" d="6089">What do you do? You like this like you hunched over and that&#39;s low dominance. I&#39;m no threat. It&#39;s like well</p>
<p t="4479480" d="1300">That&#39;s not going to get you very far</p>
<p t="4480780" d="5569">You know, but that&#39;s a logical thing to do in the in the face of a tyrant so I&#39;m no threat</p>
<p t="4486350" d="5970">You know you look at the king, and you&#39;re dead I&#39;m no threat. I&#39;m hunched over and then what&#39;s happening internally</p>
<p t="4492390" d="1790">How are what are people thinking about me?</p>
<p t="4494180" d="5339">What are people thinking about me or am I looking stupid am I looking foolish jeez I&#39;m awkward. I hate being here man</p>
<p t="4499520" d="2000">I&#39;m sweating too much, it&#39;s all</p>
<p t="4501900" d="7940">Internalized right, it&#39;s all self focused the the eye isn&#39;t worked the eye isn&#39;t working. What do you tell people?</p>
<p t="4510690" d="6470">Stop don&#39;t stop thinking about yourself because you can&#39;t it&#39;s like don&#39;t think of a white elephant</p>
<p t="4517650" d="5660">White elephant white elephant white elephant you can&#39;t tell someone to stop thinking about something because they get caught in a loop</p>
<p t="4523410" d="4669">What you do with socially anxious people is you say look at other people</p>
<p t="4528600" d="6290">Look at them right why because if you look at them, you can tell what they&#39;re thinking and then you</p>
<p t="4535170" d="5210">Unless you&#39;re unless you&#39;re terribly socialized and some people are some people have no social skills</p>
<p t="4540380" d="4649">and so the reason they can&#39;t go to a party is because they don&#39;t even know how to introduce themselves like they&#39;re just</p>
<p t="4545100" d="3620">No one ever taught them how to behave and so they&#39;re really good</p>
<p t="4550560" d="4370">Candidates for Behavior therapy because you walk them through the process of how you actually</p>
<p t="4556440" d="5180">Manifest the procedures that are associated with social acceptability, but most people aren&#39;t like that</p>
<p t="4561620" d="6270">They have the ability so if they&#39;re really introverted and high in neuroticism. They can usually talk quite well to someone one-on-one</p>
<p t="4568410" d="3560">Why because they look at them well if I look at you?</p>
<p t="4571970" d="5310">It&#39;s another thing to do if you&#39;re ever speaking to a group of people never speak to the group of people</p>
<p t="4577560" d="2180">that doesn&#39;t exist you talk to</p>
<p t="4580470" d="6649">Individuals and then they reflect for you the entire group because they&#39;re all entrained. If you look at one person</p>
<p t="4587520" d="5180">They&#39;ve broadcast to you what everyone&#39;s thinking and you know how to talk to one person, so it&#39;s easy</p>
<p t="4593370" d="7819">So as soon as you focus on the person (not you) you push your attention outward use your eye push your attention Outward</p>
<p t="4601190" d="1680">And you start watching well</p>
<p t="4602870" d="6120">Then all your automatic mechanisms kick in and you stop being awkward because if we&#39;re talking, and I&#39;m looking here I</p>
<p t="4609960" d="3020">don&#39;t know what you&#39;re going to do next and I&#39;m going to put</p>
<p t="4613500" d="8000">Disjunctions into the like they&#39;re like bad chords in the melody of our of our conversation because the reason is I&#39;m not paying attention</p>
<p t="4622230" d="3350">So that&#39;s why the eye is the thing at the top of the pyramid it&#39;s like</p>
<p t="4625680" d="5270">The thing that enables you to win the set of all possible dominance hierarchies is the eye. Pay attention.</p>
<p t="4631470" d="1170">Pay attention.</p>
<p t="4632640" d="3830">That&#39;s the critical issue. That&#39;s why the Egyptians worshiped Horus</p>
<p t="4636680" d="5729">That&#39;s why Horus was the thing that rescued Osiris from the from the depths. It&#39;s the capacity to pay attention</p>
<p t="4642510" d="2000">What do you pay attention to most?</p>
<p t="4645330" d="7370">What your right hemisphere signals as anomalous. It attracts your attention it&#39;s like this isn&#39;t going quite right? I&#39;m not looking at that.</p>
<p t="4653310" d="2000">Wrong!</p>
<p t="4655350" d="5329">That&#39;s what you look at. That&#39;s what you look at. What not going right because that&#39;s see</p>
<p t="4660679" d="4680">that&#39;s the terrible monster that might eat you but it&#39;s also the place you get all the information, so</p>
<p t="4666630" d="2389">That&#39;s why it&#39;s useful to have discussions with your enemies</p>
<p t="4669840" d="5899">Because they will tell you things you do not know and that&#39;s such a great thing because if you don&#39;t know them well</p>
<p t="4675739" d="3629">You&#39;re not very smart are you you know there may be a time when you go somewhere.</p>
<p t="4679469" d="4549">That&#39;s the thing you need to know and maybe your enemy will tell you why you&#39;re such a fool</p>
<p t="4684209" d="2450">You know and a bunch of other things that aren&#39;t true, too</p>
<p t="4687300" d="5149">But even one thing that&#39;s accurate it&#39;s like yeah, thanks very much man. Maybe I&#39;ll do some work on that</p>
<p t="4692449" d="6299">I won&#39;t have to carry that forward so and that&#39;s part of the reason again. Why the terrible predator,</p>
<p t="4698749" d="5399">It&#39;s always the terrible predator that has the gold it&#39;s like the person who delivers the message you do not want to hear</p>
<p t="4704429" d="2000">So it&#39;s rough, it&#39;s rough</p>
<p t="4706530" d="2389">But it doesn&#39;t matter who life is rough</p>
<p t="4709439" d="1560">okay, so</p>
<p t="4710999" d="1500">How are these</p>
<p t="4712499" d="2000">specialized?</p>
<p t="4715079" d="4700">The right hemisphere operation and unexplored territory and that unexplored territory</p>
<p t="4720570" d="7189">Emerges when ever what you&#39;re doing doesn&#39;t work you know you can conceptualize it as that which is Beyond the walls of the city</p>
<p t="4728399" d="2000">But the City is a category structure</p>
<p t="4730889" d="1621">abstractly...</p>
<p t="4732510" d="2000">abstractly put.</p>
<p t="4734969" d="7669">There&#39;s no difference between the barbarians that invade the walled city and the things that happen in the world that damage your category structure</p>
<p t="4742769" d="2840">They&#39;re, they&#39;re the same thing from up from a practical perspective</p>
<p t="4750959" d="6170">Okay, right hemisphere operation and unexplored territory negative emotion inhibition of Behavior</p>
<p t="4757380" d="5569">That&#39;s this that&#39;s anxiety that&#39;s what happens when the Medusa looks at you you turn the stone, right?</p>
<p t="4762949" d="7199">That&#39;s the basilisk in Harry Potter. It freezes you why you&#39;re moving forward according to a schema. If you&#39;re moving</p>
<p t="4770639" d="3649">forward properly you&#39;re getting to where you want to go and the schema is being validated.</p>
<p t="4774959" d="5780">Simultaneously, I&#39;m moving for it and the map is correct something happens that&#39;s unexpected. What should you do?</p>
<p t="4781739" d="1320">Stop.</p>
<p t="4783059" d="4790">What else you going to do? You stop first then the predator can&#39;t see you, right?</p>
<p t="4787849" d="2189">That&#39;s the freezing reaction of a prey animal</p>
<p t="4790439" d="5210">So it&#39;s it&#39;s it built very very deeply into very very old circuits</p>
<p t="4795650" d="4439">do that. Fact if it&#39;s a real orienting reflex to something that&#39;s a anomalous you&#39;ll go like this</p>
<p t="4800150" d="5639">And that&#39;s to stop the thing that will jump on your back from carrying out your throat, and that&#39;s really really fast</p>
<p t="4806000" d="2429">It&#39;s almost as fast as spinal sneak</p>
<p t="4808950" d="7189">Reflex circuitry extraordinarily fast and but you know that&#39;s conserved over an evolutionary span that predator</p>
<p t="4816720" d="5359">Defense system is at the bottom of your cognitive apparatus everything be built on that like</p>
<p t="4824760" d="2000">it&#39;s a low-resolution pattern a</p>
<p t="4827220" d="4910">Higher-resolution pattern that&#39;s the same pattern is built on top of that. Then a higher-resolution</p>
<p t="4832380" d="5449">pattern that&#39;s the same pattern is built on top of that so on. But that initial architecture is</p>
<p t="4838710" d="3739">duplicated across the levels of differentiation of the nervous system</p>
<p t="4842450" d="5339">That&#39;s partly why these symbols can be so archaic and still be accurate it&#39;s still the way the world works.</p>
<p t="4848640" d="6470">Negative emotion inhibition of behavior image processing right because image thing about images is they&#39;re fast</p>
<p t="4855810" d="4250">You know a picture is worth a thousand words. Okay, you get the picture</p>
<p t="4860220" d="4729">You know get the picture is actually something you say to someone if you say; Do you understand?</p>
<p t="4865380" d="4429">Right if you get the picture is very very fast so the right hemisphere manages that</p>
<p t="4870540" d="4190">Holistic thinking that&#39;s that low resolution thinking that generalizes across instances.</p>
<p t="4874980" d="3919">Pattern recognition, pattern generation, and gross motor action. yeah.</p>
<p t="4879510" d="6290">Freeze and get the hell out of there that&#39;s gross motor action right hemispheres very good at that. That&#39;s why if you&#39;re</p>
<p t="4886620" d="1140">Right-Handed</p>
<p t="4887760" d="7520">User if you&#39;re right-handed you use your left hemisphere to manage the really fine motor details</p>
<p t="4895280" d="4080">Right you write with it you write with it and because that&#39;s very very</p>
<p t="4901680" d="4310">If you&#39;re right-handed you tend to use your left hand to open the top of jars</p>
<p t="4906870" d="2810">Right you&#39;re use your left hand. That&#39;s a gross motor action</p>
<p t="4909710" d="6419">I mean sometimes people are more lateralized than that, but the left hemisphere is specialized for the fine-grain things that you know very well</p>
<p t="4916130" d="7649">That&#39;s that&#39;s exactly it. Okay the left hemisphere while the left hemisphere which is associated with positive emotion by the way</p>
<p t="4924300" d="1340">that&#39;s</p>
<p t="4925640" d="1950">specialized for operation in explored territory.</p>
<p t="4927590" d="4469">So now what we might say is that you spend your whole life try not to have your right hemisphere turn on</p>
<p t="4933570" d="7009">Because why would you want that that&#39;s where the monsters pop up. So you stay in explored territory, but maybe you also</p>
<p t="4941280" d="6350">tentatively expand its borders and the left hemisphere seems to be involved in that too. So if you&#39;re curious about something</p>
<p t="4947630" d="2000">It&#39;s usually something usually</p>
<p t="4950460" d="2150">Something minor enough so that it won&#39;t blow your entire</p>
<p t="4952890" d="7220">Category structure if you explore it now sometimes you get unlucky and you&#39;re like Eve in the garden of Eden. You go have a little</p>
<p t="4960240" d="2689">chat with this little snake that seems to be</p>
<p t="4963660" d="2989">of no significance whatsoever and it feeds you something</p>
<p t="4967230" d="2240">the apple, it feeds you something and bang</p>
<p t="4970080" d="5750">Everything falls apart. Right. You collapse and you&#39;re out there in history. You&#39;re no longer in your old paradise</p>
<p t="4976410" d="2000">so</p>
<p t="4978720" d="2000">activation of behavior yeah, well that&#39;s because</p>
<p t="4981180" d="5719">Positive emotion is associated with movement forward like if you&#39;re where you want to be and things are going well</p>
<p t="4987480" d="4070">then your behavior should be activated so that you go and get things now one of the</p>
<p t="4991950" d="5719">Negative consequences of that is that if you&#39;re really in a good mood really happy you&#39;re going to be impulsive and make mistakes</p>
<p t="4998100" d="2000">You know because you hear these doe headed</p>
<p t="5000890" d="1920">That&#39;s a very minor word</p>
<p t="5002810" d="6350">People who are always pushing happiness as the as the key measure for for successful existence. It&#39;s so</p>
<p t="5011450" d="3859">Ill informed that it&#39;s embarrassing that that even happens</p>
<p t="5016040" d="5750">Positive emotion makes people impulsive. Maniacs for example. Which is really if you that&#39;s mania, right?</p>
<p t="5022340" d="3079">Bipolar disorder if you&#39;re manic you&#39;re one happy person</p>
<p t="5026120" d="3350">Way to happy everything is great nothing</p>
<p t="5029470" d="4410">But wonderful things that are beyond your imagination are going to happen to you</p>
<p t="5033880" d="3839">And they&#39;re going to happen fast and so you&#39;re down to the mall to buy everything</p>
<p t="5037790" d="5000">You can possibly get your hands on because you have a hundred uses for everything and then a week later</p>
<p t="5042890" d="2450">You know you crash into your depressive</p>
<p t="5046160" d="3709">Episode and you realize that you&#39;re 150 thousand dollars in debt</p>
<p t="5049870" d="5910">And you&#39;ve alienated everyone that you know it&#39;s like that&#39;s untrammeled positive emotion. So how about no. a</p>
<p t="5058130" d="6200">peer index of positive emotion is no way of determining whether or not a system is working properly even your own system</p>
<p t="5064330" d="6209">You need a balance between positive and negative emotions plus positive emotions are absolutely exhausting</p>
<p t="5071030" d="5150">Because if you&#39;re in a manic episode, it&#39;s like, it&#39;s time to get everything good right now fine</p>
<p t="5076180" d="5790">But you won&#39;t sleep for a week, and then you die because you just burned yourself to a crisp and so to be</p>
<p t="5083240" d="1200">overwhelmingly</p>
<p t="5084440" d="4819">Enthusiastic about everything sounds like a real blast and I&#39;ve seen full-blown manic, so they&#39;re having plenty of fun</p>
<p t="5089260" d="4860">But it is not a pleasant thing to behold. They&#39;re just all over the place and</p>
<p t="5094850" d="1350">ya know</p>
<p t="5096200" d="7219">Yeah, it&#39;s really not to it. It&#39;s really not good, it&#39;s really not good you need a balance between these two systems because the whole world isn&#39;t</p>
<p t="5104210" d="4580">Explored territory bursting with nothing but promise that&#39;s not the world.</p>
<p t="5109250" d="6529">The world is that in the bounded space a little bit with that absolute horror show going out</p>
<p t="5116120" d="6169">around the periphery and both of your both systems need to be active in order to keep you balanced</p>
<p t="5123020" d="1830">people do unfortunately</p>
<p t="5124850" d="2899">sustained damage sometimes to the left Prefrontal Cortex</p>
<p t="5128300" d="3260">responsible for positive emotion or the right Prefrontal Cortex</p>
<p t="5131840" d="4280">responsible for negative emotion and if you sustained right hemisphere prefrontal damage</p>
<p t="5136120" d="3509">It makes you inappropriately happy and impulsive and you and your life</p>
<p t="5139630" d="5129">Just goes you just spiral Downhill because you make nothing but impulsive decisions</p>
<p t="5144760" d="3150">And you know what the real world consequence of that is you know?</p>
<p t="5148940" d="2180">Get drunk and be impulsive for one night</p>
<p t="5151120" d="4409">You can learn what the bloody consequences of that are you try living like that for a month?</p>
<p t="5156170" d="5120">Independently of IQ that&#39;s the other thing that&#39;s so interesting you can blow out your left prefrontal</p>
<p t="5161510" d="3890">Cortex and not suffer much of a decrease especially in crystallized intelligence</p>
<p t="5165980" d="2149">but the fact that you&#39;re running on nothing but</p>
<p t="5168680" d="6079">Sorry, you&#39;re right hemisphere you&#39;re running on nothing, but positive emotion. It&#39;s going to order you right into the ground and then if you&#39;re</p>
<p t="5175490" d="3649">Perhaps even more unlucky and you lose the left prefrontal</p>
<p t="5180170" d="2419">Cortex, then you&#39;re permanently depressed</p>
<p t="5183380" d="2000">because there&#39;s nothing but</p>
<p t="5187160" d="1770">the unexplored</p>
<p t="5188930" d="3379">manifesting itself we know that if you take depressive depressed people and you</p>
<p t="5193099" d="2880">Do EEG analysis that they have predominant lefting</p>
<p t="5196739" d="4790">predominant resting right hemisphere EEG activation and so</p>
<p t="5202920" d="2779">So that&#39;s roughly. So why is this? Well,</p>
<p t="5206280" d="5030">unknown territory known territory you think well is that real? Well, It&#39;s real enough</p>
<p t="5211310" d="2849">So that&#39;s how your brain evolved that seems pretty damn real</p>
<p t="5214409" d="3919">So then we could think about it subcortically and we might as well do that</p>
<p t="5219989" d="5870">This is mapped out on the hippocampus more most particularly by Jeffrey Gray who is influenced by?</p>
<p t="5226500" d="2149">Sokolov and vinegared Ova</p>
<p t="5228650" d="6509">who are also students of Luria. Jeffrey Gray used cybernetic theory that was developed by Norbert Wiener and</p>
<p t="5235739" d="1920">which is an AI</p>
<p t="5237659" d="2870">which he is the father of artificial intelligence and</p>
<p t="5241349" d="1951">Some of that was actually</p>
<p t="5243300" d="4910">integrated as well in to Piagetian thought because Piaget and Wiener, Er Norbert Wiener and</p>
<p t="5248760" d="4879">Luria if I remember correctly all went to the same conference back in the early 1920s</p>
<p t="5254130" d="5870">Mid 1920s and heard Norbert Wiener speak so that&#39;s how cybernetics theory got built into some of these underlying</p>
<p t="5261060" d="3109">Theories and sort of manifested itself everywhere so Gray</p>
<p t="5264659" d="4610">Gray uses a model very much like this derived from cybernetic theory and so here&#39;s the idea</p>
<p t="5269270" d="2759">How does the brain work you have a target in mind?</p>
<p t="5273599" d="2000">and you act to</p>
<p t="5275760" d="3890">to manifest the target you act to transform the world into the target and</p>
<p t="5279869" d="5630">Then you compare the consequence of your actions to the target and if they matched and that&#39;s a good thing and if they don&#39;t match</p>
<p t="5285500" d="2549">Then that&#39;s what where negative emotion comes from. Okay,</p>
<p t="5288050" d="6899">So how does that work the hippocampus seems to be central to that, so it detects Mismatch so so in the classic</p>
<p t="5295469" d="6649">Behavioral theory, so this would be Gray&#39;s theory you have your expectations of the world that would be your model</p>
<p t="5302119" d="6510">And you have your sensory input which is the real world and then the hippocampus is mapping one on to the other</p>
<p t="5309210" d="5719">One from a top-down stream one from the bottom up stream and saying Match Match Match match</p>
<p t="5315119" d="6530">And as long as everything matches then the hippocampus (this is an oversimplification) keeps the subcortical</p>
<p t="5322230" d="4279">emotional systems inhibited because you don&#39;t need them except for maybe mi</p>
<p t="5327020" d="3359">mild positive emotion to keep you moving forward if there&#39;s a mismatch</p>
<p t="5331620" d="2569">That&#39;s anxiety the anxiety system gets</p>
<p t="5334500" d="4879">Disinhibited because it&#39;s so on it doesn&#39;t get activated gets disinhibited that freezes you and all the other</p>
<p t="5339510" d="4489">motivational systems are primed because God only knows what you&#39;re going to have to do next okay, so</p>
<p t="5344580" d="1500">then if</p>
<p t="5346080" d="1230">You make a mistake</p>
<p t="5347310" d="6350">Given that scheme you have to modify the world in order to rectify the mistake you have to modify your motor output so that you</p>
<p t="5353660" d="3299">Put the world back in order, and that&#39;s basically Gray&#39;s model</p>
<p t="5357300" d="5479">But Gray&#39;s model is insufficient because Gray presumes that what you&#39;re comparing</p>
<p t="5363480" d="3229">Your expectation with is the real world</p>
<p t="5368220" d="5569">but you don&#39;t have access to the real world what really happens is that your brain compares the model of</p>
<p t="5374400" d="810">the World</p>
<p t="5375210" d="6530">That you want to have happen so it&#39;s desired and not expected with the model of the world that you think is happening</p>
<p t="5381810" d="1490">They&#39;re both models</p>
<p t="5383300" d="2550">There&#39;s no direct contact with the truth</p>
<p t="5385850" d="5969">And so what that means and this is what&#39;s horrible about this is that if your model fails..</p>
<p t="5391820" d="2220">it doesn&#39;t only mean that you have to adjust</p>
<p t="5394530" d="4970">your expectation and change your motor activity it means you might have to bloody well retool your</p>
<p t="5400140" d="6049">perceptions. Well that&#39;s a lot more horrifying than just having to change your motor output if you betray me</p>
<p t="5406800" d="5630">Then I have to see you differently, and you know if we&#39;ve interacted a long time</p>
<p t="5412430" d="2489">I&#39;ve built up a hell of a model of you</p>
<p t="5414920" d="2490">You know it&#39;s taken a tremendous amount of effort to generate</p>
<p t="5417410" d="4770">And I may have used that model as a predicate for all sorts of other plans</p>
<p t="5422180" d="6869">Which is what you do with an intimate relationship, and so then if you do something that indicates a true mismatch</p>
<p t="5429090" d="2780">It isn&#39;t only that I have to adjust my actions</p>
<p t="5432510" d="4969">God only knows what I&#39;m going to have to retool. I may even have to retool my perceptions of myself</p>
<p t="5437610" d="2660">I&#39;m a lot more gullible than I thought I was for example</p>
<p t="5440280" d="6170">And God only knows what the implications of that are if you&#39;re close to me, and you could do this to me</p>
<p t="5447750" d="7100">Is that my flaw and environment am I carrying that into other relationships? It&#39;s an absolute catastrophe, and so Gray actually</p>
<p t="5455460" d="6079">underestimated the degree of severity of Mismatch because he only said well it was motor output and and</p>
<p t="5462359" d="2630">re re-world adjusting that would have to be</p>
<p t="5465209" d="5330">Repaired not perception because like most behavior see the behaviorist had this idea of stimulus, right?</p>
<p t="5470879" d="3290">The stimulus produces the response it&#39;s like okay</p>
<p t="5474839" d="2330">What stimulus well they never went there?</p>
<p t="5477239" d="2540">They just assumed that the stimulus spoke for itself</p>
<p t="5480119" d="3290">But it doesn&#39;t that&#39;s the fundamental weakness of behavioral</p>
<p t="5483689" d="3530">Theory is that the reason they could get rid of the mind was because they hid it</p>
<p t="5487679" d="4699">Invisibly inside the idea of the stimulus which is all of a sudden not just something that was a sense</p>
<p t="5493050" d="4609">Like a piece of sense data, but that had motivations built into it well no.</p>
<p t="5498269" d="2780">No. You can&#39;t do that. The</p>
<p t="5501570" d="5029">Motivation you can put the motivation in the object, but then it&#39;s no longer an object. It&#39;s something completely different</p>
<p t="5509579" d="2479">Ok good. Let&#39;s stop there when you come back</p>
<p t="5512059" d="3569">I&#39;m going to tell you a bunch of stories ok so it will break for 15 minutes</p>
<p t="5517469" d="7040">so imagine what happens when a civilization develops and it develops out of an amalgam of tribal organizations and</p>
<p t="5525539" d="2419">so each of those tribes has their own god</p>
<p t="5527959" d="5939">which is their own sort of imaginative universe and their attempt to make sense out of the Moral landscape of being and</p>
<p t="5535050" d="2000">underneath all of those</p>
<p t="5537239" d="5629">representations is a pattern and the reason there&#39;s a pattern there is because all of those tribes are made up of people and</p>
<p t="5543089" d="6650">so there&#39;s going to be it&#39;s like there&#39;s a domain within which variation is going to occur so if we&#39;re going to set up a</p>
<p t="5550379" d="3950">Structure that works across time it&#39;s going to at least be roughly</p>
<p t="5554609" d="4520">Predicated on the same structures that a dominance hierarchy is predicated on it&#39;s going to be</p>
<p t="5559349" d="6140">Predicated on the same patterns of interactions that would characterize a chimpanzee troop you know. There&#39;s this basic biological</p>
<p t="5568469" d="1070">What would you call it?</p>
<p t="5569539" d="6540">There&#39;s a realm of biological necessity that constitutes the boundary space within which human interactions that have to take place</p>
<p t="5576079" d="4080">I mean, I can&#39;t be so violent that I kill everyone in my tribe</p>
<p t="5580409" d="5629">That&#39;s not to be very helpful because I&#39;m a tribal creature so without the tribe what am I going to do and?</p>
<p t="5586169" d="2000">So I have to be vaguely</p>
<p t="5588329" d="6310">Acceptable to other people because otherwise they&#39;ll kill me even if I&#39;m really really powerful. They&#39;ll take me down and so</p>
<p t="5595190" d="2720">Because I have to deal with you and you and you and you and you?</p>
<p t="5598280" d="6589">we&#39;re going to modify each other continually and and within parameters now the parameters are wide but they&#39;re not non-existent and</p>
<p t="5605300" d="2209">You know you can see what those parameters are</p>
<p t="5607910" d="6350">Genuinely if you look at a something like a wolf pack or a chimpanzee troop because those are stable across really</p>
<p t="5614660" d="5870">The structure itself is stable across at least hundreds of thousands of years if not millions of years</p>
<p t="5620530" d="2879">And so there&#39;s a there&#39;s a so</p>
<p t="5624050" d="3049">Frans De Waal shows for example that with the chimpanzee troops</p>
<p t="5628880" d="1890">if you have a</p>
<p t="5630770" d="5300">He studied them mostly at the Arnhem Zoo, and I would recommend his writings. Highly De Waal. De</p>
<p t="5636980" d="2000">Waal</p>
<p t="5639020" d="5840">He&#39;s interested in the in prototypical Moral, behavior among Chimpanzees. It&#39;s a very interesting study and</p>
<p t="5645770" d="3680">what he showed for example is that if you have a particularly the</p>
<p t="5650150" d="7039">Dominant dominance Hierarchy in Chimpanzees is male there&#39;s a female dominance Hierarchy to that overlaps the male and some of the females are more dominant</p>
<p t="5657190" d="1420">than many of the males</p>
<p t="5658610" d="7759">But the fundamental structure looks like it&#39;s patriarchal roughly speaking among chimpanzees if you put a really rough tough</p>
<p t="5666770" d="7820">Barbaric Brutal dictator Chimpanzee at the top his his reign tends to be unstable and violent because he isn&#39;t good at</p>
<p t="5674780" d="1410">negotiating</p>
<p t="5676190" d="1830">Social support and</p>
<p t="5678020" d="4370">so he doesn&#39;t have any and so that means two chimpanzees that are</p>
<p t="5682760" d="3469">friends can take him out and so that&#39;s what happens and so the</p>
<p t="5686900" d="2899">Despot Chimp is an unstable leader and</p>
<p t="5690440" d="3200">De Waal has shown that the more stable chimp leaders are more</p>
<p t="5694850" d="5450">Chimpanitarian? I guess would be the right word. It&#39;s not humanitarian. They they do</p>
<p t="5700850" d="2120">They have friends and you know</p>
<p t="5703880" d="5419">Friendship is predicated on reciprocity even among Chimpanzees, and so if a</p>
<p t="5709940" d="7280">Predicate of power is reciprocity then that&#39;s one of the things that alleviates the dictatorial tendency so anyways</p>
<p t="5717220" d="2000">so my point is</p>
<p t="5719390" d="2000">when a great civilization</p>
<p t="5721400" d="6199">Emerges Emerges from the amalgam of tribal groups, but and each of the tribal groups has their ethic, but that ethic</p>
<p t="5728239" d="7010">Isn&#39;t the ethics aren&#39;t entirely separate from one another that&#39;s why tribes can trade because they do trade They</p>
<p t="5735889" d="2270">interact with one another. It&#39;s kind of half...</p>
<p t="5738860" d="1500">I remember</p>
<p t="5740360" d="1529">here&#39;s how</p>
<p t="5741889" d="1080">heretofore</p>
<p t="5742969" d="5479">Separated tribes begin to trade because you don&#39;t know you meet each other across the river</p>
<p t="5748449" d="3720">It&#39;s like you got your bows and arrows and someone makes a mistake</p>
<p t="5752170" d="5699">And it&#39;s like warfare and so but you don&#39;t want to start the damn war because maybe you&#39;ll die</p>
<p t="5757869" d="4350">so you&#39;re sitting there with your bow and arrows watching these guys and now you know they&#39;re there and</p>
<p t="5762409" d="2270">So then you go back to your tribe</p>
<p t="5764679" d="3930">And you think oh man what the hell are we going to do about this and one solution is well</p>
<p t="5768610" d="1739">Let&#39;s find out where they are and then we&#39;ll go in there at night</p>
<p t="5770349" d="4110">Well like well kill a bunch of them or we&#39;ll wipe them out or something like that another solution might be</p>
<p t="5774739" d="5600">did you see all the neat stuff they had and so then what do you do is you find a border area and</p>
<p t="5780920" d="3679">You go, and you put some things out there that are valuable and you run away</p>
<p t="5784599" d="1770">And then you watch from the trees</p>
<p t="5786369" d="5310">And you see what happens when these other people discover these valuable things that you left there</p>
<p t="5791679" d="4680">And if they&#39;re like little on the psychopathic side they pick it all up and giggle and run away</p>
<p t="5796360" d="3899">And that&#39;s the end of that, but if they have any sense what they do is</p>
<p t="5800260" d="1950">They leave some cool stuff on the ground, too</p>
<p t="5802210" d="3659">And then they run off and then you can go pick up their cool stuff and leave</p>
<p t="5805869" d="3060">And then it&#39;s like step one in the trust process</p>
<p t="5808929" d="5100">And then maybe you do that you know for a year and it starts to fall into a cadence</p>
<p t="5814030" d="4859">And then maybe you know you get a little closer when you&#39;re watching watching in the bush</p>
<p t="5818889" d="4229">And then maybe one day you have enough courage to kind of come you send your biggest ugliest guy out there</p>
<p t="5823119" d="1270">And you know they&#39;d do the same</p>
<p t="5824389" d="4280">And you know they look at each other and finally they shake hands or something like that and trade?</p>
<p t="5828670" d="4319">And then well then you&#39;ve got a trading relationship established and so you can see in that</p>
<p t="5833690" d="3500">The emergence of a what would you call it negotiated?</p>
<p t="5837980" d="7009">Consensual Moral structure that allows trading to take place, and there&#39;s going to be rules Emerge right away</p>
<p t="5844989" d="2000">Which is well, you better leave me</p>
<p t="5847190" d="6949">Something that&#39;s of approximately equal value, or are not going to play the game again. That&#39;s the thing. That&#39;s so cool</p>
<p t="5854139" d="4080">is that if we only play a game once I can do whatever I want and</p>
<p t="5858980" d="4800">So that&#39;s that&#39;s what psychopaths do they play with game once and then they go play with someone else</p>
<p t="5864000" d="6500">But if we&#39;re going to play the same game over and over and over it&#39;s like the dominance hierarchy across time</p>
<p t="5870630" d="5240">there&#39;s a different rule for playing a game once than there is for playing a game a thousand times and</p>
<p t="5876630" d="2000">if we&#39;re in a relationship</p>
<p t="5878640" d="5239">The game we want to play is one that can be duplicated a thousand times, and there&#39;s really tight constraints on that</p>
<p t="5883880" d="2939">And so that&#39;s the origin that you could consider that</p>
<p t="5887460" d="1290">the Biological</p>
<p t="5888750" d="7370">It&#39;s not even biological exactly. It&#39;s predicated in biology, but it&#39;s a consequence of continual interaction the ethic emerges</p>
<p t="5896120" d="3239">it&#39;s like the rats that I told you about that you know the</p>
<p t="5899880" d="3050">Rats that play with each other the big rat has to let the little rat win</p>
<p t="5903030" d="5809">Thirty percent of the time or the little rat won&#39;t play anymore and so because the little that that&#39;s the biological</p>
<p t="5909690" d="7129">The biological framing the limitation is the little rat doesn&#39;t want to lose all the time that just produces negative emotion. It&#39;s not fun</p>
<p t="5916820" d="7860">It&#39;s not motivating. So why would the little rats go play again? So the the constraint on our interactions are our biological?</p>
<p t="5925200" d="7520">Constraints, and they manifest themselves in the patterns way across time and there isn&#39;t any difference between you and me interacting across time</p>
<p t="5933270" d="6410">Then there is between you and me acting say in the next hour so with everyone in this room. It&#39;s the same thing</p>
<p t="5939680" d="7350">It&#39;s just continual human interactions, and ethic emerges from that. Now different groups are going to code that ethic differently</p>
<p t="5947030" d="2000">So they&#39;re going to come up with different imagistic</p>
<p t="5949380" d="2000">representations and different stories</p>
<p t="5951930" d="2839">Now one of the things they&#39;re trying to figure out is</p>
<p t="5956130" d="4610">Well, let&#39;s do it. Let&#39;s do it in the tribal way you have to do this inside the tribe, too</p>
<p t="5962610" d="2780">You have a hundred people and 10 of them are</p>
<p t="5965970" d="3770">Leaders in one way or another and then out of that 10 you think well</p>
<p t="5969740" d="1750">Who&#39;s the who&#39;s the best person?</p>
<p t="5971490" d="5419">So you have to have a hierarchy of value to determine what the most important aspect of the ethic is</p>
<p t="5977160" d="3319">it&#39;s going to be something like trust because that&#39;s the predicate for</p>
<p t="5981000" d="1950">continued interaction</p>
<p t="5982950" d="8000">Trustworthiness, it&#39;s not any really really any different than honesty. It&#39;s not really any different from telling the truth. So there&#39;s a really powerful</p>
<p t="5992520" d="5569">Necessity for honesty to merge as a as a canonical value caring might Emerge</p>
<p t="6000739" d="5210">Power might Emerge right the ability to Exert physical power especially in places</p>
<p t="6005950" d="5639">Where war is a continual is continually likely and in lots of tribal landscapes? It&#39;s just non-stop</p>
<p t="6012200" d="5899">Tribal trade and warfare so but but you can see how different ethics would emerge as canonical</p>
<p t="6018500" d="6049">Depending to some degree on the situation, but trust is a really crucial one because without that there&#39;s no relationships</p>
<p t="6025100" d="4759">Ok so you&#39;ve got tribe A, and it&#39;s got its tribal gods, and it&#39;s and its traditions and all of that</p>
<p t="6030080" d="4819">It&#39;s representation of the being in its images and stories</p>
<p t="6034900" d="5010">And then you&#39;ve got tribe B and you&#39;ve got tried C and you&#39;ve got tribe D and now they&#39;re all coming together</p>
<p t="6040730" d="1950">So what happens?</p>
<p t="6042680" d="2000">Exactly well</p>
<p t="6045470" d="2000">the tribes can go to war</p>
<p t="6047690" d="5930">or they can talk and we&#39;re we&#39;re thinking about a communication that might be extending across a</p>
<p t="6053930" d="2119">Thousand years you have your beliefs</p>
<p t="6056050" d="4830">I have my beliefs I can overwhelm you I can subsume you but even then</p>
<p t="6061190" d="2689">I&#39;m likely just to get indigestion from doing it</p>
<p t="6063880" d="5879">it&#39;s very very difficult to wipe out a set of beliefs without wiping out all of the people and that kind of</p>
<p t="6070220" d="2419">Nullifies the utility of unification the</p>
<p t="6073220" d="4339">More there are of you the better you can defend yourself against other</p>
<p t="6079040" d="2029">organizations that are trying to be larger</p>
<p t="6081070" d="4169">so there&#39;s a powerful self preservation impetus to</p>
<p t="6085580" d="810">Cooperation and</p>
<p t="6086390" d="5449">So one of the things you see happening in the development of the stories in the old testament for example we know this about</p>
<p t="6091940" d="2000">genesis in particular that there were at least</p>
<p t="6094760" d="2900">this is this is relatively recently so say for</p>
<p t="6098210" d="1380">3,000 years ago</p>
<p t="6099590" d="7910">Not 50,000 years ago there were two different stories. There&#39;s two different stories in the genesis account told by two different</p>
<p t="6108560" d="6859">Storytellers and people who are very good at textual analysis of being able to separate them and they were put together...</p>
<p t="6116120" d="2629">I don&#39;t remember when. Again it&#39;s probably about</p>
<p t="6119450" d="2449">Something between 2,000 and 3,000 years ago</p>
<p t="6121900" d="5399">they were put together by what appeared to be a single editor and so he took these disparate accounts and</p>
<p t="6127840" d="6870">Try to organize them into something that looked like a logical narrative, and that was part of the process by which different tribal</p>
<p t="6136040" d="5809">Representations of the world were brought into something under which the tribes as you as a unit could</p>
<p t="6142640" d="4250">Simultaneously exist so you can think about it as a competition between imagistic</p>
<p t="6147350" d="4850">representations across time and then the emergence of some unifying narratives that that</p>
<p t="6152600" d="4970">Captures the key elements of all of them well enough to bring them into some sort of union</p>
<p t="6157570" d="2700">And it has to be a story with motivational power</p>
<p t="6160760" d="4310">Because otherwise no one will caught on to it and it has to be a story that keeps</p>
<p t="6165410" d="4820">Uncertainty at Bay because otherwise it doesn&#39;t have any utility it has to be a functional story</p>
<p t="6170360" d="4970">so I&#39;m going to tell you a story like that in the story of Marduk, and it&#39;s the mesopotamian story and</p>
<p t="6176000" d="2000">Mesopotamia is one of the earliest</p>
<p t="6178340" d="4910">Civilizations, and it emerged as a consequence of the amalgam of of Middle Eastern tribes</p>
<p t="6183470" d="2270">so that over a very long period of time</p>
<p t="6186020" d="4790">You could think that the gods of all of these tribes were warring in an abstract</p>
<p t="6190940" d="7159">space in a conceptual space and that would be the space of argumentation and conflict and out of that a meta story emerged and</p>
<p t="6198320" d="1430">This is the Meta story</p>
<p t="6199750" d="6239">And it&#39;s one of a host of similar meta stories that came out of the Middle East one of which is the account in Genesis</p>
<p t="6206120" d="2000">Okay, so here&#39;s the story</p>
<p t="6208880" d="2989">So there are two primary</p>
<p t="6212630" d="2359">deities to begin with Apsu and</p>
<p t="6215750" d="7069">Tiamat now in order to understand that well here&#39;s how the mesopotamians conceptualized the world</p>
<p t="6225410" d="2450">there was a let&#39;s call it a disc that&#39;s</p>
<p t="6229070" d="1560">saltwater</p>
<p t="6230630" d="1170">Why?</p>
<p t="6231800" d="4729">Well what happens when you go to the end of the continent and saw water everywhere, right?</p>
<p t="6236530" d="5250">So wherever you go you run into saltwater, so that&#39;s the disc that surrounds everything now</p>
<p t="6241780" d="4169">Why is it a disc the world is a dome on a disc. Why?</p>
<p t="6246890" d="3740">Well say you&#39;re standing in the middle of the field what does the world look like?</p>
<p t="6252050" d="2000">dome</p>
<p t="6254180" d="3080">On a disc so it&#39;s a phenomenological</p>
<p t="6257900" d="5509">Representation so the bottom of the dome is the ground which you stand what happens if you dig</p>
<p t="6264290" d="2329">You hit water fresh water</p>
<p t="6267440" d="4040">So the dome of the land is on a disk of fresh water</p>
<p t="6272180" d="2930">What happens if you go to the edge of the land you run into salt water?</p>
<p t="6275240" d="4010">The dome of the land is on a disk of fresh water on a disk of salt water</p>
<p t="6280100" d="2840">Okay, those are the two gods Tiamat is</p>
<p t="6282940" d="3089">God of salt water and Apsu fresh water</p>
<p t="6286030" d="7589">And it&#39;s it&#39;s happenstance in some sense because that&#39;s the masculine and the feminine and they could be attributed all sorts of different</p>
<p t="6294260" d="2299">geographical areas so for example</p>
<p t="6300020" d="2000">see if I can think of a good example</p>
<p t="6306200" d="2000">Doesn&#39;t matter. I&#39;ll just leave that for now</p>
<p t="6310250" d="7849">Okay, so the two primary gods are Apsu and Tiamat. Tiamat is female and Apsu is male and they&#39;re locked</p>
<p t="6318100" d="2000">Together in an</p>
<p t="6320270" d="1470">inseparable embrace</p>
<p t="6321740" d="3050">Okay, so how do you understand that? Easy. Yin and Yang?</p>
<p t="6325400" d="6589">It&#39;s the same idea here&#39;s here&#39;s another representation. This is a cool one. I&#39;ve got a couple of them here. That are really cool</p>
<p t="6332780" d="2000">this is from China, so</p>
<p t="6336260" d="1530">this is</p>
<p t="6337790" d="2089">so this is fuxi and</p>
<p t="6340610" d="3620">You I think I&#39;ve got that right, but I just love that reference.</p>
<p t="6344230" d="5669">It&#39;s so insanely cool this representation, so you see the sort of the primary</p>
<p t="6350870" d="3470">mother and father of humanity emerging from this underlying Snake-like</p>
<p t="6355580" d="2420">entity with its tails tangled together.</p>
<p t="6358670" d="6259">I think that&#39;s a rep.. I really do believe this although. It&#39;s very complicated to explain why I really believe that&#39;s a representation of DNA</p>
<p t="6366200" d="3500">So and that that representation that entwined</p>
<p t="6370280" d="2899">Double helix that is everywhere you can see it in</p>
<p t="6373760" d="6979">Australian Aboriginal art and I&#39;m using the Australians as an example because they were isolated in Australia for like 50,000 years</p>
<p t="6380740" d="5970">There&#39;s the most archaic people that were ever discovered and they have clear representations of these double helix structures in their art</p>
<p t="6386710" d="4949">So and those are the two giant serpents out of which the world is made roughly speaking</p>
<p t="6391880" d="2299">It&#39;s the same thing you see that in the Staff of Asclepius</p>
<p t="6394340" d="6830">Which is the healing symbol that the physicians use although usually that&#39;s only one snake but sometimes it&#39;s two so so</p>
<p t="6401810" d="5179">So that&#39;s a that&#39;s a Chinese representation, and then there&#39;s a there&#39;s this</p>
<p t="6408170" d="2000">That&#39;s the Egyptian representation</p>
<p t="6411170" d="4549">We talked about the Egyptian story the other day right we talked about Isis and Osiris</p>
<p t="6417740" d="5840">So there they are cobras their tails are twined together see they emerge out of that. That&#39;s the dragon of Chaos</p>
<p t="6424820" d="3859">That manifests itself as culture in nature. That&#39;s the representation</p>
<p t="6429260" d="2000">That&#39;s unbelievably cool</p>
<p t="6431270" d="1290">So okay</p>
<p t="6432560" d="2329">so anyways back to back to</p>
<p t="6435560" d="2359">to the mesopotamian story, so</p>
<p t="6438590" d="6979">Apsu and Tiamat are their primordial deities nature and culture. They&#39;re entwined together and they give rise to the</p>
<p t="6446150" d="1590">to their first</p>
<p t="6447740" d="4430">Category of children and those are the I think you could think about them as the elder gods</p>
<p t="6452840" d="1320">now</p>
<p t="6454160" d="1110">I</p>
<p t="6455270" d="4189">What do they represent well the question is what did the gods represent and they represent?</p>
<p t="6459650" d="4069">They represent sort of like primary modes of being it&#39;s something like that</p>
<p t="6463780" d="6899">So think about Ares or Mars the god of war well, that&#39;s that&#39;s a representation of single-Minded aggression</p>
<p t="6470710" d="3689">And then you can think about Eros or Venus which is a primary</p>
<p t="6474920" d="3319">Representation of sexuality and you might say well, why are those deities?</p>
<p t="6478790" d="2959">Well that&#39;s simple. They live forever and</p>
<p t="6482390" d="6230">They control you and their personalities, so that&#39;s that for that. It&#39;s like yes, obviously</p>
<p t="6489140" d="4910">you know and you know that you&#39;re under the sway of anger you&#39;re not in control of yourself if you&#39;re under the sway of</p>
<p t="6494870" d="4969">Erotic possession you make a fool out of yourself. You&#39;re a tool of the power that drives the</p>
<p t="6500570" d="4459">Continuation of the species forward. Hunger is the same thing. Any primordial</p>
<p t="6506120" d="4099">motivational drive. We&#39;ve conceptualized in this class as a personality.</p>
<p t="6510220" d="4080">But those are transcendent personalities and their eternal their forever</p>
<p t="6514300" d="4770">And so that&#39;s why the Greeks for example thought that human beings were just the playthings of the gods</p>
<p t="6519350" d="6679">this idea is echoed in the mesopotamian story, so then you can think about it, sort of neural developmentally as well is that out of</p>
<p t="6526550" d="2000">out of nothing</p>
<p t="6528730" d="1570">of culture nature</p>
<p t="6530300" d="7970">emerges say the two-year-old the two-year-old is a battleground of primary motivational forces and something like that is being hinted at in the</p>
<p t="6538550" d="1170">mesopotamian</p>
<p t="6539720" d="2000">creation story the first</p>
<p t="6542450" d="1410">the first</p>
<p t="6543860" d="6500">Progeny of the fundamental union of chaos and order Apsu and Tiamat is the proliferation of these</p>
<p t="6551150" d="4160">primary motivational forces, they&#39;re sort of like the Titans or the or the</p>
<p t="6556550" d="2510">what it wasn&#39;t the Greek gods kept in the</p>
<p t="6560180" d="2000">Underneath the Mountain that&#39;s Zeus</p>
<p t="6562760" d="1950">What&#39;s the name of that?</p>
<p t="6564710" d="5149">They&#39;re like prime.. they&#39;re earthquakes and fires and that sort of thing. They&#39;re primordial forces.</p>
<p t="6569860" d="4379">Okay anyways, so these children are produced and what happens.?</p>
<p t="6574910" d="4159">They&#39;re very noisy. They run around doing all sorts of things you can think about them as grown-up</p>
<p t="6579200" d="4250">two-year-olds causing all sorts of trouble the first thing they do is kill Apsu and</p>
<p t="6584420" d="3830">And make their homeowners corpse that&#39;s brilliant now</p>
<p t="6588250" d="5279">the Story doesn&#39;t say much about Apsu other than that the the culture deity the</p>
<p t="6594710" d="3740">Primary Culture deity is not elaborated up that much in the mesopotamian story</p>
<p t="6598450" d="7559">And I think that&#39;s probably because at the time of the mesopotamian civilization was new enough so that we really hadn&#39;t mapped</p>
<p t="6607160" d="4759">The mythology of culture the Egyptians did that much more and I know I told you that story first.</p>
<p t="6611920" d="7439">But that&#39;s just how it goes. So the the elder gods make their their home on the corpse of Apsu.</p>
<p t="6619360" d="6780">Well, what does that mean? Well, that&#39;s that&#39;s sort of how it is. You inhabit the corpse of culture, right?</p>
<p t="6626140" d="2000">it&#39;s the dead past and</p>
<p t="6628580" d="1110">but</p>
<p t="6629690" d="4549">But it&#39;s not just the dead past one of the things that&#39;s very cool about the mesopotamian story</p>
<p t="6634239" d="5490">Is that the elder gods are foolish enough to kill it. It&#39;s the death of God by the way.</p>
<p t="6639730" d="7529">It&#39;s no different from what Nietzsche pronounced. This has been going on for a very very long time. This collapse of belief systems</p>
<p t="6648440" d="1890">They kill it carelessly.</p>
<p t="6650330" d="2689">Because they don&#39;t understand what it is that they need to survive.</p>
<p t="6653020" d="3540">They kill it careless carelessly, and then they try to live on the corpse.</p>
<p t="6658550" d="2000">I think that&#39;s what the postmodernists is do by the way.</p>
<p t="6661360" d="6379">Because they assume we have this tremendous system of value that&#39;s being built up across time and it</p>
<p t="6668380" d="2000">sustains us and</p>
<p t="6670540" d="4579">Everyone is criticizing it and criticizing it and trying to destroy it. Well</p>
<p t="6675369" d="6110">we live in its corpse and that will nourish us forever it has to be replenished.</p>
<p t="6681480" d="4799">And there&#39;s nothing in the postmodernist philosophy that can act to replenish. Anyways</p>
<p t="6688420" d="3410">They kill Apsu. What happens when you kill order?</p>
<p t="6693340" d="3919">Chaos comes back. Tiamat. Now this Tiamat.</p>
<p t="6700389" d="1500">Here.</p>
<p t="6701889" d="3620">Feminine, but also the dragon, so it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s...</p>
<p t="6706330" d="3020">You think out of this fundamental</p>
<p t="6710230" d="2000">reptilian treasure bearer</p>
<p t="6712330" d="4579">Culture and Nature emerge and they can pull back into that very rapidly. So here&#39;s an example,</p>
<p t="6717010" d="5840">You&#39;ve all seen Sleeping Beauty. I presumed. How many of you have seen Sleeping Beauty? The Disney film. How many of you haven&#39;t?</p>
<p t="6723460" d="7819">Okay, so there&#39;s a couple that haven&#39;t. There&#39;s a scene in Sleeping Beauty where the evil queen has has imprisoned the prince who&#39;s</p>
<p t="6731280" d="1350">going to wake sleeping beauty up</p>
<p t="6732630" d="6000">So he&#39;s the logos or he&#39;s that he&#39;s the heroic individual or he&#39;s that element of her consciousness that wakes her up. You can</p>
<p t="6738630" d="1540">read it either way.</p>
<p t="6740170" d="2000">She&#39;s got him trapped in a dungeon</p>
<p t="6742199" d="1571">So she&#39;s the kind of ultable</p>
<p t="6743770" d="5599">ultimate Oedipal mother you know. She&#39;s the mother that has her 40 year-old son in the basement who is like</p>
<p t="6749560" d="6109">Overweight and unhealthy and watched and watching video games and being covered with cheeto dust and she always like feeds him sandwiches so he won&#39;t</p>
<p t="6755670" d="2699">leave you know. And she says oh, it&#39;s good thing</p>
<p t="6758369" d="3810">You didn&#39;t go out the world make some poor woman miserable. So anyway</p>
<p t="6762179" d="6390">So that&#39;s the evil queen he&#39;s got the hero trapped in the dungeon. So he goes out he escapes and then</p>
<p t="6769239" d="3229">She goes after him to try to bring him back and turns into the dragon</p>
<p t="6772469" d="6570">that&#39;s what happens in Sleeping Beauty, so that&#39;s that reversion of the of the archetype into it&#39;s even more primordial force. So</p>
<p t="6779619" d="6650">anyway, so Tiamat kind of an amalgam of feminine, nature, and also this more underlying primordial symbol. So anyway</p>
<p t="6786270" d="1210">She is not happy</p>
<p t="6787480" d="7009">She is not happy that these her children killed her husband and so she thinks oh well enough of these creatures we&#39;re gonna</p>
<p t="6794790" d="6240">we&#39;re gonna do them in. It&#39;s the flood myth. The same idea. So what happens in the story of Noah this happens worldwide</p>
<p t="6801030" d="430">is that</p>
<p t="6801460" d="5600">Human beings get all corrupt and make a lot of racket and break all sorts of rules and God thinks oh, well, you know</p>
<p t="6807580" d="5330">Enough of you, we&#39;ll just bring in a flood and wipe y&#39;all out. That&#39;s chaos returning you destabilize</p>
<p t="6813460" d="1530">order too badly.</p>
<p t="6814990" d="2389">There&#39;s a flood and that brings with it</p>
<p t="6817380" d="5370">all Sorts of new things because it&#39;s water, but it just drowns you it drowns you. Now Noah is a good man</p>
<p t="6822750" d="1380">so he can ride out the flood.</p>
<p t="6824130" d="6810">He&#39;s the hero that can go down into the Chaos and then back up because he hasn&#39;t let go of his</p>
<p t="6831370" d="2989">Morality despite the fact that the entire society has disintegrated.</p>
<p t="6834910" d="7399">So he saves everything so it&#39;s it&#39;s like Moses crossing the Red Sea and then coming out the other side same same sort of idea.</p>
<p t="6843130" d="6200">Anyways, so Tiamat she&#39;s uh she&#39;s not happy and these gods are careless too and impulsive.</p>
<p t="6849330" d="6359">They&#39;re making a lot of noise and their activity disturbs her. You know and you can see echoes of that fear</p>
<p t="6857140" d="4729">that mythological fear in modern consciousness because we tell ourselves the same story.</p>
<p t="6862570" d="4040">Right? The story is if we keep running around making enough</p>
<p t="6866740" d="4699">racket mother Nature is going to take offense and wipe us out, and that&#39;s the story that&#39;s at</p>
<p t="6871440" d="3660">the bottom of the Sort of Apocalyptic element of the Global warming</p>
<p t="6878380" d="6110">Apocalypse it&#39;s like if we if we mock about badly enough nature will take its revenge, okay fine. It&#39;s true. It&#39;s true</p>
<p t="6884560" d="3649">It&#39;s so it&#39;s a story that&#39;s always been true. So anyways</p>
<p t="6889030" d="1700">The Gods are making a lot of noise</p>
<p t="6890730" d="3240">They&#39;re being impulsive, and then they make the fatal error of killing Apsu</p>
<p t="6893970" d="4409">And that&#39;s a big mistake, and so Tiamat thinks alright enough of this. She wakes up</p>
<p t="6898380" d="5580">and she thinks I&#39;m going to wipe them all out. Now that these gods their gods eh I mean, they&#39;re not trivial</p>
<p t="6905170" d="7850">Characters, but they&#39;re pretty worried because their gods, but Tiamat is their mother she gave birth to them she&#39;s mother nature, and if she&#39;s angry</p>
<p t="6913660" d="2479">About it then the Jig&#39;s up</p>
<p t="6916200" d="3869">so what Timat does is she prepares this army of monsters and</p>
<p t="6920290" d="4759">That they&#39;re described there&#39;s I think 13 different kinds of Monsters, and they&#39;re chimeric</p>
<p t="6925600" d="2120">Images, they&#39;re images of you know</p>
<p t="6928319" d="6930">They&#39;re like dragons. They&#39;re half snake and half bird and half animal and they&#39;re monstrous images, and they&#39;re sort of the</p>
<p t="6936729" d="6800">Mesopotamians attempt to imagisticly represent those things that might come forward as an onslaught and so generates a whole</p>
<p t="6944349" d="1830">13 major</p>
<p t="6946179" d="5779">Monsters and then puts a whole army behind them and she elects one of them Qingu is his name as head</p>
<p t="6952419" d="3590">Monster so he&#39;s for all intents and purposes. He&#39;s an early</p>
<p t="6956559" d="2689">representation of Satan he&#39;s Like King of the bad guys and</p>
<p t="6959530" d="3919">it&#39;s important to know about him because if something happens later in the story, so</p>
<p t="6964089" d="3830">so Tiamat&#39;s preparing her army of monsters to</p>
<p t="6969099" d="2000">chimeras to</p>
<p t="6971919" d="1530">wipe out, the</p>
<p t="6973449" d="3139">Gods, and so they&#39;re like shorting out about this</p>
<p t="6976589" d="5400">but while they&#39;re doing it, they&#39;re still making a lot of racket and living the highlife in Apsu&#39;s corpse and and</p>
<p t="6982569" d="3050">Propagating and while they&#39;re doing that they send out one</p>
<p t="6986019" d="4910">God after another to combat Tiamat and they all come back failed.</p>
<p t="6991089" d="4250">So whatever these elder gods are whatever they represent. They&#39;re not</p>
<p t="6996099" d="5089">Whatever it is that can confront Chaos successfully and prevail their powers</p>
<p t="7001189" d="2790">But they&#39;re not whatever that is that ultimate power</p>
<p t="7003979" d="5069">and that&#39;s what the mesopotamians are trying to figure out who or what is king of the gods and</p>
<p t="7009569" d="2660">king of the gods is the thing that confront Chaos and</p>
<p t="7012749" d="2000">regenerate order, so</p>
<p t="7015989" d="4189">So they keep producing new gods and one day they produce Marduk</p>
<p t="7020459" d="801">He&#39;s born,</p>
<p t="7021260" d="1089">and marduk he he&#39;s a whole new</p>
<p t="7022349" d="5330">Category of God and every one of the gods knows it and he&#39;s got some very strange attributes one of them is</p>
<p t="7027869" d="6410">He could speak Magic words and so when Marduk speaks the night sky transforms into the day sky and vice versa.</p>
<p t="7034280" d="5219">So he&#39;s he&#39;s the verbal capacity it&#39;s a massive discovery. It&#39;s a massive discovery by the</p>
<p t="7040499" d="5930">mesopotamians because it&#39;s the first time we know of that the idea that it&#39;s the capacity for communicative speech as the</p>
<p t="7046649" d="3709">Primary deity should be at the top of the dominance hierarchy.</p>
<p t="7050359" d="5280">It&#39;s one of the most remarkable discoveries of the ages and he also has eyes all the way around his head</p>
<p t="7056249" d="5930">So Marduk is the thing that can speak and see and it&#39;s the thing that&#39;s so all the gods</p>
<p t="7062180" d="3629">Think wow well this is a whole new thing man. How about you go out and</p>
<p t="7066360" d="5660">combat Tiamat. Well it doesn&#39;t sound like much of a picnic. You know the logical thing for any sensible</p>
<p t="7072020" d="4739">god to say is how about no, but Marduk doesn&#39;t say that he says look. I&#39;ll make you guys a deal</p>
<p t="7077910" d="4159">You get yourself together in a whole you know and you have a vote</p>
<p t="7082410" d="3829">for all intents and purposes and you vote me king of the gods and</p>
<p t="7087090" d="2990">Allow me from here on in to Determine destinies</p>
<p t="7090080" d="5159">That&#39;s exactly what the mesopotamian say he gets the tablet of destiny and he&#39;s now in control of it</p>
<p t="7095239" d="2520">So the mesopotamians are working out this idea that</p>
<p t="7097760" d="4440">It&#39;s the thing that can see and that can talk that should be the thing that guides destiny</p>
<p t="7102200" d="5459">especially if destiny involves having to go into combat with Chaos itself and</p>
<p t="7108030" d="3830">Restructure the world and so Marduk says those are the terms.</p>
<p t="7111860" d="5700">I&#39;ll do it but I&#39;m king of the gods, and they all think well at the fools can quote didn&#39;t get killed anyway</p>
<p t="7117560" d="5759">so you know what do we have to lose and so they agreed and so Marduk goes out to combat Tiamat and he takes a</p>
<p t="7123320" d="2220">net and a sword and</p>
<p t="7126660" d="4790">he if I remember correctly he fills her with a wind which is I believe part of the</p>
<p t="7131880" d="7640">Manifestation of this voice this voice idea he fills her with a wind he encapsulate her in a net now think about what that means</p>
<p t="7139739" d="5150">you know psychologists even used this word phrase nomological net and</p>
<p t="7145470" d="2209">a nomological net is this is the</p>
<p t="7148350" d="2540">Network of concepts that you use to encapsulate</p>
<p t="7151320" d="5060">Something new in an ideational structure and so the idea of putting something in a net is to</p>
<p t="7156660" d="5239">Put boundaries around it right and to constrain it and so some of that&#39;s actually well</p>
<p t="7161900" d="5189">You can capture a predator in a net and then cut it up, but there&#39;s no difference between that</p>
<p t="7168090" d="6020">There&#39;s a there&#39;s a tight analogy between that and cat encapsulating something novel in a conceptual</p>
<p t="7174390" d="6139">Network which then enables you to cut it up into something useful okay, so that&#39;s what happens Marduk goes out. He</p>
<p t="7181170" d="4490">confronts Tiamat he overcomes the monsters and he kills Qingu and</p>
<p t="7186300" d="6770">So and then he makes he cuts Tiamat into pieces and he makes the world and that&#39;s the world that human beings</p>
<p t="7193739" d="1250">live</p>
<p t="7194989" d="2460">On and he makes the human beings to serve the gods</p>
<p t="7198180" d="5149">okay, so that&#39;s the first part of the story now he also kills Qingu and he makes human beings out of the blood of</p>
<p t="7203330" d="1230">Qingu now</p>
<p t="7204560" d="5159">That&#39;s a hell of a story right because Qingu is king of the demons and human beings are the creature</p>
<p t="7209880" d="2479">That&#39;s made out of the blood of the king of the demons</p>
<p t="7212640" d="4639">it&#39;s a very similar idea to the idea the later sort of egyptian and</p>
<p t="7217800" d="7010">Judeo-Christian ideas that there&#39;s a Satanic element to being that&#39;s also characteristic of human beings and part of that is well</p>
<p t="7224810" d="6419">What&#39;s the difference between human beings and every other element of being and the answer that is human beings can deceive you?</p>
<p t="7232380" d="2270">Right, we&#39;re the only creatures that can do that</p>
<p t="7234840" d="4640">We&#39;re capable of deception. Voluntary deception, we&#39;re capable of malevolence.</p>
<p t="7239480" d="6270">And so that&#39;s echoed as well in the story in genesis because when Adam and Eve eat the apple</p>
<p t="7245910" d="5779">They wake up the scales fall from their eyes they recognize that they&#39;re naked and they know the difference between good and evil</p>
<p t="7252000" d="5899">which means they can do evil and it took me a long time to figure that out what that meant so imagine because there&#39;s a</p>
<p t="7257900" d="6390">Causal sequence eh. The snake offers you something that you ingest it wakes you up the scales fall from your eyes</p>
<p t="7264290" d="6359">So now you can see the first thing you do is you realize that you&#39;re naked what does that mean well human being stand upright?</p>
<p t="7271110" d="4459">The most vulnerable part of us is front and center to be hurt</p>
<p t="7275570" d="5520">But also to be judged right to be naked is to be that&#39;s terrifying you want to not die</p>
<p t="7281520" d="5449">You want to cover yourself up, and so that&#39;s the recognition of nakedness, but then you might say well</p>
<p t="7286969" d="4410">Why does the knowledge of good and evil emerge from that? As soon as you know you&#39;re naked and vulnerable</p>
<p t="7291989" d="1980">you know how to hurt other people.</p>
<p t="7293969" d="5210">You&#39;re not a predator anymore, because they&#39;ll just tear you apart and eat you like they don&#39;t want you to suffer although</p>
<p t="7299180" d="5879">They don&#39;t care they don&#39;t want you to suffer. They just want to eat you but once I know what hurts me.</p>
<p t="7305760" d="6560">I know what hurts you and then I can turn that into an art and people have done that and so that&#39;s that&#39;s why the knowledge</p>
<p t="7312320" d="3390">of evil comes immediately as a consequence of the knowledge of of</p>
<p t="7315930" d="6500">Nakedness, and that&#39;s associated with the same idea that human beings are made out of the blood of Qingu. Nasty stories,</p>
<p t="7322430" d="5219">but very you know they&#39;re messing with the fundamental structure reality they want to get this right.</p>
<p t="7328489" d="6840">Ok so one of the cool things about this story, so okay, so that&#39;s Marduk. Now here&#39;s what&#39;s so interesting about that.</p>
<p t="7336330" d="5419">The mesopotamians they&#39;ve got this story about the deities and how they organize themselves to</p>
<p t="7342180" d="6319">Respond to the emergence of Chaos and how to master it. You you go after it you you declare yourself the thing at the top</p>
<p t="7348500" d="4770">Of the dominance hierarchy, your eyes and speech you, go out there voluntarily, you</p>
<p t="7354210" d="6770">encapsulate the Chaos, you cut it into pieces and you make the world. That makes you top god. Brilliant bloody absolutely</p>
<p t="7361590" d="6140">Phenomenally brilliant, so what happens that&#39;s what&#39;s happening in the heavenly domain. Let&#39;s say what happens in the earthly domain</p>
<p t="7368280" d="7370">The emperor of the mesopotamians is Marduk. He&#39;s a manifestation of Marduk on Earth, and he has to be a good Marduk</p>
<p t="7375650" d="2850">That&#39;s because you might say well, why should you be king?</p>
<p t="7379440" d="5029">Well the answer to that is while you&#39;re most powerful. No, that&#39;s not going to work some other weasels will take you out</p>
<p t="7385140" d="2659">Why should you be king well because you pay attention?</p>
<p t="7387800" d="4740">And you speak properly and you keep Chaos at bay, and you make ingenious things happen as a consequence</p>
<p t="7392850" d="4879">So that&#39;s what the bloody mesopotamians were trying to work out. What should be sovereign and why.</p>
<p t="7398460" d="3200">Okay, so what did they do in the new year ceremony, so</p>
<p t="7402180" d="6949">Imagine that they&#39;re there. They&#39;re the king is in a walled city, right? So that&#39;s the kings at the top of the dominance hierarchy</p>
<p t="7409130" d="5129">He&#39;s the eye at the top of the pyramid in a walled city with Chaos outside. Chaos is outside</p>
<p t="7414260" d="3180">That&#39;s the domain of Tiamat at the New Year ceremony</p>
<p t="7417960" d="2149">The old year we know about that</p>
<p t="7420110" d="2340">We still have this idea the old year is an old man</p>
<p t="7422730" d="5060">The New Year is about to be born there&#39;s an intermediary period of Chaos that&#39;s New Year&#39;s Eve</p>
<p t="7427790" d="6029">right that&#39;s the intermediate period of Chaos where all the rules are temporarily suspended which is why you can go out and</p>
<p t="7434010" d="4100">Party like there&#39;s no tomorrow New Year&#39;s Eve and before the New Year is born</p>
<p t="7438480" d="5689">The mesopotamian emperor and all of his retinue and the people go outside the city on New Year&#39;s Eve</p>
<p t="7444170" d="3510">And they take statues that represent the gods and they act out</p>
<p t="7448410" d="2000">the</p>
<p t="7451170" d="3620">Story that I just told you with the statues and as part of that</p>
<p t="7455790" d="1260">the</p>
<p t="7457050" d="2000">Emperor has to take off all his</p>
<p t="7459270" d="3919">Garb his garments that make him king and me in front of the priest and the priest</p>
<p t="7463320" d="2540">If I remember correctly slaps him with a glove</p>
<p t="7465860" d="1299">it&#39;s something like that and</p>
<p t="7467159" d="4609">Tells him that he has to tell everyone why in the last year he wasn&#39;t a very good Marduk</p>
<p t="7471769" d="1450">And how he&#39;s going to do better in the future</p>
<p t="7473219" d="3319">Which is exactly by the way, what do you do when you make your New Year&#39;s?</p>
<p t="7477329" d="1980">What do you call those?</p>
<p t="7479309" d="2479">Yes, the ones you immediately break the next day</p>
<p t="7481789" d="6120">But it&#39;s the same it&#39;s this renewal idea that happens that it happens in the depth of darkness in the middle of the winter before</p>
<p t="7488099" d="3140">the light comes back right that&#39;s why it&#39;s set up that way, so</p>
<p t="7492420" d="3020">so anyways and so that so as long as</p>
<p t="7495900" d="4310">The emperor is a good Marduk then that&#39;s why he gets to be emperor, and if he&#39;s not a good Marduk</p>
<p t="7500210" d="3779">Then well someone else should the emperor so so that&#39;s how that works</p>
<p t="7509249" d="3500">and there&#39;s some representations of it, so there&#39;s</p>
<p t="7513869" d="1531">There&#39;s</p>
<p t="7515400" d="2000">Tiamat there</p>
<p t="7517530" d="6739">Sort of spirit matter combination winged dragon right the thing that we&#39;ve seen so many times and there is Marduk. He&#39;s got angel wings</p>
<p t="7525570" d="6379">Why the wings I don&#39;t know exactly why the wings I mean he&#39;s obviously being assimilated to the idea of a bird</p>
<p t="7531949" d="7799">I don&#39;t know if the idea of the far-seeing capacity of the bird was there for the mesopotamians highly probable</p>
<p t="7540210" d="6049">But also the bird is something that flies up above everything else and that can see for long distances, so it&#39;s an aerial spirit</p>
<p t="7546260" d="1229">It&#39;s close to God and all of that</p>
<p t="7547489" d="7259">So so there&#39;s a very primordial representation of the same thing look how much imagination does it take to see</p>
<p t="7555329" d="3290">That that&#39;s the story of human beings encountering the unknown</p>
<p t="7561269" d="3110">You know when you know the code it just seems self-evident. Yes</p>
<p t="7564380" d="5369">well there is he&#39;s got his bow and arrow you know and he&#39;s out there fighting the monsters of the unknown and that&#39;s</p>
<p t="7569880" d="5419">Part that how human beings have survived yeah, yeah, that&#39;s and then here</p>
<p t="7575300" d="5219">He&#39;s riding this great big snake. So that&#39;s another representation of the same kind of thing</p>
<p t="7582119" d="5330">Okay, so let me just think for a minute you&#39;ll figure out what I want to do next if I want to go somewhere next</p>
<p t="7587449" d="2850">I guess what I&#39;ll do right. Now is I&#39;ll just show you some additional pictures</p>
<p t="7590820" d="3529">So we&#39;ve laid out the conceptual world to some degree, right?</p>
<p t="7595160" d="2490">mentioned that you can think about it as the</p>
<p t="7598740" d="4879">Potential itself, that&#39;s the dragon of Chaos and then nature which has a positive and a negative element</p>
<p t="7604440" d="3860">Creation and destruction and culture which has a positive and negative emotion</p>
<p t="7608550" d="7429">element there reverse day because it&#39;s the positive element of culture that protects you against the negative element of nature and the negative element of</p>
<p t="7616980" d="6800">Culture can be destroyed by the new coming in from the from the natural world and then the archetypal individual</p>
<p t="7623880" d="7849">Positive and negative as well. That&#39;s the that&#39;s the entire story roughly speaking, and I showed you its manifestations and figures like this</p>
<p t="7632580" d="2209">So you have this is called the open virgin</p>
<p t="7635370" d="4879">The opening virgin because that those two halves can be closed</p>
<p t="7640250" d="5310">So there&#39;s mother nature roughly speaking or the mother of God depending on how you look at it</p>
<p t="7646230" d="2000">and inside her nature</p>
<p t="7648870" d="4490">Culture the Patriarchy the culture supports the suffering individual who?</p>
<p t="7653850" d="6589">Voluntarily accepts death and mortality as the price to be paid for being that&#39;s what that image represents</p>
<p t="7660720" d="1950">It&#39;s absolutely</p>
<p t="7662670" d="3080">Unbelievable, and then you see all these people that decide here are gazing</p>
<p t="7666360" d="1190">uncontrollably at this image</p>
<p t="7667550" d="4889">which is of course exactly what&#39;s happened over the last two thousand years at least in part of the world because</p>
<p t="7672660" d="2000">There&#39;s there&#39;s a tremendous idea</p>
<p t="7675480" d="5090">encapsulated inside that image and the image the idea is something like the voluntary acceptance of</p>
<p t="7681060" d="4040">Suffering is key to its transcendence, and that&#39;s that&#39;s a that&#39;s a crucial</p>
<p t="7685980" d="1890">psychotherapeutic truth, right</p>
<p t="7687870" d="5810">Things that bother you need to be confronted voluntarily you have to accept them you have to accept them you think well how far does?</p>
<p t="7693680" d="2000">That go well we don&#39;t know</p>
<p t="7695850" d="2300">It works in small things it works with phobias</p>
<p t="7698150" d="6989">It works with traumas traumas are usually associated with death or disease or malevolence. So that&#39;s pushing it pretty far</p>
<p t="7705300" d="4759">There doesn&#39;t seem to be a limit to the to the idea that the voluntary</p>
<p t="7710550" d="4129">Confrontation with the things that are terrifying is curative there doesn&#39;t seem to be a limit to that</p>
<p t="7714720" d="4549">There&#39;s an example in the story of Exodus when Moses is leading the Israelites through the desert</p>
<p t="7720510" d="7009">They fragment because while they&#39;re out of tyranny so they don&#39;t know what to do. It&#39;s all chaotic, and you know this Moses character</p>
<p t="7727520" d="1650">Yeah, you got them out of Egypt but now</p>
<p t="7729170" d="750">They&#39;re in the desert</p>
<p t="7729920" d="6149">And there&#39;s nothing to eat and like why should they listen to him and so they start worshipping all sorts of idols and that&#39;s kind</p>
<p t="7736070" d="6120">Of like the fragmentation of what holds them centrally together and so what does God do he&#39;s not very happy about that</p>
<p t="7742860" d="3620">Whoo so he sends a bunch of poisonous snakes into the desert to bite them all</p>
<p t="7747090" d="5390">He thinks enough of these people. And that&#39;s chaos returning right in the form of these poisonous snakes and so</p>
<p t="7753300" d="4939">The Israelites are kind of sick and tired of being bitten by poisonous snakes so they go back to Moses</p>
<p t="7758239" d="3270">And they say well, you know I know we&#39;ve wandered off the path here</p>
<p t="7761510" d="2010">And we didn&#39;t think you were the greatest guy there for a while</p>
<p t="7763520" d="5489">but you know maybe who could have a little chat with God and see what he could do about these poisonous snakes and so so</p>
<p t="7769260" d="5990">Moses entreats God to do something about the snakes and what God tells people to do the strangest thing he says</p>
<p t="7776370" d="4789">make a snake in the image make a bronze snake and put it on a post and</p>
<p t="7781650" d="5240">Have everyone look at it. And everyone who goes to look at the snake won&#39;t be bitten by the poisonous snakes anymore</p>
<p t="7786890" d="2399">I just saw this it&#39;s it just</p>
<p t="7791040" d="7069">Crazy that idea. It&#39;s crazy so and I&#39;ll tell you something else else. That&#39;s very interesting so in that in the Christian story</p>
<p t="7798810" d="6290">Christ assimilates himself to that snake that was put on the post in the desert says exactly the same thing that</p>
<p t="7805440" d="4279">That that has to be looked at because that&#39;s the pathway to salvation</p>
<p t="7810239" d="4490">Roughly speaking. It&#39;s exactly the same idea. It&#39;s the worst thing that can possibly happen</p>
<p t="7815820" d="5000">So you look upon it and meditate upon it, and that&#39;s the key to transcending it well</p>
<p t="7820820" d="2310">So that&#39;s the idea that&#39;s encapsulated in that image</p>
<p t="7823710" d="6199">So it&#39;s you know. It&#39;s no wonder that these ideas had to be expressed in images because they&#39;re so unbelievably</p>
<p t="7830730" d="2000">Complicated that they&#39;re almost incomprehensible</p>
<p t="7833400" d="5390">So they come out first in the image they come out first in the story because they&#39;re just and plus</p>
<p t="7838790" d="1449">They&#39;re so difficult to believe</p>
<p t="7840239" d="6500">What the last thing you would think if you were being bitten by poisonous snakes was that you should make a bronze image of one</p>
<p t="7846739" d="2250">And put it on a stick so that you could go look at it</p>
<p t="7848989" d="3450">I mean, there&#39;s a magical element to that, but it&#39;s psycho therapeutically</p>
<p t="7853679" d="681">exactly, right</p>
<p t="7854360" d="1780">so I had this client and</p>
<p t="7856140" d="5479">She had a dream about what what she was she was having a really rough time, and she she was a pretty good dreamer.</p>
<p t="7862250" d="4770">She had this dream that she was walking down a road by there was a ocean on one side</p>
<p t="7867020" d="2609">and there was a sort of sand dunes on the other side and</p>
<p t="7870270" d="3649">She looked up, and there&#39;s this guy with a huge python</p>
<p t="7874680" d="3409">that had that had been out there showing it to everyone and</p>
<p t="7878790" d="5479">she took a look and he invited her to come take a look at the snake, but she refused and walked on and</p>
<p t="7884790" d="5120">So she told me that dream. She was also quite imaginative, so I said look let&#39;s let&#39;s try something</p>
<p t="7891960" d="5510">First of all tell me about the snake handler, and she said well. He&#39;s kind of a Charlatan. He&#39;s a show-off</p>
<p t="7897470" d="5129">he&#39;s a he&#39;s a fake and I&#39;m afraid that if I went up to the crowd and</p>
<p t="7902940" d="4040">Where the snake was that they would force me to touch it and so I thought okay?</p>
<p t="7906980" d="2879">So that&#39;s why you walked by I said okay, so let&#39;s play a game. So you</p>
<p t="7910710" d="4069">Sit there and bring that dream image to mind close your eyes bring the dream image to mind</p>
<p t="7914780" d="5430">But let&#39;s play with a little bit like Jung&#39;s technique of active imagination. Let&#39;s play with it a little bit so go up</p>
<p t="7920210" d="4859">There you know imagine that you go up there, and you kind of have to do this like you&#39;re daydreaming</p>
<p t="7925320" d="4400">You know you can&#39;t force it. You have to play with it like you would when you&#39;re daydreaming</p>
<p t="7929760" d="3020">Which is you&#39;re kind of half doing it voluntarily and it&#39;s half</p>
<p t="7933600" d="5540">Manifesting itself. It&#39;s kind of a gateway between you and the collective unconscious. That&#39;s another way of thinking about it and</p>
<p t="7940080" d="4100">Anyways, I said okay, so go up there and the first thing we&#39;re going to do is figure out</p>
<p t="7944180" d="4439">What are you going to do if the crowd tells you that you have to touch the snake or get close to it?</p>
<p t="7949080" d="3979">Because she needed a defense because it isn&#39;t up to other people to force her to do that</p>
<p t="7953060" d="4109">So we we practiced what she might say like no, I&#39;m I&#39;m comfortable here</p>
<p t="7957170" d="3240">I&#39;m just going to stand in the background. Just going to look at it and get accustomed to it</p>
<p t="7960410" d="3209">I don&#39;t need you to push me forward so she felt pretty good about that</p>
<p t="7963620" d="2040">So I kind of armed her with a defense</p>
<p t="7965660" d="850">so then she could</p>
<p t="7966510" d="2900">Pretend to go up and take a look at the snake and I said well the first thing</p>
<p t="7969410" d="5729">You should do is take a look at the snake handler and see if he&#39;s who you think he is and so she did that?</p>
<p t="7975140" d="3419">In her imagination she said no, he doesn&#39;t seem to be the Charlatan at all</p>
<p t="7978560" d="5069">He&#39;s got this snake that is his you know something he takes care of and he just has come out here to show</p>
<p t="7984030" d="4040">The people and let people look at the snake and so she said yes</p>
<p t="7988070" d="7709">I said was he someone that you could trust or someone you shouldn&#39;t trust you have to ask both those questions because otherwise you&#39;re leading</p>
<p t="7996100" d="4589">Witness right you don&#39;t want to tell people what to think you have to let them figure it out for themselves</p>
<p t="8001480" d="4070">So and she said no, I think he&#39;s somebody that should be trusted, and I said, okay well</p>
<p t="8005550" d="520">so</p>
<p t="8006070" d="4939">what do you think that you could go up there and and and you know maybe lay your hands on the snake and touch the</p>
<p t="8011010" d="4799">Snake and she said she wasn&#39;t sure about it, but we went through it and she was able to do it and so</p>
<p t="8016420" d="2000">It&#39;s the same</p>
<p t="8018640" d="3859">So she had to she had to make contact she had to voluntarily make</p>
<p t="8022630" d="6470">Contact with with the this terrible snake that&#39;s at the bottom of being that&#39;s at the bottom of the tree of existence</p>
<p t="8029560" d="2479">Right that&#39;s where the snake is it&#39;s wrapped around the tree</p>
<p t="8032050" d="6829">Well, why well partly because we lived in trees, and that&#39;s where the damn snakes were down there on the ground where we didn&#39;t know</p>
<p t="8039520" d="3680">Right and that&#39;s the divine tree of being that and so</p>
<p t="8043780" d="2149">Well you have to get the hell out of the tree and go</p>
<p t="8046420" d="6320">Confront the snakes and then that&#39;s the that&#39;s the way out at least in principle. So that&#39;s kind of what that means</p>
<p t="8053380" d="2000">um</p>
<p t="8057130" d="2660">Show you here&#39;s another image of the same thing</p>
<p t="8062380" d="4010">what I like about this you see the fact that the</p>
<p t="8066970" d="4759">culture the Patriarchy God the father will say here is holding the</p>
<p t="8072340" d="7819">Suffering individual in his arms, and that&#39;s encapsulated by nature it&#39;s it&#39;s very much like the story in Pinocchio, where Geppetto</p>
<p t="8080680" d="2000">Pinocchio wasn&#39;t able to go down</p>
<p t="8082690" d="6470">Into the depths and confront the terrible monster at the bottom of being without having support from his father even though his father ended up</p>
<p t="8089160" d="4770">Trapped inside the whale if he wouldn&#39;t have been supported to begin with he wouldn&#39;t have been able to do it</p>
<p t="8093930" d="3000">And you know I&#39;ve really seen this and I really seen this in people</p>
<p t="8096930" d="5219">It&#39;s a hell of a thing not to have the confidence of your father. It&#39;s really really hard on people</p>
<p t="8102190" d="5180">You know if your father is someone who says to you you can do it. I really believe that you can do it</p>
<p t="8107370" d="1230">I&#39;ll support you in what you&#39;re doing</p>
<p t="8108600" d="3750">I think that you can sort it out and then acts towards you in that way</p>
<p t="8112350" d="4290">That&#39;s a gift that really almost no one else can provide you with mothers obviously provide</p>
<p t="8116640" d="5399">I think they provide the same kind of gift but earlier you know because the mother has to take care of the infant when the</p>
<p t="8122040" d="6209">Infant has just completely dependent and so and this is Erickson&#39;s idea too Eric Erickson is the mother is is</p>
<p t="8128710" d="6919">The person establishes the relationship that allows the developing person to manifest trust real trust while you&#39;re being</p>
<p t="8135790" d="1280">carried for crying out loud</p>
<p t="8137070" d="3479">You know you can be dropped and the mother is also the source of food</p>
<p t="8140590" d="3410">But the father seems to be something like the and I&#39;m being</p>
<p t="8144340" d="3770">I&#39;m obviously parsing these things farther apart than they can be need to be because</p>
<p t="8148239" d="3560">The Father can play a nurturing role and the mother can play an encouraging role</p>
<p t="8151800" d="5820">But we&#39;ll keep it simple for now the father seems to be the thing that supports and encourages it says well</p>
<p t="8157620" d="1920">Yeah, you know your little as small and all of that</p>
<p t="8159540" d="6810">And you&#39;re subject to destruction and and and bullying and social pressure and all that but I know you can do it</p>
<p t="8166350" d="2819">I know you can do it and there&#39;s a force in that that&#39;s</p>
<p t="8169449" d="3080">Unbelievable and people who don&#39;t have that have a have a hell of a time</p>
<p t="8172690" d="6680">It&#39;s actually one of the things that&#39;s quite fun about doing psychotherapy because you get people who have damaged father figures</p>
<p t="8179370" d="1810">It&#39;s harder with the damaged mother</p>
<p t="8181180" d="5959">Figure a because it&#39;s so bloody deep you know I had a client who I just I just thought she was a remarkable person</p>
<p t="8187449" d="2720">But her relationship with her mother was really disrupted</p>
<p t="8190170" d="1660">It was really really hard to</p>
<p t="8191830" d="1559">she says she would she</p>
<p t="8193389" d="4010">Told me it was like something had been torn out of her at an early age that couldn&#39;t be replaced</p>
<p t="8197400" d="4199">It&#39;s real because he just can&#39;t be someone&#39;s mother you know it&#39;s really hard</p>
<p t="8202030" d="4969">you&#39;re just not there enough for that, but you can sort of be someone&#39;s surrogate father that&#39;s a</p>
<p t="8207519" d="4340">That&#39;s a role. You can play later, and that&#39;s what educators do at least to some degree although now</p>
<p t="8211860" d="2939">They&#39;re trying to be mothers and providing safe spaces and all of that</p>
<p t="8214800" d="1990">Which is not really all that appropriate</p>
<p t="8216790" d="6889">so that so the father is an encouraging figure and allows the individual at least in principle to support the</p>
<p t="8223929" d="1531">Catastrophe of being</p>
<p t="8225460" d="2000">Voluntarily and so</p>
<p t="8228160" d="5779">Anyway, so those you know those images are just be a brilliant beyond belief absolutely brilliant beyond belief</p>
<p t="8235059" d="2570">ok well, that&#39;s probably a good place to stop and</p>
<p t="8238210" d="1050">so</p>
<p t="8239260" d="5660">So we&#39;ve got through the the two front these two fundamental stories remember in the Egyptian story</p>
<p t="8245320" d="2089">you have much more development of the figure of</p>
<p t="8247840" d="6589">Osiris whose equivalent to Apsu and the Egyptians sort of walked through how this state becomes corrupt and</p>
<p t="8254620" d="5780">deteriorates and what the individual has to do in relationship to the state as well as in relationship to the</p>
<p t="8260889" d="3201">Chaos itself, so in the mesopotamians story. It&#39;s mostly</p>
<p t="8265000" d="1860">Apsu&#39;s dead and</p>
<p t="8266860" d="3950">Marduk makes a new society out of the pieces, but it&#39;s pretty damn implicit</p>
<p t="8270810" d="5519">You know it&#39;s not detailed whereas by the time the Egyptians come along they say well. Osiris was great</p>
<p t="8276430" d="5149">He&#39;s corrupted by Seth he has an evil brother. So that&#39;s the tyrannical element of the state</p>
<p t="8281591" d="5239">He&#39;s overcome by the evil brother. Which is the tendency of every bureaucratic system everywhere.</p>
<p t="8287500" d="5840">Things fall apart chaos comes back up the hero is born takes on the corruption of the state and</p>
<p t="8293650" d="6139">Goes into the underworld which is like confronting Tiamat, but there I like to have the stories in parallel because one of it is</p>
<p t="8299790" d="7350">The confrontation with absolute unknown Tiamat and the other is the revivification of the state even though the stories also overlap and so</p>
<p t="8307510" d="2000">in the Egyptian story</p>
<p t="8309850" d="2000">the and so just like Marduk was</p>
<p t="8312310" d="7790">the the model for the Emperor the combination of Osiris and Horus was the model for the pharaoh and then there was an</p>
<p t="8320100" d="7799">Idea that emerged out of Egypt this was called the democratization of Osiris, and it&#39;s I think part of what gave rise to the entire</p>
<p t="8328420" d="3080">Judeo-Christian idea set of ideas because the Jews</p>
<p t="8332051" d="5269">Hypothetically came out of Egypt right so their thinking is very deeply influenced by Egyptian ideas</p>
<p t="8338410" d="1440">the Pharaoh</p>
<p t="8339850" d="5569">Was the amalgam of Osiris and Horus and the amalgam of Osiris and Horus was his</p>
<p t="8345670" d="6050">Immortal soul the pharaohs immortal soul and the Pharaoh was allowed to use the symbolism of the conjunction of Osiris and Horus</p>
<p t="8351970" d="5179">But as the Egyptian societies developed the aristocracy started to get to use that symbol</p>
<p t="8357700" d="6589">So it started moving down the hierarchy the idea that it wasn&#39;t only that the pharaoh was Osiris and Horus</p>
<p t="8364690" d="5000">It was been it with the aristocracy and then by the time the Greeks came along it was all</p>
<p t="8369820" d="2570">Men who were part of the political structure and</p>
<p t="8372610" d="7129">Then by the time the Christians came along it was no no wait a minute this applies to everyone men women and not only</p>
<p t="8380230" d="3259">male and female alike, but also not just</p>
<p t="8384490" d="5270">stalwart upholders of the State but criminals, tax collectors, prostitutes,</p>
<p t="8390521" d="2000">outcasts, everyone had this</p>
<p t="8393011" d="6139">Osiris/Horus soul inside of them and were entitled to be treated as</p>
<p t="8400240" d="6229">If they were intrinsically valuable as a consequence of that, and that&#39;s the bedrock as far as I&#39;m concerned</p>
<p t="8406470" d="3270">That&#39;s the bedrock idea upon which western civilization is predicated</p>
<p t="8409870" d="5750">It&#39;s the sovereignty of the individual and the individual sovereign. Why?</p>
<p t="8415990" d="2599">The individual is the eye that&#39;s up above the pyramid.</p>
<p t="8418870" d="6559">The individual is the thing that can dominate sets of dominance hierarchies. The individual is the thing that play is not the game</p>
<p t="8425430" d="1420">but the metagame.</p>
<p t="8426850" d="6260">The individual is the thing that revivify the dead culture. The individuals the thing that that goes out to</p>
<p t="8433630" d="6589">combat chaos and generate something valuable as a consequence, and that&#39;s why it&#39;s sovereign and valuable. That&#39;s the</p>
<p t="8440860" d="3349">foundation of our legal system and our culture, so</p>
<p t="8445030" d="2000">so think about it as the</p>
<p t="8447430" d="6080">Emergence as an emergent property of enlightenment ideals is dangerous because that&#39;s four hundred years</p>
<p t="8454030" d="2000">Who cares about four hundred years?</p>
<p t="8456130" d="7099">This is forever and forever is a lot more firm grounding than four hundred years. It&#39;s not a set of rational ideas</p>
<p t="8463270" d="2419">It&#39;s way way deeper than that</p>
<p t="8466540" d="1860">so</p>
<p t="8468400" d="2000">Okay</p>
<p t="8470950" d="2419">Good enough. We&#39;ll see you in a week</p>
