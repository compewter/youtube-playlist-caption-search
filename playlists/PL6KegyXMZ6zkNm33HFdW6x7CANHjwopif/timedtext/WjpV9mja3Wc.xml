<p t="3050" d="6580">Okay, so we’re actually going to take a
step back historically.</p>
<p t="9630" d="6399">We talked about Carl Rogers last time as a
phenomenologist.</p>
<p t="16029" d="5160">So we started our brief foray into the ideas
behind phenomenology, but now we’re going</p>
<p t="21189" d="4920">to go back in time a bit and we’re going
to talk about the end of the 19th century,</p>
<p t="26109" d="7301">and we’re gonna discuss Nietzsche, and Dostoevsky,
and Kierkegaard in some detail, and the reason</p>
<p t="33410" d="5030">we’re going to do that is because those
three men - I would say more than anyone else</p>
<p t="38440" d="5619">in the 19th century - laid the groundwork
not only for what would become psychoanalysis</p>
<p t="44059" d="6451">and then later personality psychology and
clinical psychology, but they also described</p>
<p t="50510" d="7340">the broader social, political, and cultural
situation that modern people find themselves</p>
<p t="57850" d="8700">in now, and their thought is exceedingly sophisticated
and it’s really worth grasping because if</p>
<p t="66550" d="5720">you can get - you know we’re going through
these personality theories one at a time,</p>
<p t="72270" d="7800">and we’re making forays into biology and
neuropsychology, you need a structure underneath</p>
<p t="80070" d="1000">that.</p>
<p t="81070" d="3400">You need to understand a structure underneath
all that to slot in everything into because</p>
<p t="84470" d="7320">that way you can understand it in more detail,
and so, partly because ideas develop historically,</p>
<p t="91790" d="6080">you know, so an idea’s a seed and out of
the seed, other plants grow and so forth,</p>
<p t="97870" d="2630">and the plant grows and so farth and branches
off.</p>
<p t="100500" d="5450">If you can get back down to the origin point,
then you can often understand the entire structure</p>
<p t="105950" d="8530">more straightforwardly, and also these three
men, they&#39;re so brilliant that it’s a joy</p>
<p t="114480" d="6950">to encounter their thinking even though it’s
very, very subversive - seriously subversive.</p>
<p t="121430" d="7680">So, we’re gonna start with this diagram
which you’ll remember.</p>
<p t="129110" d="4910">Okay so think about this from the Piagetian
perspective, like we made the point that as</p>
<p t="134020" d="8730">the child points itself, let’s say, together,
it starts by practicing micro routines - micro</p>
<p t="142750" d="4910">motor routines - and those are accompanied
by perceptual frameworks and also they&#39;re</p>
<p t="147660" d="6400">incorporated into a motivational value system
because they’re motivated actions, and then</p>
<p t="154060" d="5860">the child practices sequencing those micro
personalities, we’ll say, together to make</p>
<p t="159920" d="4430">ever more and more complex and ever more and
more integrated macro personalities.</p>
<p t="164350" d="4640">So that’s basically what this diagram describes.</p>
<p t="168990" d="6540">We were looking at it from an adult perspective
so, you know, if you&#39;re going to be a good</p>
<p t="175530" d="5260">person, you can decompose being a good person
into sub parts of being a good person, and</p>
<p t="180790" d="6840">- so being a good person is an abstract ideal,
but as you move closer and closer to the point</p>
<p t="187630" d="5380">where goodness is manifested in action, you
move closer and closer to actual movements</p>
<p t="193010" d="1460">in the world.</p>
<p t="194470" d="4700">So the abstract category, good person, is
actually made out of you can think about it</p>
<p t="199170" d="6820">as a very complex melody of motor actions
and perceptions, and perception is very tightly</p>
<p t="205990" d="3570">linked to motor action because whenever you
perceive anything, you&#39;re doing it in part</p>
<p t="209560" d="1900">by actively investigating the world.</p>
<p t="211460" d="3140">It’s partly why your eyes are moving around
all the time, and if you&#39;re listening you</p>
<p t="214600" d="4290">move your head, and you know, to touch something
you have to actively investigate it so it’s</p>
<p t="218890" d="3000">always an activity of exploration.</p>
<p t="221890" d="8360">Now, in some ways when you think about the
child piecing its being together from the</p>
<p t="230250" d="6430">bottom up, you can think about that as a biological
process unfolding, you know, and you can think</p>
<p t="236680" d="4020">of the child as crawling and then learning
to walk as a biological process unfolding,</p>
<p t="240700" d="6290">but that’s an oversimplification because
human beings exist from day one in a very,</p>
<p t="246990" d="1900">very social world.</p>
<p t="248890" d="6819">And so what that means is the way that those
behaviors or micro personalities start to</p>
<p t="255709" d="7240">organize themselves is always under the influence
of the society in which they&#39;re embedded,</p>
<p t="262949" d="11351">and so you know, Piaget talked about the child
as being - as having reflex, basic built in</p>
<p t="274300" d="6440">reflexes at birth, and that those reflexes
are then elaborated up into more and more</p>
<p t="280740" d="3819">complex structures, but you can think that
even the elaboration of those basic reflexes,</p>
<p t="284559" d="4350">even right from the beginning, like there&#39;s
a rooting and sucking reflex which you can</p>
<p t="288909" d="4060">elicit from a child by tapping on the side
of its cheek when it’s very newly born,</p>
<p t="292969" d="6721">and it’ll start to try to put what&#39;s tapping
in its mouth, and that&#39;s part of the reflexive</p>
<p t="299690" d="6229">process, the built in perceptual motor unit
that allows the child to begin to suckle.</p>
<p t="305919" d="5231">Now the thing is though, what it’s suckling
isn&#39;t a static and objective entity.</p>
<p t="311150" d="5239">It’s a person, and part of breast feeding
is the establishment of a relationship, a</p>
<p t="316389" d="2671">complex relationship because it’s also not
only a feeding relationship.</p>
<p t="319060" d="1389">It’s a caring relationship.</p>
<p t="320449" d="4140">It’s a relationship that&#39;s based on tactile
interaction.</p>
<p t="324589" d="5540">There could be nervousness associated with
it, and often is especially for a new mother.</p>
<p t="330129" d="4780">It’s a very complex dynamic social act,
and so what that means is that right from</p>
<p t="334909" d="7741">the beginning, in order for the baby to engage
in that process properly, it has to allow</p>
<p t="342650" d="6910">its initial reflexive movements to be modified
by social necessity immediately.</p>
<p t="349560" d="6240">So for example, if a baby is breastfeeding,
it can&#39;t bite, and you know it doesn&#39;t have</p>
<p t="355800" d="5019">any teeth so being bitten isn&#39;t necessarily
a catastrophe, but it’s not pleasant.</p>
<p t="360819" d="3710">So what will happen if the baby bites the
mother is that the mother will pull away and</p>
<p t="364529" d="7021">startle the baby, and the baby will cry and
you know, the mother will be at least startled</p>
<p t="371550" d="1109">by the error.</p>
<p t="372659" d="6380">So the baby has to learn to - it has to learn
to be civilized in some sense right off the</p>
<p t="379039" d="1000">bat.</p>
<p t="380039" d="4400">Now you know, when Freud was talking about
the process of socialization, he tended to</p>
<p t="384439" d="4230">concentrate more on toilet training, you know,
because he thought of that as the first place</p>
<p t="388669" d="5970">where the - the first major place where the
id of the child, which Rogers would regard</p>
<p t="394639" d="9340">as an organismic, as the organismic experiential
domain is brought under control of the superego,</p>
<p t="403979" d="6440">right, because the baby, obviously its fundamental,
biological function is to relieve itself,</p>
<p t="410419" d="5470">but that has to come under very very strict
social control, and it’s a complex form</p>
<p t="415889" d="1000">of learning, you know.</p>
<p t="416889" d="5430">It’s basically the acquisition of all voluntary
control over what was here before an involuntary</p>
<p t="422319" d="6330">reflex essentially, and so that can go well
or it can go badly and it can go very badly.</p>
<p t="428649" d="5570">So I knew a family who had a daughter at one
point, and that daughter would only defecate</p>
<p t="434219" d="2431">in her diaper when she was three.</p>
<p t="436650" d="4319">So that meant she had full, voluntary control
over her bowel function but there was no way</p>
<p t="440969" d="5730">she was going to participate in the social
ritual that surrounded proper toileting.</p>
<p t="446699" d="4951">There was a war going on, like a serious war,
and that sort of thing happens well not infrequently,</p>
<p t="451650" d="6639">and of course you remember in the Crumb movie,
the mother - the boy is accusing the mother</p>
<p t="458289" d="4641">of giving them enemas and her, of course,
denying that any such thing happened which</p>
<p t="462930" d="4000">was something that made both of them roll
their eyes, and you know, they all laugh but</p>
<p t="466930" d="2549">it’s really not particularly amusing.</p>
<p t="469479" d="7670">So, anyways my point is is that even at the
micro level, the manifestation of what we’ll</p>
<p t="477149" d="5760">call micro personalities expands and organizes
into an environment that’s conditioned by</p>
<p t="482909" d="1671">social expectation.</p>
<p t="484580" d="7269">Okay, so then - then, and this is something
we haven&#39;t talked about before.</p>
<p t="491849" d="5570">One thing you might ask is okay where does
the social expectation come from?</p>
<p t="497419" d="5041">Now, that&#39;s a very complex question because
in some sense, that&#39;s the same question as</p>
<p t="502460" d="5150">where does culture come from, and that&#39;s partly
a complex question because you have to take</p>
<p t="507610" d="6640">into account evolutionary history which provides
the substrata for the development of culture,</p>
<p t="514250" d="1000">so that would be human biology.</p>
<p t="515250" d="4329">You&#39;d have to take that into account, and
then you have to take human history into account,</p>
<p t="519579" d="5361">and what you don&#39;t have to take into account
is not clear, right, because it’s very difficult</p>
<p t="524940" d="7250">to track the origins of the social routines
that make up the fundamental social contract,</p>
<p t="532190" d="1000">you know.</p>
<p t="533190" d="2610">We know how to behave properly, roughly speaking.</p>
<p t="535800" d="4980">We have a set of expectations, and a set of
wants about the way that other people are</p>
<p t="540780" d="5020">going to behave with regards to us, and they
return the favor, and everyone is participating</p>
<p t="545800" d="3831">in this, and everybody basically knows it
nless they&#39;re very poorly socialized and you</p>
<p t="549631" d="1878">can usually tell that right away.</p>
<p t="551509" d="4101">You know, kids can tell that because if a
three year old is playing with another three</p>
<p t="555610" d="4409">year old, and one of them is poorly socialized
and so maybe has the behavioral repertoire</p>
<p t="560019" d="5111">of a fairly badly behaved two year old, the
other three year old, being socially sophisticated</p>
<p t="565130" d="2759">will, say, will not play with the first one.</p>
<p t="567889" d="5381">So, even though they might be perfectly happy
to play for a time with an actual two year</p>
<p t="573270" d="1000">old.</p>
<p t="574270" d="1860">So, it doesn&#39;t take very long.</p>
<p t="576130" d="4620">It’s really at about the age of three that
children are already sophisticated enough</p>
<p t="580750" d="6730">to have embodied the rules that constitute
appropriate cultural behavior, and those rules</p>
<p t="587480" d="3870">- or they&#39;re patterns exactly for the, they&#39;re
not exactly rules for the child because the</p>
<p t="591350" d="4450">child couldn&#39;t explicitly state them, but
they can act them out.</p>
<p t="595800" d="4610">Now you remember, now Piaget talked about
this a fair bit right, because he said that</p>
<p t="600410" d="8669">part of the way that the slightly larger micro
personalities, say of a two year old, are</p>
<p t="609079" d="5021">integrated into the broader social world is
through games that are played with peers and</p>
<p t="614100" d="6690">with older children, and the games are ways
that - like a game is fundamentally a negotiated...it’s</p>
<p t="620790" d="7210">a negotiated sphere of action and perception
that has a particular goal and the goal is</p>
<p t="628000" d="4690">defined by the players, and the sphere of
interaction is defined by the players and</p>
<p t="632690" d="4190">so then if you&#39;re a good player, what happens
is that you become part of a higher order</p>
<p t="636880" d="3019">structure and the higher order structure is
the game.</p>
<p t="639899" d="4431">So if you&#39;re playing soccer, all of a sudden
if you&#39;re civilized, what you do is you manifest</p>
<p t="644330" d="6090">all those behaviors that are appropriate for
playing soccer, and you subordinate - voluntarily</p>
<p t="650420" d="5000">- subordinate your individuality at that point
to the higher order structure of the game</p>
<p t="655420" d="3770">that&#39;s a communal agreement, so it’s a basic
social contract.</p>
<p t="659190" d="5449">So you practice being part of basic social
contract by playing games, and you can do</p>
<p t="664639" d="8021">that with games that are in some sense relatively
straightforward and regulated by strict conventions</p>
<p t="672660" d="5130">and articulated rules, so that’d be like
a soccer game, or you can do it in a more</p>
<p t="677790" d="9130">complex way and a less structured and less
articulated manner by engaging in dramatic</p>
<p t="686920" d="1000">play.</p>
<p t="687920" d="3620">So what children usually do when they&#39;re doing
is that they&#39;ll gather around a little group</p>
<p t="691540" d="6120">and they&#39;ll lay out the drama so the drama
would be “We’re going to simulate x.</p>
<p t="697660" d="3739">We’re going to simulate a family.”</p>
<p t="701399" d="4332">And then everybody is assigned a role, and
so you&#39;re supposed to act out your role, but</p>
<p t="705731" d="4739">exactly how you&#39;re supposed to act it out
is left open during the game, so you can riff</p>
<p t="710470" d="6729">and improvise, and basically what children
are doing when they&#39;re doing that is acting</p>
<p t="717199" d="5201">out the family because, you know, they need
to get the family in their bones because being</p>
<p t="722400" d="5160">a parent isn&#39;t a set of ideas about parenting,
it’s a set of behaviors.</p>
<p t="727560" d="5360">It’s a dance that you learn to have with
your children and with your partner, and it’s</p>
<p t="732920" d="5229">very complicated, and the rules go far beyond
what you could ever articulate, you know,</p>
<p t="738149" d="3731">cause you can ask yourself a question like,
“Well how should you discipline a child?”</p>
<p t="741880" d="5189">Well first of all, you can argue about that
forever, but second of all, you cannot actually</p>
<p t="747069" d="5671">elaborate a set of principles that will guide
your behavior in every situation where a child</p>
<p t="752740" d="3329">is likely to disrupt the social circumstance.</p>
<p t="756069" d="4250">So you have to be smarter than you can say
in order to be good at doing something as</p>
<p t="760319" d="4750">complicated as discipling a child, you know,
because discipline also means encouraging,</p>
<p t="765069" d="4200">right, because part of discipline is well
you shouldn&#39;t do those things, but another</p>
<p t="769269" d="5121">part of it is you should definitely do more
of those things, and so it’s the inculcation</p>
<p t="774390" d="5929">of a moral code, and a lot of that is done
through nonverbal behavior and through providing</p>
<p t="780319" d="6981">a role model through spontaneous imitation,
and all sorts of things that aren&#39;t verbal.</p>
<p t="787300" d="7339">Okay now, so Piaget talked about the game,
and then you could think that games become</p>
<p t="794639" d="5680">more and more complex and more and more abstract
and more and more like real life as you mature</p>
<p t="800319" d="6101">until they maybe the games transform into
what sociologists would refer to as roles.</p>
<p t="806420" d="5469">So the role you&#39;re playing at the moment,
at least in principle, is student, and you</p>
<p t="811889" d="4671">know, it’s a game and it’s a game because
it’s a fiction in some sense.</p>
<p t="816560" d="3200">It’s a dramatic fiction in some sense.</p>
<p t="819760" d="5949">The only reason that it exists as a role is
because society is structured in such a way</p>
<p t="825709" d="5081">that enables this to - enables you to do what
you&#39;re doing and to live at the same time.</p>
<p t="830790" d="7770">So it’s not exactly adaptation to the natural
world, in any sense of the word, but it’s</p>
<p t="838560" d="5850">also real life or maybe it’s almost as close
to real life as you’d ever get because almost</p>
<p t="844410" d="4910">everything that modern people do, and maybe
this is true for a long time into the past,</p>
<p t="849320" d="2019">is game-like in its structure.</p>
<p t="851339" d="4131">So the games just get more and more and more
- they&#39;re more and more and more encompassing</p>
<p t="855470" d="6470">in some sense, but you can almost say that
it never comes to the point where what you&#39;re</p>
<p t="861940" d="2030">doing is no longer playing a game.</p>
<p t="863970" d="4640">Now that&#39;s a bit of an oversimplification
because there are games and metagames, but</p>
<p t="868610" d="3289">we won&#39;t talk about the metagames at the moment.</p>
<p t="871899" d="6151">Okay so now, you can understand some of the
lower order games, and you can even understand</p>
<p t="878050" d="4409">some of the higher order roles like you could
basically articulate in some sense what it</p>
<p t="882459" d="1661">means to be a student.</p>
<p t="884120" d="4469">But if you go up the hierarchy because you
know, good person - a subset of good person</p>
<p t="888589" d="1451">could be good student.</p>
<p t="890040" d="3899">You can kind of articulate what it means to
be a good student, although you can&#39;t fully</p>
<p t="893939" d="6700">articulate it, but if you go at levels above
that like be a good citizen or be a good person,</p>
<p t="900639" d="5151">it gets more and more difficult to fully articulate
because of course, it’s more and more abstract,</p>
<p t="905790" d="6109">and it encompasses more and more territory,
and so by the time you&#39;re at the top of the</p>
<p t="911899" d="2451">hierarchy so to speak, “be a good person.”</p>
<p t="914350" d="4760">Well, it’s a much more phenomena than you
can articulate.</p>
<p t="919110" d="1740">It can&#39;t be fully articulated.</p>
<p t="920850" d="7789">Now, I want to read you something that Nietzsche
said.</p>
<p t="928639" d="24331">Now you have to listen to this carefully because
there&#39;s some very interesting things about</p>
<p t="952970" d="1000">the way Nietzsche writes.</p>
<p t="953970" d="6219">He writes aphoristically, and an aphorism
is a short statement, often only a sentence</p>
<p t="960189" d="7900">but more typically a paragraph, that&#39;s very,
very densely packed with ideas, and I think</p>
<p t="968089" d="3490">you can say in some sense if you read Nietzsche
- and the stuff that I’m going to read from</p>
<p t="971579" d="4611">right now is from “Beyond Good and Evil”
- is that every single sentence has an idea</p>
<p t="976190" d="4459">in it, and it’s often an original idea,
and that&#39;s a remarkable accomplishment.</p>
<p t="980649" d="5130">I mean, I’ve often gone through books and
marked - I usually fold the top of the page</p>
<p t="985779" d="2841">over - and marked where I think there&#39;s an
idea worth keeping.</p>
<p t="988620" d="3980">It’s an idea I haven&#39;t run into before so
it’s an original idea.</p>
<p t="992600" d="4529">And I would say in the typical book I read,
there&#39;s none of them.</p>
<p t="997129" d="5710">There might be one or two, but with Nietzsche
there’s probably twenty on a page, and so</p>
<p t="1002839" d="6610">it makes it - he’s packed a tremendous amount
of information into a very, very small space</p>
<p t="1009449" d="3640">and he tried to do that and there&#39;s a bunch
of reasons.</p>
<p t="1013089" d="3750">One was, his health wasn&#39;t very good, although
he was an early age genius.</p>
<p t="1016839" d="4761">He was a full professor in Germany at - I
think when he was 22 or 23 which is impossible</p>
<p t="1021600" d="6920">because you don&#39;t become a full professor,
especially a hundred and thirty years ago,</p>
<p t="1028520" d="5590">a hundred forty years ago in a German university
at the age of 23, it just isn&#39;t impossible.</p>
<p t="1034110" d="4740">But he was a spectacular genius, but his health
failed him so he had a very difficult time</p>
<p t="1038850" d="5520">writing, and so what he did was spend an awful
lot of time thinking and a very short period</p>
<p t="1044370" d="4130">of time writing, and so what that meant was
that he would take a tremendous amount of</p>
<p t="1048500" d="4410">thought - genius level thought - and then
compress it into like a single sentence, or</p>
<p t="1052910" d="5300">a single paragraph, and he said that he liked
to philosophize with a hammer, and in some</p>
<p t="1058210" d="5710">sense - you know that hierarchy that I just
showed you, you know we talked about the idea</p>
<p t="1063920" d="7930">that if you hit something disruptive in your
life that the magnitude of your response is</p>
<p t="1071850" d="4130">proportionate to the elevation of the level
right.</p>
<p t="1075980" d="6020">It’s much more damaging to be accused of
being a bad person, you know seriously, than</p>
<p t="1082000" d="3690">it is for someone to complain about, you know,
on which side of the plate you happen to put</p>
<p t="1085690" d="2180">the fork on.</p>
<p t="1087870" d="6540">And I think you could say that you can sort
of think of those nested hierarchies of value</p>
<p t="1094410" d="4050">as nested hierarchies of - they&#39;re almost
like maps in a sense.</p>
<p t="1098460" d="6620">They&#39;re little units of ways that you know
how to maneuver in the world, and what that</p>
<p t="1105080" d="4990">means is that as you go up the hierarchy,
the map is larger and larger and more comprehensive,</p>
<p t="1110070" d="4920">and so if you blow up someone’s map of which
fork to put on the table, that&#39;s not so bad.</p>
<p t="1114990" d="2700">They can just rectify that in no time flat.</p>
<p t="1117690" d="4620">It leaves 99.99% of their personality intact.</p>
<p t="1122310" d="6680">But if you fail a crucial exam for example
and part of the reason that you&#39;re a student</p>
<p t="1128990" d="5320">is you want to go to medical school, that’ll
blow out like fifty or sixty percent of your</p>
<p t="1134310" d="3230">personality, or at least it’ll feel that
way, and that&#39;s because what&#39;s happening is</p>
<p t="1137540" d="5930">that the structure that you use to regulate
the relationship between you and the world</p>
<p t="1143470" d="5020">has become damaged at a high level, and that
invalidates - like if you&#39;re not a student.</p>
<p t="1148490" d="4710">If you&#39;re not a good student anymore, then
all of the subfactors that make up being a</p>
<p t="1153200" d="4510">good student might be invalid, and you know
you might have put a lot of effort into being</p>
<p t="1157710" d="4240">a good student, and so if all of a sudden
you&#39;re not that, you have to ask yourself,</p>
<p t="1161950" d="4420">well what exactly am I and where are all the
errors?</p>
<p t="1166370" d="7110">Well that&#39;s an extraordinarily difficult cognitive
problem because you&#39;ve built that structure,</p>
<p t="1173480" d="3450">who knows over what period of time.</p>
<p t="1176930" d="3830">It might be fifteen years or something like
that, and you&#39;ve been practicing building</p>
<p t="1180760" d="4360">that structure, and it’s a huge part of
your identity because someone might say well</p>
<p t="1185120" d="1440">what are you even?</p>
<p t="1186560" d="1460">And you say a student.</p>
<p t="1188020" d="3510">You know, they might say what do you do, but
they can easily say what are you?</p>
<p t="1191530" d="1000">I’m a student.</p>
<p t="1192530" d="6700">Well if you&#39;re not a student, at least insofar
as you define student, then just exactly what</p>
<p t="1199230" d="2570">are you?</p>
<p t="1201800" d="4910">Alright so Nietzsche, you know, when he packed
a lot of information into a sentence or a</p>
<p t="1206710" d="1850">paragraph, you have to be very careful reading
him.</p>
<p t="1208560" d="4350">Jung is like this too because he’ll throw
some information at you that&#39;s packed into</p>
<p t="1212910" d="4520">a paragraph and it’ll be the kind of information
that disrupts high level structures.</p>
<p t="1217430" d="4710">You won&#39;t even notice it, and that&#39;s because
it’s so subversive, and he wanted to do</p>
<p t="1222140" d="1000">it.</p>
<p t="1223140" d="1000">It was an aim of his.</p>
<p t="1224140" d="1270">He had his reasons to do it.</p>
<p t="1225410" d="4290">He would say that you have to be broken down
to nothing before you can be rebuilt.</p>
<p t="1229700" d="2850">So it’s like a trip to the underworld thing.</p>
<p t="1232550" d="4770">So, and I suppose that’s what philosophy
is.</p>
<p t="1237320" d="6960">You don&#39;t learn a new principle without allowing
old principles to disappear because you can&#39;t</p>
<p t="1244280" d="2810">have the new principle and the old principle
at the same time.</p>
<p t="1247090" d="6350">So almost always any radical learning involves
the destruction of old habits and actions</p>
<p t="1253440" d="8070">and perception, and that&#39;s a kind of death,
like it’s an abstract death, you know, but</p>
<p t="1261510" d="5300">that doesn&#39;t make it not painful, and the
thing is if the abstract death is of sufficient</p>
<p t="1266810" d="4760">intensity, it can drive people to suicide
because they regard killing themselves as</p>
<p t="1271570" d="6380">easier than making the reparation, you know,
facing the anxiety and the suffering and going</p>
<p t="1277950" d="2630">through the intolerably difficult task of
retooling.</p>
<p t="1280580" d="6570">They may well regard that as more emotionally
threatening than death, and so - and that&#39;s</p>
<p t="1287150" d="1000">not that rare.</p>
<p t="1288150" d="3640">I mean, suicide is rare, but it’s not that
rare.</p>
<p t="1291790" d="4500">So, you know and it’s certainly a behavior
that everyone is - I suspect - is everyone</p>
<p t="1296290" d="5400">here has known someone who was touched by
suicide in some way, you know.</p>
<p t="1301690" d="3840">It might not be your family member or even
your extended family member, but the probability</p>
<p t="1305530" d="4760">that you know someone who knows someone who
has committed suicide is extremely, extremely</p>
<p t="1310290" d="1000">likely.</p>
<p t="1311290" d="3940">So Nietzsche is a very dangerous, dangerous
thinker.</p>
<p t="1315230" d="5680">The only person I know who kind of approaches
him in that regard is Jung, and Jung is actually</p>
<p t="1320910" d="5730">less troublesome because a lot of what Dostoevsky
offers is destruction.</p>
<p t="1326640" d="6800">It’s intelligent, brilliant destruction,
but he doesn&#39;t really offer a solution.</p>
<p t="1333440" d="5020">He sort of sketches out the possibility of
a solution, and he died young, and then in</p>
<p t="1338460" d="4560">many ways what happened was that Jung picked
up where Nietzsche left off and tried to solve</p>
<p t="1343020" d="1760">the problems that Nietzsche left unsolved.</p>
<p t="1344780" d="5240">So it was Nietzsche for example - in some
sense along with Dostoevsky who really definitively</p>
<p t="1350020" d="5200">announced the death of God at the end of the
19th century, and that left people in some</p>
<p t="1355220" d="4460">ways bereft of belief, and we’re going to
talk about why that was so important in a</p>
<p t="1359680" d="1000">moment.</p>
<p t="1360680" d="4170">What Jung was doing was trying to - well he
was trying to rescue the father from the underworld</p>
<p t="1364850" d="1000">in a sense.</p>
<p t="1365850" d="5110">He was trying - he tried to go back to the
religious traditions that Nietzsche had described</p>
<p t="1370960" d="4080">as fatally anachronistic and demolished by
the claims of science.</p>
<p t="1375040" d="5280">He had attempted to go back to those religious
traditions and reassess them from a psychological</p>
<p t="1380320" d="5410">perspective to pull back the necessary meaning
that was embedded in them so that people could</p>
<p t="1385730" d="5430">reunite with their culture and in principle
not be so prone to pathological belief systems</p>
<p t="1391160" d="4450">like ideology that tend to rush in when there&#39;s
a gap.</p>
<p t="1395610" d="4720">And you know, Nietzsche said very clearly,
and Dostoevsky knew this as well by the end</p>
<p t="1400330" d="5871">of the 19th century, is that the death of
God would mean that people would turn en masse</p>
<p t="1406201" d="3459">to rationalistic ideologies and that would
be murderous.</p>
<p t="1409660" d="3040">They knew that was coming, and that’s an
amazing prediction.</p>
<p t="1412700" d="1920">It really is an amazing prediction.</p>
<p t="1414620" d="3110">It just shows you how thoroughly they understood
the structure.</p>
<p t="1417730" d="4230">Okay, so I’m going to read you something
by Nietzsche and we’re going to return to</p>
<p t="1421960" d="5190">the hierarchy so you can kind of understand
something deeper about the way the hierarchy</p>
<p t="1427150" d="1000">is structured.</p>
<p t="1428150" d="4800">Okay, now he&#39;s talking about philosophical
ideas here, and he’s actually talking about</p>
<p t="1432950" d="1880">articulated ethics.</p>
<p t="1434830" d="6630">So, one way that you might think about philosophy
is that philosophers originate articulated</p>
<p t="1441460" d="5370">moral principles, and that is often the way
that people think about especially moral philosophies.</p>
<p t="1446830" d="4560">It’s like it’s the philosophers who come
up with the ideas, but that isn&#39;t what Nietzsche</p>
<p t="1451390" d="1350">believed.</p>
<p t="1452740" d="2950">Here&#39;s what he said instead.</p>
<p t="1455690" d="9130">“Separate philosophical ideas are not anything
optional or autonomously evolving.</p>
<p t="1464820" d="5810">They grow up in connection and relationship
with each other however suddenly and arbitrarily</p>
<p t="1470630" d="5250">they seem to appear in the history of thought,
they nevertheless belong just as much to a</p>
<p t="1475880" d="4590">system as the collective members of the fauna
of a continent.”</p>
<p t="1480470" d="1930">Okay so, it’s a very interesting idea.</p>
<p t="1482400" d="4900">So the first idea that he’s putting forward
is that you could -- the best way to think</p>
<p t="1487300" d="7240">about a philosophical system, say a philosophical
system of ethics, is as if its different statements</p>
<p t="1494540" d="3870">are animals related to one another in an ecosystem.</p>
<p t="1498410" d="5830">So he has a biological metaphor, in some sense,
for the emergence of the philosophical system.</p>
<p t="1504240" d="5300">It’s quite an interesting way of thinking,
of course, and it makes sense because if a</p>
<p t="1509540" d="4430">philosophical system of ethics - which is
a philosophical system that tells you how</p>
<p t="1513970" d="5620">and why you should behave a certain way - is
about how you should act and you&#39;re a biological</p>
<p t="1519590" d="4550">being, then of course it only makes sense
that the concepts themselves which are guides</p>
<p t="1524140" d="6660">to actions can logically be considered biological
entities.</p>
<p t="1530800" d="4320">They&#39;re abstracted biological entities but
they still have the same nature as biological</p>
<p t="1535120" d="4260">entities, and that means, according to Nietzsche,
that they&#39;re subject to the same rules.</p>
<p t="1539380" d="5000">Now this is the sort of place where he foreshadows
Freud deeply.</p>
<p t="1544380" d="7980">So Nietzsche says, “They nevertheless belong
just as much to a system as the collective</p>
<p t="1552360" d="2730">members of the fauna of a continent.</p>
<p t="1555090" d="6860">This is betrayed in the end by the circumstance;
however, unfailingly the most diverse philosophers</p>
<p t="1561950" d="6700">always fill in, again, a definite fundamental
scheme of possible philosophies.</p>
<p t="1568650" d="5060">Under an invisible spell, they always resolve
once more in the same orbit however independent</p>
<p t="1573710" d="4480">of each other they may feel themselves with
their critical or systematic wills.</p>
<p t="1578190" d="2040">Something within them leads them.</p>
<p t="1580230" d="5320">Something impels them in definite order, the
one after the other, to wit the innate methodology</p>
<p t="1585550" d="3030">and relationship of their ideas.</p>
<p t="1588580" d="7040">Their thinking is, in fact, far less a discovery
than a re-recognizing, a remembering, a return,</p>
<p t="1595620" d="5610">and a homecoming to a far off ancient common
household of the soul out of which these ideas</p>
<p t="1601230" d="1850">formerly grew.</p>
<p t="1603080" d="3870">Philosophizing is so far a kind of atavism
of the highest order.”</p>
<p t="1606950" d="4620">Okay so, here’s the idea.</p>
<p t="1611570" d="8590">There&#39;s two fundamental ideas that are embedded
in this which actually Nietzsche differentiates.</p>
<p t="1620160" d="18800">Alright I’m gonna read you another section
that illuminates the first one.</p>
<p t="1638960" d="5900">“It has gradually become clear to me what
every great philosophy up till now has consisted</p>
<p t="1644860" d="7160">of – namely, the confession of its originator,
and a species of involuntary and unconscious</p>
<p t="1652020" d="5570">autobiography; and moreover that the moral
(or immoral) purpose in every philosophy has</p>
<p t="1657590" d="4410">constituted the true vital germ out of which
the entire plant has always grown.”</p>
<p t="1662000" d="4180">Okay so this is a very radical statement because
what Nietzsche is saying is that philosophies,</p>
<p t="1666180" d="7090">even when they declare themselves rational,
are deeply personal, and they&#39;re also necessarily</p>
<p t="1673270" d="5450">embedded within a motivational structure that
is either pro-life or anti-life, something</p>
<p t="1678720" d="1140">like that.</p>
<p t="1679860" d="3440">So there&#39;s no value free philosophizing.</p>
<p t="1683300" d="6170">What there is is the expression of biologically
and culturally conditioned being, which is</p>
<p t="1689470" d="4780">conditioned by, let’s say the same sort
of fundamental forces that Freud described</p>
<p t="1694250" d="5960">in the biological realm, and then that’s
conditioned by the cultural processes that</p>
<p t="1700210" d="5140">we just described in relationship to Piaget,
and then what the philosopher does is observe</p>
<p t="1705350" d="6450">that all of those things are happening, allow
that to be articulated, and confuse that with</p>
<p t="1711800" d="1490">his own thought.</p>
<p t="1713290" d="2030">It’s a brilliant idea.</p>
<p t="1715320" d="1890">Now here&#39;s a way of thinking about it.</p>
<p t="1717210" d="5551">Now, one of the things Piaget said was that
once children start to play games - when they&#39;re</p>
<p t="1722761" d="5329">young - collective games, you can watch the
children play the collective games, maybe</p>
<p t="1728090" d="4440">like eight kids are playing marbles or something
like that, and then you can take the young</p>
<p t="1732530" d="4990">kids out of the game and you can ask them
what the rules are, and what’ll happen is</p>
<p t="1737520" d="7550">you’ll get a diverse set - a diverse and
paradoxical set - of articulated rules, and</p>
<p t="1745070" d="4530">what that means is that the children can play
the game when they&#39;re in the game and when</p>
<p t="1749600" d="4880">they&#39;re in the context of all the other people
because in some sense, the game is embedded</p>
<p t="1754480" d="3700">in pieces in all of them, and as long as they&#39;re
all there, that all works, but if you pull</p>
<p t="1758180" d="6760">the child away they don&#39;t have the intellectual
wherewithal to describe the patterns of behavior</p>
<p t="1764940" d="4170">that make up the game, and that&#39;s only to
say that they know things that they can&#39;t</p>
<p t="1769110" d="5300">say because you might say, well the game - the
rules of the game come first and then the</p>
<p t="1774410" d="1880">game emerges, but that&#39;s wrong.</p>
<p t="1776290" d="5290">It’s the game comes first, and only after
that do the rules emerge, and of course there&#39;s</p>
<p t="1781580" d="4830">a reciprocal relationship between them because
once the rules are somewhat articulated, then</p>
<p t="1786410" d="4460">the game becomes more structured, you know,
and then the rules can become more structured</p>
<p t="1790870" d="1000">and so on.</p>
<p t="1791870" d="1990">So the articulation changes the rules.</p>
<p t="1793860" d="4290">What Nietzsche is saying is that the same
thing applies to societies.</p>
<p t="1798150" d="6620">He says like, insofar as you can consider
society a collective game played by millions</p>
<p t="1804770" d="6480">of people over vast spans of time, it’s
a game of games in some sense, and it emerged</p>
<p t="1811250" d="1580">from the bottom up.</p>
<p t="1812830" d="8410">It emerged out of biological impulses and
interpersonal and social interactions conditioning</p>
<p t="1821240" d="3780">and shaping everyone’s behavior and perception.</p>
<p t="1825020" d="5720">And that happened way before anyone could
articulate what those rules were.</p>
<p t="1830740" d="5920">Now remember, when Nietzsche was writing,
there was no real sense of how old the Earth</p>
<p t="1836660" d="2090">was or how old the universe was.</p>
<p t="1838750" d="4040">I mean, people thought - even the radical
people thought - maybe in terms of hundreds</p>
<p t="1842790" d="4660">of thousands of years, you know, and now we
know that the universe is 14 billion years</p>
<p t="1847450" d="5960">old and that the Earth is 4 billion years
old, and that life has been plentiful for</p>
<p t="1853410" d="2150">3.5 billion years, you know.</p>
<p t="1855560" d="8240">So the historical context within which we
originated has expanded by orders of magnitude</p>
<p t="1863800" d="5060">since the last nineteenth century and so then
what you think that means is that the way</p>
<p t="1868860" d="6070">that our games have been organized stretches
impossibly back in time.</p>
<p t="1874930" d="4810">Now I already told you - I believe - the story
about lobster dominance hierarchies right.</p>
<p t="1879740" d="3720">So even lobsters - that’s 400 million years
ago.</p>
<p t="1883460" d="4860">Lobsters arrayed themselves in a social space
and they regulate each other, and that means</p>
<p t="1888320" d="8290">the lobsters essentially have a lobster society,
and you know each lobster has biological predispositions</p>
<p t="1896610" d="2720">that are quite determined.</p>
<p t="1899330" d="5850">They&#39;re quite - the lobster’s quite a deterministic
creature, but nonetheless, the way those biological</p>
<p t="1905180" d="6690">predispositions manifest himself is conditioned
and shaped by the social surrounding, and</p>
<p t="1911870" d="5800">so you think well lobsters started to play
games 400 million years ago and you know,</p>
<p t="1917670" d="5480">as we’ve taken the tremendously long evolutionary
journey across that time, we’d been playing</p>
<p t="1923150" d="6930">social games the whole time and that means
that the way that we interact with each other</p>
<p t="1930080" d="4460">has evolved, and it’s even shaped the way
that our biology manifests itself because</p>
<p t="1934540" d="5750">that&#39;s how old culture is, and then out of
that as we became more capable of abstraction,</p>
<p t="1940290" d="5000">and maybe that&#39;s - you know, that&#39;s something
that really took off probably seven million</p>
<p t="1945290" d="5540">years ago with modern human beings emerging
about 150 thousand years ago because we separated</p>
<p t="1950830" d="4870">from the common ancestor of human beings and
chimpanzees about seven million years ago.</p>
<p t="1955700" d="3490">You can tell that by doing analysis of genetic
differences.</p>
<p t="1959190" d="5130">So the brain expanded very rapidly after that
point, and our culture became more and more</p>
<p t="1964320" d="5380">conscious and articulated and complex and
larger and more technological, you know.</p>
<p t="1969700" d="5920">So it became, in some ways, more dependent
on social norms and less dependent on deterministic</p>
<p t="1975620" d="4950">biological predispositions, but we’ve still
been doing that for a very long time.</p>
<p t="1980570" d="5800">There’s good evidence that, you know, we
started using fire about two million years</p>
<p t="1986370" d="4670">ago, and - forgive me if I’ve told you this
already but - you know if you look at a human</p>
<p t="1991040" d="3500">being, and you look at a chimpanzee, there’s
a bunch of things you can see that are very</p>
<p t="1994540" d="2090">different morphologically.</p>
<p t="1996630" d="5250">The chimp is much shorter, much much wider,
and way more powerful.</p>
<p t="2001880" d="5590">So like a normal male chimp is about as six
times as strong as the strongest Olympic athlete.</p>
<p t="2007470" d="1820">So, don&#39;t mess with chimps.</p>
<p t="2009290" d="1150">They’ll tear you apart.</p>
<p t="2010440" d="2190">They&#39;re really, really strong and dangerous.</p>
<p t="2012630" d="4000">But, the chimp is shaped sort of like this,
you know.</p>
<p t="2016630" d="4980">They have a huge gastrointestinal system,
roughly speaking, and the reason for that</p>
<p t="2021610" d="4280">is mostly what they eat is leaves, and leaves
have no color or content, and so they have</p>
<p t="2025890" d="5050">to eat immense numbers of leaves, and leaves
are hard to digest so they have to chew them</p>
<p t="2030940" d="1000">like mad.</p>
<p t="2031940" d="4280">So the the typical chimp sits around eight
hours a day chewing, and then they have this</p>
<p t="2036220" d="5120">tremendously long gastrointestinal system
because it takes that long to extract any</p>
<p t="2041340" d="2070">nutrients out of leaves.</p>
<p t="2043410" d="6180">Well, we circumvented that man, as soon as
we invented fire, and fire allows us to outsource</p>
<p t="2049590" d="5289">our digestion because if you cook most things:
vegetables, but most importantly meat.</p>
<p t="2054879" d="6961">If you cook them, they become much more bioavailable,
and it takes much less energy to digest them.</p>
<p t="2061840" d="5260">So that way you can shrink your gut and grow
your brain, and so that’s apparently what</p>
<p t="2067100" d="5299">we did because here we are, relatively slim
at least compared to chimpanzees.</p>
<p t="2072399" d="2510">And so, fire popped up two million years ago.</p>
<p t="2074909" d="5151">It’s a real cultural revolution, but you
know, that’s so old, that cultural revolution,</p>
<p t="2080060" d="5190">that it completely reshaped our bodies, and
so this interplay between biology and culture</p>
<p t="2085250" d="4830">has been going on for an unimaginably long
period of time, and it conditions everything</p>
<p t="2090080" d="1190">we do.</p>
<p t="2091270" d="9680">Now, here’s a complicated idea.</p>
<p t="2100950" d="8670">Okay, so imagine a wolf pack.</p>
<p t="2109620" d="4180">Now, a wolf pack is a pretty complicated social
group.</p>
<p t="2113800" d="6910">It’s a fair bit like a primordial human
group which is why dogs have been with us</p>
<p t="2120710" d="2790">for 25 thousand years.</p>
<p t="2123500" d="3290">Maybe they were wolves that first started
to follow us around and scavenge, or more</p>
<p t="2126790" d="8040">likely I think, someone went out - some primordial
hunter - went out hunting, killed a wolf female,</p>
<p t="2134830" d="5490">found the pups, and brought one home for the
children to play with, you know.</p>
<p t="2140320" d="2370">And that was the origin of the dog.</p>
<p t="2142690" d="4170">I think it was something like that because
dogs are basically - they&#39;re basically genetically</p>
<p t="2146860" d="1500">identical with wolves.</p>
<p t="2148360" d="4800">Now, the thing is, we can get along with dogs,
and the reason we can get along with dogs</p>
<p t="2153160" d="1310">is that dogs have a social organization.</p>
<p t="2154470" d="6310">You can call it a dominance hierarchy, that’s
a fair bit like the human social organization,</p>
<p t="2160780" d="4840">and so you can see that part of what it means
to be human is the same thing that it means</p>
<p t="2165620" d="5090">to be a pack animal like a dog or a pack animal
like our domesticated animals like horses</p>
<p t="2170710" d="4410">and cows for example, which we can domesticate
partly because they&#39;re social.</p>
<p t="2175120" d="5560">So some of the structure of our social organization
is the same sort of structure that an animal</p>
<p t="2180680" d="4030">dominance hierarchy has, like the chimpanzee
dominance hierarchy, for example.</p>
<p t="2184710" d="5240">And so we know that chimpanzees and other
primates, monkeys for example, are acutely</p>
<p t="2189950" d="5060">aware of the levels of hierarchy in their
social structure, and there are - I think</p>
<p t="2195010" d="1000">it’s vervet monkeys.</p>
<p t="2196010" d="1780">This is a very funny experiment.</p>
<p t="2197790" d="5080">So imagine that the top vervet monkeys are
like celebrity monkeys, you know, and the</p>
<p t="2202870" d="5510">bottom vervet monkeys are like dissolute street
people, and so then you take some picture</p>
<p t="2208380" d="3400">of dissolute street people who are just at
the bottom of the hierarchy, and you take</p>
<p t="2211780" d="5160">some pictures of celebrities, and you show
pictures to a human audience, and the human</p>
<p t="2216940" d="2350">audience will look at the celebrities longer.</p>
<p t="2219290" d="4500">Well, if you take the vervet monkeys, and
you take photographs of the top ranking vervet</p>
<p t="2223790" d="3290">monkeys and the bottom vervet monkeys and
you show them to vervet monkeys, then the</p>
<p t="2227080" d="4700">vervet monkeys will look at the top ranking
vervet monkey photographs more than the bottom</p>
<p t="2231780" d="1620">ranking vervet monkey photographs.</p>
<p t="2233400" d="5920">So in some sense, they&#39;re transfixed by the
individuals who are higher up in the social</p>
<p t="2239320" d="6180">order, and that makes sense, right, because
what you should feel - especially in a fairly</p>
<p t="2245500" d="4520">aggressive dominance hierarchy - what you
should feel the closer you are to the bottom</p>
<p t="2250020" d="4810">of the dominance hierarchy, the closer what
you should feel for whatever’s at the top</p>
<p t="2254830" d="4880">of the dominance hierarchy, it should be closer
and closer to awe.</p>
<p t="2259710" d="6110">Now, when people feel awe, they get chills
running up and down their back, their neck.</p>
<p t="2265820" d="3600">Well why - the reason that happens is because
it’s an atavism.</p>
<p t="2269420" d="5100">It’s a hangover from the time that you were
threatened by something awe inspiring, let’s</p>
<p t="2274520" d="3380">say a snake or a bear or something like that.</p>
<p t="2277900" d="5150">Your hair - your fur would stand up and the
reason for that is so that you look bigger,</p>
<p t="2283050" d="2830">and you still see this happening all the time
with cats, right.</p>
<p t="2285880" d="3970">Two cats will - normally cats face each other
this way, right.</p>
<p t="2289850" d="3760">But if they start to fight, they turn sideways
and that&#39;s so they each look bigger, and they</p>
<p t="2293610" d="4140">puff up their fur and their tail, and that&#39;s
to show the other cat that they&#39;re really</p>
<p t="2297750" d="1920">a lot bigger than the cat first thought.</p>
<p t="2299670" d="3490">Now of course, they&#39;re both doing that so
it’s a little bit pointless, but they&#39;re</p>
<p t="2303160" d="6020">just cats so you know, you can give them a
break, but the point is that they pilo erect,</p>
<p t="2309180" d="3350">and that&#39;s the same thing that happens, for
example when you&#39;re listening to very powerful</p>
<p t="2312530" d="2790">music and it deeply affects you and you get
chills.</p>
<p t="2315320" d="4970">It’s like the hair stands up on the back
of your neck, and that&#39;s a signalling of awe.</p>
<p t="2320290" d="4100">Now the reason you should feel awe towards
something that&#39;s higher up in the dominance</p>
<p t="2324390" d="5080">hierarchy is because that thing has power,
like - well there&#39;s more than one reason.</p>
<p t="2329470" d="1580">A, that thing has power.</p>
<p t="2331050" d="3660">You better be careful of it because it will
put you in your place, and fast.</p>
<p t="2334710" d="5400">And part of the reason that dominance hierarchy
exists is so that everybody knows their place</p>
<p t="2340110" d="5560">and they don&#39;t have to be reminded of it by
being half killed on a regular basis, you</p>
<p t="2345670" d="1000">know.</p>
<p t="2346670" d="4480">So maybe you&#39;re nine on a scale of one being
the top, maybe you&#39;re number nine.</p>
<p t="2351150" d="5200">It’s not so good, but number nine and not
hurting is a lot better than number nine and</p>
<p t="2356350" d="4010">lying there bleeding on the ground, and so
what happens with dominance hierarchies is</p>
<p t="2360360" d="6140">they usually arrange themselves in part by
power, but by no means only power.</p>
<p t="2366500" d="3030">Everybody knows where they are, and pretty
much everybody stays there, and that even</p>
<p t="2369530" d="5290">happens over multiple generations, say in
complex primate dominance troops.</p>
<p t="2374820" d="3010">Status is heritable.</p>
<p t="2377830" d="4420">So you know, there&#39;s not much of a leap between
that and heritable monarchies among human</p>
<p t="2382250" d="1000">beings.</p>
<p t="2383250" d="2890">It’s a reflection of - you know, it’s
much more complex among human beings because</p>
<p t="2386140" d="4480">it’s articulated and structured, but it’s
the same basic thing.</p>
<p t="2390620" d="3920">Now, Nietzsche’s point was - so now imagine…</p>
<p t="2394540" d="4250">Here’s another problem.</p>
<p t="2398790" d="8560">So, imagine that…</p>
<p t="2407350" d="5140">Okay so you&#39;ve got a dominance hierarchy,
and it’s fairly stable, and one of the things</p>
<p t="2412490" d="3790">that you wanna do is climb to the top of the
dominance hierarchy, and the reason you want</p>
<p t="2416280" d="4580">to do that - there&#39;s all sorts of reasons:
high quality mates - that&#39;s the primary reason.</p>
<p t="2420860" d="6360">That’s particularly true in humans if you&#39;re
male because males are much more differential</p>
<p t="2427220" d="5020">reproducers than females which means a lot
of males fail to reproduce completely, and</p>
<p t="2432240" d="5340">some reproduce a lot whereas the typical woman
reproduces at least some.</p>
<p t="2437580" d="3900">So that means competition is more intense
among men, and that&#39;s part of the reason why</p>
<p t="2441480" d="4250">dominance hierarchies tend to be tilted towards
male power because competition means more</p>
<p t="2445730" d="1000">to them.</p>
<p t="2446730" d="1370">The outcome is more crucial.</p>
<p t="2448100" d="6350">So, now part of what happens is that as people
compete within the dominance hierarchy, what</p>
<p t="2454450" d="6760">they&#39;re doing is to try to figure out who
it is that is fit to be on top.</p>
<p t="2461210" d="6650">Now, you might think that that’s a matter
of power, you know, and in fact your basic</p>
<p t="2467860" d="4190">social leftie, social constructionists would
have you believe that was all there is to</p>
<p t="2472050" d="4830">it, is that the whole dominance hierarchy
is nothing but a power system, and the people</p>
<p t="2476880" d="5220">on top are there because they have power,
and what&#39;s there is power, and by that they</p>
<p t="2482100" d="3710">mean the ability to enforce their will on
other people.</p>
<p t="2485810" d="6830">Well that&#39;s a dopey theory, and the reason
for that is it’s unidimensional.</p>
<p t="2492640" d="2660">We know that people are multi-faceted.</p>
<p t="2495300" d="2240">There&#39;s no single motivation that&#39;s king.</p>
<p t="2497540" d="4070">You know, for Freud it was sex and aggression,
and like if you&#39;re gonna come up with a couple</p>
<p t="2501610" d="4660">of potent candidates, those are two, but there&#39;s
lots of other ones.</p>
<p t="2506270" d="3980">People are playful and play is a primary biological
circuit, you know.</p>
<p t="2510250" d="1000">We suffer.</p>
<p t="2511250" d="1000">We’re hungry.</p>
<p t="2512250" d="1100">We’re thirsty.</p>
<p t="2513350" d="1090">We’re affiliative.</p>
<p t="2514440" d="7860">Like, there&#39;s a lot of biological necessity
driving the makeup of our personalities, and</p>
<p t="2522300" d="5390">there are biological subpersonalities and
to arbitrarily call one of them the source</p>
<p t="2527690" d="7040">of something as complex as social organization
is - it’s a false form of monotheism.</p>
<p t="2534730" d="6360">It’s a crazy idea, and it’s the kind of
idea that only people who really don&#39;t like</p>
<p t="2541090" d="4840">to think would have because once you come
up with that idea, it’s all power, you don&#39;t</p>
<p t="2545930" d="1790">have to think anymore.</p>
<p t="2547720" d="4472">Someone can say to you, “Well why is complex
phenomena X the way it is?</p>
<p t="2552192" d="2368">Why is the economy arranged the way it is?</p>
<p t="2554560" d="3210">Well, it’s so the people at the top can
maintain their power.”</p>
<p t="2557770" d="5870">Well, yeah sure, but maybe that accounts for
ten percent of the reason.</p>
<p t="2563640" d="1950">It doesn&#39;t get close to a hundred percent.</p>
<p t="2565590" d="7730">There&#39;s lot of reasons why hierarchies are
structured the way they are and sheer physical</p>
<p t="2573320" d="3710">force is one of them, but it’s unstable.</p>
<p t="2577030" d="6320">So, Frans de Waal who was watching chimps
organize their dominance hierarchies in the</p>
<p t="2583350" d="6070">Arnhem Zoo in Holland, noted quite quickly
that it was fairly typical, or at least possible,</p>
<p t="2589420" d="5940">for the meanest, ugliest, strongest male chimp
to be the dominant guy.</p>
<p t="2595360" d="3790">Sometimes it was the chimp who learned to
pick up a garbage can and whack the hell out</p>
<p t="2599150" d="3230">of it with a stick because that intimidated
his enemies, you know.</p>
<p t="2602380" d="6980">So there&#39;s a bit of creativity there, but
what De Waal found was that the stable hierarchies</p>
<p t="2609360" d="5500">were never run by barbarian chimp dictators,
and the reason for that was that coalitions</p>
<p t="2614860" d="6450">of other males would take them out because
you think, well if you&#39;re one anti-social,</p>
<p t="2621310" d="6930">aggressive male, and you&#39;re tough, it’s
like okay you&#39;re tough, but three lesser,</p>
<p t="2628240" d="6290">friendlier males who are bound together in
a friendship pact which chimpanzees form quite</p>
<p t="2634530" d="1000">intensely.</p>
<p t="2635530" d="3850">It’s like as soon as that guy turns his
back or has a bad day or gets hurt, they&#39;re</p>
<p t="2639380" d="4010">going to jump in there and tear him to pieces,
and that&#39;s exactly what happened.</p>
<p t="2643390" d="5200">So what De Waal found was that the stabler
chimpanzee dominance hierarchies were run</p>
<p t="2648590" d="6620">usually by males, who were affiliative and
gregarious, who remembered their social obligations,</p>
<p t="2655210" d="5050">so that meant with regard to their friendship
network, and who were also very good to the</p>
<p t="2660260" d="5590">females and the infants in the troop even
if they weren&#39;t his, and the idea there is</p>
<p t="2665850" d="5130">that power is an unstable basis for the maintenance
of a dominance hierarchy across time because</p>
<p t="2670980" d="5240">in some sense, even among chimps, you have
to have the consent of the governed because</p>
<p t="2676220" d="2190">you&#39;ll get a revolution otherwise.</p>
<p t="2678410" d="4270">So you know, you&#39;re going to get a revolution
if you put people, or animals, in a situation</p>
<p t="2682680" d="6430">where they have nothing to lose, and so what
that means is there are constraints on how</p>
<p t="2689110" d="5220">you can act while you try to move up the dominance
hierarchy system because if you&#39;re too aggressive</p>
<p t="2694330" d="4550">and selfish and you&#39;re not grooming anyone
else, and you&#39;re not communicating with the</p>
<p t="2698880" d="6560">other creatures in the troop, they&#39;re gonna
gang up on you and take you down, and so if</p>
<p t="2705440" d="4860">you&#39;re gonna maneuver your way up the troop,
you have to do it in a manner that&#39;s civilized</p>
<p t="2710300" d="4210">enough so that you don&#39;t get everyone against
you.</p>
<p t="2714510" d="5470">So what it means is to maneuver up a power
hierarchy, especially a complex power hierarchy,</p>
<p t="2719980" d="3010">you have to be a lot more than powerful.</p>
<p t="2722990" d="2740">So, okay now.</p>
<p t="2725730" d="6600">So, now we’ve got this idea that there are
principles governing the movement of creatures</p>
<p t="2732330" d="7420">up a dominance hierarchy, even among the animals,
and one of the defining characteristics that</p>
<p t="2739750" d="8680">- one of the characteristics that necessity
makes delimit that process is that over time,</p>
<p t="2748430" d="4960">the troop can&#39;t let anybody climb the dominance
hierarchy who will destabilize the whole dominance</p>
<p t="2753390" d="2260">hierarchy because then that&#39;s it.</p>
<p t="2755650" d="1000">Game over.</p>
<p t="2756650" d="3430">So at the very least, you have to learn how
to climb up the hierarchy so that you don&#39;t</p>
<p t="2760080" d="5170">destabilize it while you climb because otherwise
you get to the top and there&#39;s nothing left.</p>
<p t="2765250" d="1790">Well, and animals know this.</p>
<p t="2767040" d="1110">They know this instinctively.</p>
<p t="2768150" d="4680">So for example, when wolves go at it, you
know, first they puff up and they growl at</p>
<p t="2772830" d="4320">each other, and they put up their shoulders,
and like they get more and more aggressive</p>
<p t="2777150" d="3460">until attack is imminent, and often one of
them will back up.</p>
<p t="2780610" d="1980">There&#39;s no fighting.</p>
<p t="2782590" d="4120">No one gets damaged, and so that&#39;s the typical
situation.</p>
<p t="2786710" d="3880">It’s like one says, “Yeah okay, I’m
out of here.”</p>
<p t="2790590" d="2070">And god only knows why that is.</p>
<p t="2792660" d="4770">Often I suspect the wolf with the higher serotonin
level wins because it has less negative emotion,</p>
<p t="2797430" d="3730">and serotonin levels go up as you move up
the dominance hierarchy.</p>
<p t="2801160" d="4959">Now and then, they&#39;ll actually have a fight
but the fight usually doesn&#39;t last very long,</p>
<p t="2806119" d="4921">and then the loser will roll over, show its
throat to the winner, which is quite a behavior</p>
<p t="2811040" d="5950">because wolves tear the throats out of their
prey, and the top wolf will back off, and</p>
<p t="2816990" d="1000">you know you think about it.</p>
<p t="2817990" d="3200">That’s unbelievably sophisticated morality.</p>
<p t="2821190" d="5570">There&#39;s echos in there of the New Testament
in junction to love your enemy because that&#39;s</p>
<p t="2826760" d="4410">exactly what the wolf is doing, and you know,
it doesn&#39;t know this because it can&#39;t articulate</p>
<p t="2831170" d="6070">the rule, but what it’s doing is acting
as if even the thing that attacked you is</p>
<p t="2837240" d="4100">valuable in its own right if its a part of
your troop.</p>
<p t="2841340" d="7110">And you know, you can see there the ancient
biological origins of the idea, you know,</p>
<p t="2848450" d="3500">of the equality and value of each individual.</p>
<p t="2851950" d="2590">So these things have deep, deep, deep, roots.</p>
<p t="2854540" d="1100">They&#39;re not arbitrary.</p>
<p t="2855640" d="3480">They&#39;re not arbitrary, and no one invented
them, and that&#39;s exactly what Nietzsche is</p>
<p t="2859120" d="1130">saying here.</p>
<p t="2860250" d="5920">“To understand how the abstrusest metaphysical
assertions of a philosopher have been arrived,</p>
<p t="2866170" d="7500">it is always well and wise to first ask oneself,
what morality do they or does he aim at?</p>
<p t="2873670" d="5800">Accordingly, I do not believe that an impulse
to knowledge is the father of philosophy;</p>
<p t="2879470" d="5639">but that another impulse, here as elsewhere,
has only made use of knowledge (and mistaken</p>
<p t="2885109" d="2591">knowledge!) as an instrument.</p>
<p t="2887700" d="5390">But whoever considers the fundamental impulses
of man with a view to determining how far</p>
<p t="2893090" d="6250">they may have here acted as INSPIRING GENII
(or as demons), will find that they have all</p>
<p t="2899340" d="3830">practiced philosophy at one time or another,
and that each one of them would have been</p>
<p t="2903170" d="5630">only too glad to look upon itself as the ultimate
end of existence and the legitimate lord over</p>
<p t="2908800" d="1140">all the other impulses.”</p>
<p t="2909940" d="2240">So what is he saying there?</p>
<p t="2912180" d="4670">Well, you know, Nietzsche makes this explicit
in passages that are related to this one.</p>
<p t="2916850" d="6030">He viewed the human being as a collection
of subsouls, and the subsouls were grounded</p>
<p t="2922880" d="4970">in their existence in biological underpinnings,
and that was the case for every human being</p>
<p t="2927850" d="2019">and that made us roughly similar.</p>
<p t="2929869" d="6811">It certainly made our groups roughly similar,
and so these - each of these biological subsystems</p>
<p t="2936680" d="5260">conceptualized as a subsoul was something
that had its own viewpoint, had its own rules,</p>
<p t="2941940" d="3540">had its own games, and they jockey for precedence.</p>
<p t="2945480" d="4040">You know, you know that because sometimes
you&#39;re sitting there reading and you&#39;re trying</p>
<p t="2949520" d="5310">to concentrate on a higher order goal like
completing your classes, and you know, some</p>
<p t="2954830" d="4770">biologically determined subsystem pops up
and says you know, “This would be an excellent</p>
<p t="2959600" d="2120">time to go have a coffee.”</p>
<p t="2961720" d="5840">You know, and you might do everything you
can to not allow that thing to take over,</p>
<p t="2967560" d="6030">but often it does and often that&#39;s despite
what you think you might actually want to</p>
<p t="2973590" d="5010">do, and then later you&#39;re all upset about
it because you&#39;ve procrastinated yet again,</p>
<p t="2978600" d="5190">but you know, Nietzsche viewed the psyche
as a place - you could almost think of yourself</p>
<p t="2983790" d="8190">as a set of abstract, it’s like your brain
is a set of animals, and the animals are all</p>
<p t="2991980" d="5700">dependent on one another but each animal needs
to be bossed from time to time, and each animal</p>
<p t="2997680" d="6330">wants to be bossed more often than it should
be, and then you know, the higher order cortical</p>
<p t="3004010" d="5450">systems are there to figure out how to sequence
all the other animals so that they all get</p>
<p t="3009460" d="6010">what they need without interfering with each
other across large spans of time in the presence</p>
<p t="3015470" d="3120">of many other people in a manner that&#39;s sustaining.</p>
<p t="3018590" d="3200">It’s very, very complicated.</p>
<p t="3021790" d="4060">Okay now, so let’s go back to the hierarchy.</p>
<p t="3025850" d="6100">So, you have the hierarchy and over time - now
remember, this hierarchy stays there for a</p>
<p t="3031950" d="4740">very long period of time, and remember as
well that the people who climb to the top</p>
<p t="3036690" d="6030">of the hierarchy are much more likely to leave
offspring than the people who don&#39;t, and so</p>
<p t="3042720" d="6520">then what that means is that the hierarchy,
in part, is one of the primary selection forces</p>
<p t="3049240" d="6450">operating on humanity, and what that means
is that we evolve towards the thing that can</p>
<p t="3055690" d="5470">most successfully evolve the dominance hierarchy,
and so that means that we evolve towards the</p>
<p t="3061160" d="8130">thing that has the best probability of ruling
properly, and that that’s not just cultural.</p>
<p t="3069290" d="5060">It’s cultural because it’s the continual
interplay between culture and biology going</p>
<p t="3074350" d="5420">back, we’ll say, four hundred million years
or more.</p>
<p t="3079770" d="4849">Okay now, but it’s even more complicated
than that, and this is - one of the things</p>
<p t="3084619" d="3631">that you have to understand if you really
want to understand what Nietzsche meant by</p>
<p t="3088250" d="2910">the death of God because that&#39;s his most famous
pronouncement.</p>
<p t="3091160" d="3630">“God is dead and we have killed him, and
we’ll never find enough water to wash away</p>
<p t="3094790" d="1130">the blood.”</p>
<p t="3095920" d="2530">So he wasn&#39;t announcing that in triumph.</p>
<p t="3098450" d="2280">He was announcing it in terror.</p>
<p t="3100730" d="1920">Okay now, imagine this.</p>
<p t="3102650" d="5190">So as human society becomes more complex,
and as our brains become larger and larger</p>
<p t="3107840" d="7890">so that we could track larger social organizations,
and we can organize more complex communities,</p>
<p t="3115730" d="6550">what happens is that heretofore isolated tribes
of people come together, and then they have</p>
<p t="3122280" d="6370">to engage in conflict and negotiation, and
partly what they&#39;re in conflict about is what</p>
<p t="3128650" d="4719">is the way that you should act, and what should
the values be.</p>
<p t="3133369" d="5431">Now there&#39;s an old mythological idea that
the gods fight in heaven to see who is the</p>
<p t="3138800" d="1000">dominant god.</p>
<p t="3139800" d="7630">Well you can imagine all of these individual
tribes, they had their ideals, and those were</p>
<p t="3147430" d="6160">creatures of their imagination, but those
were imagined representations of proper behavioral</p>
<p t="3153590" d="5810">patterns, and they saw those as transcendent
and superordinate, and so then tribe A would</p>
<p t="3159400" d="7010">come into contact with tribe B and the gods
would clash, and out of that and all the death</p>
<p t="3166410" d="3760">and destruction that went with it, the two
tribes would integrate, and maybe that would</p>
<p t="3170170" d="3980">take, you know, hundreds of years, and the
religious system that sat above that which</p>
<p t="3174150" d="4620">was the representation of the dominance hierarchy
would also transform.</p>
<p t="3178770" d="3460">So you take tribe A, and then you take tribe
B, and then you take tribe C, and then you</p>
<p t="3182230" d="8850">take tribe D, and they all accumulate across
time and sort out and articulate and represent</p>
<p t="3191080" d="6250">all of their beliefs, and what happens is
that this tribe has a game, and this tribe</p>
<p t="3197330" d="3940">has a game, and this tribe has a game, and
then if you put all of those games together,</p>
<p t="3201270" d="3700">they tilt so that a metagame emerges out of
it.</p>
<p t="3204970" d="5980">It’s like - if it’s fortunate - the best
of all three games gets put together in a</p>
<p t="3210950" d="4330">larger game, and it has to be the best because
otherwise it won&#39;t work.</p>
<p t="3215280" d="6550">The thing will fall apart right, because if
your family unit isn&#39;t functional, it&#39;ll disperse,</p>
<p t="3221830" d="3170">and you know maybe people will die because
of it.</p>
<p t="3225000" d="2140">It has to have the - it has to be iteratable.</p>
<p t="3227140" d="5500">It has to be playable across time without
falling apart from internal pressure, and</p>
<p t="3232640" d="1810">without getting wiped out from the outside.</p>
<p t="3234450" d="2870">So it’s very tightly constrained.</p>
<p t="3237320" d="2660">So then let’s say this happens over tens
of thousands of years.</p>
<p t="3239980" d="2780">We could say, well it happened in the Middle
East because we know that.</p>
<p t="3242760" d="4940">As Mesopotamia came together, for example,
it was the aggregation of multiple tribes</p>
<p t="3247700" d="5240">and all of the gods of those tribes, and we
know the Mesopotamians organized all those</p>
<p t="3252940" d="6060">gods into one god, his name was Marduk, and
that the story that they tell about the aggregation</p>
<p t="3259000" d="6900">of the gods into one is the story of the gods
getting together, and voting on which of them</p>
<p t="3265900" d="6550">should be at the top, and then we know that
the Mesopotamian emperor was charged with</p>
<p t="3272450" d="6170">the responsibility of acting out that top
god, and that that&#39;s what made him a good</p>
<p t="3278620" d="4090">emperor, and he got reminded of that every
year with the New Year’s ceremony.</p>
<p t="3282710" d="4180">He had to tell all the ways that he hadn’t
been a good Marduk and then he’d get punished</p>
<p t="3286890" d="4990">for it, and then they would reenact the battle
of the gods and recreate this Marduk character.</p>
<p t="3291880" d="4300">Okay, so you can understand how that might
have come about.</p>
<p t="3296180" d="7540">Now you can say that the idea of that emergent
ideal, that wasn&#39;t rational.</p>
<p t="3303720" d="6050">It was the consequence of conflict and cooperation
in the real world across time.</p>
<p t="3309770" d="4960">The representations of that were, you know,
we might think about them as narrative representations</p>
<p t="3314730" d="2240">or if they&#39;re deep enough, even as mythology.</p>
<p t="3316970" d="5920">We can think about those as the soil from
which religious presuppositions emerge, and</p>
<p t="3322890" d="6390">so what happens is that what you have at the
top of the dominance hierarchy as your representation</p>
<p t="3329280" d="7630">of the good person is no different in its
totality than the idea of the sovereign god</p>
<p t="3336910" d="4220">that has emerged across thousands and thousands
of years of human history.</p>
<p t="3341130" d="5860">So the whole structure has this thing at the
top, and it’s regarded in imagination as</p>
<p t="3346990" d="1000">divine.</p>
<p t="3347990" d="6390">It’s the consequence of the - it’s the
consequence of the battle of representations</p>
<p t="3354380" d="6110">of morality in imagination across thousands
and thousands of years, and that’s a reflection</p>
<p t="3360490" d="5359">of the actual conflict and restructuring of
societies across all that time.</p>
<p t="3365849" d="1481">So then you have this thing at the top.</p>
<p t="3367330" d="4650">So we can say in the West, in Western Europe,
that thing at the top is Christ, and that&#39;s</p>
<p t="3371980" d="6090">the dying - the dying, and the revivifying
hero.</p>
<p t="3378070" d="1410">We talked about reasons for that.</p>
<p t="3379480" d="2740">That&#39;s the thing that can go to the underworld
and then come back up.</p>
<p t="3382220" d="2899">Okay, that’s at the top.</p>
<p t="3385119" d="1521">What happens when it disappears?</p>
<p t="3386640" d="10510">Well, we’ll turn to Dostoevsky for that.</p>
<p t="3397150" d="2040">This is from “Notes From Underground.”</p>
<p t="3399190" d="4060">So this is someone who’s in the underground,
and that&#39;s where you go when your value systems</p>
<p t="3403250" d="1000">collapse.</p>
<p t="3404250" d="1000">“I am a sick man.</p>
<p t="3405250" d="2090">... I am a spiteful man.</p>
<p t="3407340" d="2060">I am an unattractive man.</p>
<p t="3409400" d="2250">I believe my liver is diseased.</p>
<p t="3411650" d="5280">However, I know nothing at all about my disease,
and do not know for certain what ails me.</p>
<p t="3416930" d="4780">I don&#39;t consult a doctor for it, and never
have, though I have a respect for medicine</p>
<p t="3421710" d="1250">and doctors.</p>
<p t="3422960" d="6870">Besides, I am extremely superstitious, sufficiently
so to respect medicine, anyway (I am well-educated</p>
<p t="3429830" d="2980">enough not to be superstitious, but I am superstitious).</p>
<p t="3432810" d="2780">No, I refuse to consult a doctor from spite.</p>
<p t="3435590" d="3450">That you probably will not understand.</p>
<p t="3439040" d="3440">Well, I understand it, though.</p>
<p t="3442480" d="5830">Of course, I can&#39;t explain who it is precisely
that I am mortifying in this case by my spite:</p>
<p t="3448310" d="5920">I am perfectly well aware that I cannot &quot;pay
out&quot; the doctors and extract revenge by not</p>
<p t="3454230" d="4560">consulting them; I know better than anyone
that by all this I am only injuring myself</p>
<p t="3458790" d="1090">and no one else.</p>
<p t="3459880" d="3800">But still, if I don&#39;t consult a doctor it
is from spite.</p>
<p t="3463680" d="3700">My liver is bad, well--let it get worse!”</p>

civil servant, and he’s retired because</p>
<p t="3474550" d="2420">he got a little bit of inheritance.</p>

for information to the table at which I sat,</p>
<p t="3483119" d="5431">I used to grind my teeth at them, and I felt
intense enjoyment when I succeeded in making</p>
<p t="3488550" d="1110">anybody unhappy.</p>
<p t="3489660" d="3370">I almost always succeeded.</p>
<p t="3493030" d="4930">For the most part they were all timid people—of
course, they were petitioners.</p>
<p t="3497960" d="4430">But you know gentlemen what was the chief
point about my spite?</p>
<p t="3502390" d="5100">Well, the whole point, the real sting of it
lay it in the fact that continually, even</p>
<p t="3507490" d="5640">in the moment of the acutest spleen, I was
inwardly conscious with shame that I was not</p>
<p t="3513130" d="6180">only not spiteful, but not even embittered,
and that I was simply scaring sparrows at</p>
<p t="3519310" d="3950">random and amusing myself by it.</p>
<p t="3523260" d="3410">I was lying when I just said now that I was
a spiteful official.</p>
<p t="3526670" d="2080">I was lying from spite.</p>
<p t="3528750" d="4690">I was simply amusing myself with the petitioners
and with the officers, and in reality I never</p>
<p t="3533440" d="1720">could become spiteful.</p>
<p t="3535160" d="5680">I was conscious every moment in myself of
many, very many elements absolutely opposite</p>
<p t="3540840" d="1000">to that.</p>
<p t="3541840" d="4130">I felt them positively swarming in me, these
opposite elements.</p>
<p t="3545970" d="4940">I knew that they had been swarming in me my
whole life, and craving some outlet from me,</p>
<p t="3550910" d="5760">but I would not let them out -- would not
let them purposefully, purposefully would</p>
<p t="3556670" d="1470">not let them out.</p>
<p t="3558140" d="1990">They tormented me until I was ashamed.</p>
<p t="3560130" d="4520">They drove me to convultions, and sickened
me at last.</p>
<p t="3564650" d="2260">At last, how they sickened me.</p>
<p t="3566910" d="5150">Now, you&#39;re not fancying gentlemen, that I
am expressing remorse for something now.</p>
<p t="3572060" d="2030">That I am asking for forgiveness for something.</p>
<p t="3574090" d="5370">I am sure you are fancying that; however,
I assure you I do not care if you are.</p>
<p t="3579460" d="4090">It was not only that I could not become spiteful.</p>
<p t="3583550" d="4460">I did not know how to become anything, neither
spiteful nor kind.</p>
<p t="3588010" d="3390">Neither a rascal or an honest man.</p>
<p t="3591400" d="4690">Neither a hero, nor an insect.</p>
<p t="3596090" d="5050">Now I am living my life out in my corner,
taunting myself with the spiteless and useless</p>
<p t="3601140" d="5479">consolation that an intelligent man cannot
become anything seriously, and it is only</p>
<p t="3606619" d="4161">the fool who becomes anything.”</p>

<p t="3634760" d="2120">How do you know?</p>
<p t="3636880" d="5040">Perhaps it’s very beautiful in fact, and
I am the more persuaded of that suspicion</p>
<p t="3641920" d="4610">- if one can call it so - by the fact that
you take, for instance, the antithesis of</p>
<p t="3646530" d="5330">the normal man, that is the man of acute self
consciousness who has come, of course, not</p>
<p t="3651860" d="3210">out of the lap of nature but out of a retort.</p>
<p t="3655070" d="4289">This is also almost mysticism, gentlemen,
but I suspect this too.</p>
<p t="3659359" d="5101">This retort made man is sometimes so nonplussed
in the presence of his antithesis, the normal</p>
<p t="3664460" d="6560">man, that with all his exaggerated self consciousness
he generally thinks himself a mouse, and not</p>
<p t="3671020" d="1670">a man at all.</p>

<p t="3693460" d="8770">Let us suppose for instance that it feels
insulted, and it almost always feels insulted,</p>
<p t="3702230" d="1890">and it wants to revenge itself too.</p>
<p t="3704120" d="6489">There may even be a greater accumulation of
spite in it than in the man of nature and</p>
<p t="3710609" d="1000">truth.</p>
<p t="3711609" d="4861">The base and nasty desire to vent that spite
on its assailant rankles perhaps even more</p>
<p t="3716470" d="3530">nastily in it than in the man of nature and
truth.</p>
<p t="3720000" d="5940">For through his innate stupidity, the latter,
the normal man, looks upon his revenge as</p>
<p t="3725940" d="2010">justice pure and simple.</p>
<p t="3727950" d="4780">Well, in consequence of his acute self consciousness,
the mouse does not believe in any justice</p>
<p t="3732730" d="1690">of it at all.</p>
<p t="3734420" d="6580">To come at last to the deed itself, to the
very act of revenge, apart of the one fundamental</p>
<p t="3741000" d="5420">nastiness the luckless mouse succeeds in creating
around it, so many nastinesses in the form</p>
<p t="3746420" d="5460">of doubts and questions adds to the one question
so many unsettled questions that there are</p>
<p t="3751880" d="7450">inevitably works up around it a sort of fatal
brew, a stinking mess, made up of its doubts,</p>
<p t="3759330" d="5150">emotions, and of the contempt spat upon it
by the direct men of action who stand solemnly</p>
<p t="3764480" d="5960">about it as judges and arbitrators, laughing
at it till their healthy sides ache.</p>
<p t="3770440" d="6140">Of course the only thing left for it is to
dismiss all that with a wave of its paw, and,</p>
<p t="3776580" d="6460">with a smile of assumed contempt in which
it does not even itself believe, creep ignominiously</p>
<p t="3783040" d="1000">into its mouse-hole.</p>
<p t="3784040" d="7200">There in its nasty, stinking, underground
home our insulted, crushed and ridiculed mouse</p>
<p t="3791240" d="7860">promptly becomes absorbed in cold, malignant
and, above all, everlasting spite.</p>
<p t="3799100" d="6170">For forty years together it will remember
its injury down to the smallest, most ignominious</p>
<p t="3805270" d="5620">details, and every time will add, of itself,
details still more ignominious, spitefully</p>
<p t="3810890" d="3540">teasing and tormenting itself with its own
imagination.</p>
<p t="3814430" d="5390">It will itself be ashamed of its imaginings,
but yet it will recall it all, it will go</p>
<p t="3819820" d="4350">over and over every detail, it will invent
unheard of things against itself, pretending</p>
<p t="3824170" d="4550">that those things might have happened, and
will forgive nothing.</p>
<p t="3828720" d="7730">Maybe it will begin to revenge itself, too,
but, as it were, piecemeal, in trivial ways,</p>
<p t="3836450" d="5100">from behind the stove, incognito, without
believing either in its own right to vengeance,</p>
<p t="3841550" d="4890">or in the success of its revenge, knowing
that from all its efforts at revenge it will</p>
<p t="3846440" d="6880">suffer a hundred times more than he on whom
it revenges itself, while he, I daresay, will</p>
<p t="3853320" d="2350">not even scratch himself.</p>
<p t="3855670" d="5250">On its deathbed it will recall it all over
again, with interest accumulated over all</p>
<p t="3860920" d="9960">the years.”</p>
<p t="3870880" d="17160">Now, the idea that Nietzsche and Dostoevsky
were developing was that the dawning consciousness</p>
<p t="3888040" d="11740">in Western society of the mythological substructure
of the value system and the impossibility</p>
<p t="3899780" d="9790">of conceptualizing that or proving the validity
of its structure from scientific means doomed</p>
<p t="3909570" d="7490">it to - doomed the people who were encapsulated
in that system to formal disbelief in it,</p>
<p t="3917060" d="6340">and what they concluded from that was exactly
what Dostoevsky just described which was that</p>
<p t="3923400" d="5920">someone with that level of acute self-consciousness
and culture self knowledge would immediately</p>
<p t="3929320" d="5650">become fragmented beyond belief, unable to
act, unhappy, resentful, and dangerous.</p>
<p t="3934970" d="7380">And both Dostoevsky and Nietzsche, in their
works, and Dostoevsky developed this idea</p>
<p t="3942350" d="4300">mostly particularly in a novel called “The
Devils,” said that once that you had got</p>
<p t="3946650" d="4770">to that point, which was inevitable if you
were smart enough to take seriously what was</p>
<p t="3951420" d="7160">going on, it was only a tiny step to identification
with a murderous ideology.</p>
<p t="3958580" d="8370">Now, some of the existentialists started to
work up what you might regard as a solution</p>
<p t="3966950" d="5830">to this problem.</p>
<p t="3972780" d="11589">And I’m going to read Kierkegaard’s solution.</p>
<p t="3984369" d="6871">“It is now…”</p>
<p t="3991240" d="7420">Kierkegaard was a Danish existential philosopher
and he lived earlier than Nietzsche, and he</p>
<p t="3998660" d="5449">was, in some sense, you might think of him
as the first modern psychologist.</p>
<p t="4004109" d="5331">He was the first person to conceptualize,
for example, of the separate entity of anxiety</p>
<p t="4009440" d="2100">and despair.</p>
<p t="4011540" d="6819">“It is now about four years ago that I got
the notion of wanting to try my luck as an</p>
<p t="4018359" d="1631">author.</p>
<p t="4019990" d="3530">I remember it quite clearly.</p>
<p t="4023520" d="1000">It was on a Sunday.</p>
<p t="4024520" d="1200">Yes, that’s it.</p>
<p t="4025720" d="1280">A Sunday afternoon.</p>
<p t="4027000" d="5190">I was seated, as usual, out of doors at the
cafe in the Fredericksburg Garden.</p>
<p t="4032190" d="6450">I’d been a student for half a score of years,
although never lazy, all my activity nevertheless</p>
<p t="4038640" d="4890">was like a glittering inactivity, a kind of
occupation for which I still have a great</p>
<p t="4043530" d="3920">partiality, and for which I perhaps even have
a little genius.</p>
<p t="4047450" d="5600">I read much, spent the remainder of the day
idling and thinking, or thinking and idling,</p>
<p t="4053050" d="1110">but that was all it came to.</p>
<p t="4054160" d="4790">So I sat there and smoked my cigar until I
lapsed into thought.</p>
<p t="4058950" d="2680">Among other thoughts, I remember these.</p>
<p t="4061630" d="5380">‘You are going on’, I said to myself,
‘to become an old man without being anything</p>
<p t="4067010" d="2490">and without really undertaking to do anything.</p>
<p t="4069500" d="5550">On the other hand, wherever you look around
you in life, and in literature, you see the</p>
<p t="4075050" d="4360">celebrated names and figures, the precious
and much heralded men who are coming into</p>
<p t="4079410" d="2810">prominence and who are much talked about.</p>
<p t="4082220" d="5090">The many benefactors of the age you know how
to benefit mankind by making life easier and</p>
<p t="4087310" d="5710">easier, some by railways, others by omnibuses
and steamboats, and others by telegraph.</p>
<p t="4093020" d="5469">Others by easily apprehended compendiums and
shortly recitals of everything worth knowing,</p>
<p t="4098489" d="5720">and finally the true benefactors of the age
who make spiritual existence easier and easier,</p>
<p t="4104209" d="3130">yet more and more significant, and what are
you doing?’</p>
<p t="4107339" d="4820">Here, my soliloquy was interrupted for my
cigar was smoked out, and a new one had to</p>
<p t="4112159" d="1000">be lit.</p>
<p t="4113159" d="4540">So I smoked again, and then suddenly this
thought flashed through my mind: “You must</p>
<p t="4117699" d="5800">do something, but inasmuch as with your limited
capacities it will be impossible to make anything</p>
<p t="4123499" d="6911">easier than it has become, you must, with
the same humanitarian enthusiasm as the others,</p>
<p t="4130410" d="1459">undertake to make something harder.”</p>
<p t="4131869" d="5531">This notion pleased me immensely, and at the
same time it flattered me to think that I</p>
<p t="4137400" d="6290">like the rest of them, would be loved and
esteemed by the whole community.</p>
<p t="4143690" d="4549">For when all combine in every way to make
everything easier, there remains only one</p>
<p t="4148239" d="6520">possible danger, namely, that the ease becomes
so great that it becomes altogether too great;</p>
<p t="4154759" d="4400">then there is only one want left, though it
is not yet a felt want, when people will want</p>
<p t="4159159" d="1060">difficulty.</p>
<p t="4160219" d="5250">Out of love for mankind, and out of despair
at my embarrassing situation, seeing that</p>
<p t="4165469" d="6330">I had accomplished nothing and was unable
to make anything easier than it already was,</p>
<p t="4171799" d="7310">and moved by a genuine interest in those make
everything easy, I conceived it as my task</p>
<p t="4179109" d="13030">to create difficulties everywhere.”</p>
<p t="4192139" d="1551">Same idea, in different words.</p>
<p t="4193690" d="1000">“A traveler.”</p>
<p t="4194690" d="3659">This is Nietzsche, and this is part of the
development of the answer to the conundrum</p>
<p t="4198349" d="1520">that he raised.</p>
<p t="4199869" d="4161">“A traveller who had seen many countries
and peoples and several continents was asked</p>
<p t="4204030" d="5239">what human traits he had found everywhere;
and he answered: men are inclined to laziness.</p>
<p t="4209269" d="3870">Some will feel that he might have said with
greater justice: they are all timid.</p>
<p t="4213139" d="2391">They hide behind customs and opinions.</p>
<p t="4215530" d="6959">At bottom, however, very human being knows
very well that he is in this world just once,</p>
<p t="4222489" d="6230">as something unique, and that no accident,
however strange, will throw together a second</p>
<p t="4228719" d="7280">time into a unity such a curious and diffuse
plurality: he knows it, but he hides it like</p>
<p t="4235999" d="5830">a bad conscience why?</p>
<p t="4241829" d="4571">From fear of his neighbour who insists on
convention and veils himself with it.</p>
<p t="4246400" d="3850">But what is it that compels the individual
human being to fear his neighbour, to think</p>
<p t="4250250" d="3489">and act herd-fashion, and not to be glad of
himself?</p>
<p t="4253739" d="3000">A sense of shame, perhaps, in a few rare cases.</p>
<p t="4256739" d="5451">In the vast majority it is the desire for
comfort, inertia - in short, that inclination</p>
<p t="4262190" d="2460">to laziness of which the traveller spoke.</p>
<p t="4264650" d="5440">He is right: men are even lazier than they
are timorous, and what they fear most is the</p>
<p t="4270090" d="4710">troubles with which any unconditional honesty
and nudity would burden them.</p>
<p t="4274800" d="6060">Only artists hate this slovenly life in borrowed
manners and loosely fitting opinions and unveil</p>
<p t="4280860" d="5920">the secret, everybody&#39;s bad conscience, the
principle that every human being is a unique</p>
<p t="4286780" d="4649">wonder; they dare to show us the human being
as he is, down to the last muscle, himself</p>
<p t="4291429" d="6351">and himself alone even more, that in this
rigorous consistency of his uniqueness he</p>
<p t="4297780" d="5250">is beautiful and worth contemplating, as novel
and as incredible as every work of nature,</p>
<p t="4303030" d="1339">and by no means dull.”</p>
<p t="4304369" d="7120">“When a great thinker despises men, it is
their laziness that he despises: for it is</p>
<p t="4311489" d="4650">on account of this that they have the appearance
of factory products and seem indifferent and</p>
<p t="4316139" d="4531">unworthy of companionship or instruction.</p>
<p t="4320670" d="7099">The human being who does not wish to belong
to the mass must merely cease being comfortable</p>
<p t="4327769" d="8160">with himself; let him follow his conscience
which shouts at him: ‘Be yourself!</p>
<p t="4335929" d="12570">What you are at present doing, opining, and
desiring, that is not really you.’”</p>
<p t="4348499" d="11790">That’s Nietzsche, and Dostoevsky, and existentialism.</p>
<p t="4360289" d="3541">That’s the bare beginning of the thinking.</p>
