<p t="33840" d="6770">As I've mentioned to you before each of the
3 aspects of experience so the things you</p>
<p t="40610" d="7430">know the things you don't know and the fact
of yourself have a very ambivalent underlying</p>
<p t="48040" d="4910">structure both positive and negative so that
the things you don't know are interesting</p>
<p t="52950" d="5760">and compelling in the sources of new information
but also the source of the things that undermine</p>
<p t="58710" d="5000">you both physically and mentally
And the things you know of course your culture</p>
<p t="63710" d="10020">disciplines you and shapes you into a full
person but also at exactly the same time molds</p>
<p t="73730" d="4980">you and crushes you in a particular direction
rather than any of the directions you might</p>
<p t="78710" d="4810">have gone in
And then finally with regards to the individual</p>
<p t="83520" d="6080">we spent a substantial amount of time discussing
the individual's capability capacity to</p>
<p t="89600" d="6220">make order out of chaos and sometimes to make
chaos out of order in the service of a higher</p>
<p t="95820" d="3109">order
And that's all to the good but just like</p>
<p t="98929" d="4321">culture and nature have their negative aspects
so do the individual</p>
<p t="103250" d="7679">And I think personally this is where Christian
mythology in particular comes into its own</p>
<p t="110929" d="7891">I think of all the major religions Christianity
has the most thoroughly developed what you</p>
<p t="118820" d="6030">might describe as formal model of evil and
that model isn't part of the canonical writings</p>
<p t="124850" d="6189">of Christianity say encapsulated in the Bible
but part of cloud of sort of natural mythology</p>
<p t="131039" d="3071">and storytelling that surrounds the canonical
writings</p>
<p t="134110" d="5959">so you could say that although Christainity
and Buddhism have spent a substantial amount</p>
<p t="140069" d="6861">of time developing up a representation of
the hero Christianity in particular has also</p>
<p t="146930" d="6400">spent a substantial amount of time developing
a formal portrait of the figure that stands</p>
<p t="153330" d="3500">in opposition to the hero
and I think the most appropriate term for</p>
<p t="156830" d="8439">that figure who takes multiple forms in mythology
is the adversary because the adversarial spirit</p>
<p t="165269" d="8440">is a spirit that stands in opposition to everything
Stands in opposition to nature stands in opposition</p>
<p t="173709" d="5360">to culture and most specifically stands in
opposition to that aspect of the human being</p>
<p t="179069" d="6750">that's both exploratory and creative
Now the last time we talked I had a chance</p>
<p t="185819" d="7331">to describe to you how the figures of the
adversarial brothers emerged naturally at</p>
<p t="193150" d="5300">the end of genesis as a coda to the story
right Adam and Eve develop self consciousness</p>
<p t="198450" d="5459">they develop knowledge of their own mortality
and death and as the primordial parents of</p>
<p t="203909" d="6390">humanity their first children take the form
of the hostile brothers which is to say that</p>
<p t="210299" d="6291">if you're the child of nature the child of
culture this sort of ultimate parents then</p>
<p t="216590" d="4000">as an individual you take two forms a positive
form and a negative form</p>
<p t="220590" d="5200">and the negative form is characterized in
many ways by the kind of absolute hatred of</p>
<p t="225790" d="7589">the good hatred of the positive form and I
think that you can't understand the full</p>
<p t="233379" d="7610">human propensity for evil without considering
more than the territoriality more than the</p>
<p t="240989" d="3590">innate territoriality of human being
so if you look at animals well animals are</p>
<p t="244579" d="5961">territorial and they fight to preserve their
territory and it's a rational struggle they're</p>
<p t="250540" d="5279">fighting for resources and for a place that
they can that they can operate and live in</p>
<p t="255819" d="4381">and reproduce in efficiently
but human beings are substantively different</p>
<p t="260200" d="6640">from that in that their agonistic conflict
their aggression often seems to be motivated</p>
<p t="266840" d="4250">by something more akin to the pure desire
for destruction rather than for any rational</p>
<p t="271090" d="6270">end whatsoever
And so from that perspective I would say as</p>
<p t="277360" d="6950">an example the fact that Hitler ended up committing
suicide in a bunker beneath Germany's capital</p>
<p t="284310" d="4150">at the end of the second world war when Berlin
was in flames when all of Germany was in flames</p>
<p t="288460" d="3750">and when his country was completely defeated
after tens of millions of people had died</p>
<p t="292210" d="4530">in the conflict including of course the 7
million or so people that were killed in the</p>
<p t="296740" d="1170">Holocaust.</p>
<p t="297910" d="5360">the normal mode of interpretation of that
would be what a terrible defeat for Hitler</p>
<p t="303270" d="6220">but an equally valid and I think um an equally
valid prima facie argument and one I think</p>
<p t="309490" d="4850">that's actually more valid is that wasn't
a defeat for Hitler at all it was precisely</p>
<p t="314340" d="6770">what he was aiming at right from the beginning
because his mode of being was intensely adversarial</p>
<p t="321110" d="4880">And I would also say that it's certainly
possible that the full nature of these motivations</p>
<p t="325990" d="5780">weren't even necessarily clear to him As they
unfolded across time during the second world</p>
<p t="331770" d="4660">war no more than the full motivations of any
human being are necessarily accessible to</p>
<p t="336430" d="2630">them as they act out whatever it is that they
act out</p>
<p t="339060" d="5859">so Carl Jung says for example that we act
out great mythological stories that doesn't</p>
<p t="344919" d="3791">necessarily mean you know the story just means
you act it out</p>
<p t="348710" d="5310">so for example you see people whose lives
are repetitive bouts of tragedy and what they're</p>
<p t="354020" d="5280">acting out is a tragic story and they know
it insofar as they're actually acting it out</p>
<p t="359300" d="4970">but they don't necessarily have an explicit
model of the relationship between their patterns</p>
<p t="364270" d="2780">of behaviour and the constantly tragic outcome
they produce</p>
<p t="367050" d="4679">Well that doesn't even necessarily mean
that what they're doing isn't voluntary Because</p>
<p t="371729" d="4720">things can be voluntary even if you don't
understand them fully</p>
<p t="376449" d="4530">There's an aspect to the human psyche that's
a “nest of vipers” so to speak because</p>
<p t="380979" d="3900">you can't necessarily trust what you see
and that means not only when you're looking</p>
<p t="384879" d="3540">at someone else say but even when you're looking
in the mirror you can't be sure that what</p>
<p t="388419" d="3220">you say you're doing is exactly what you're
doing.</p>
<p t="391639" d="8020">Your motivations aren't transparent and they
may not even be clear</p>
<p t="399659" d="5621">so I suppose the idea that lurks behind this
formalization is that freedom of choice is</p>
<p t="405280" d="8180">such a good that one of its subsidiary necessities
which is that there has to be a polar distinction</p>
<p t="413460" d="5609">between good and evil is worth having freedom
is so important that it justifies the distinction</p>
<p t="419069" d="4171">between good and evil
and I think that art I think that's a reasonable</p>
<p t="423240" d="7760">way to presume It's reasonable to presume
that that's the manner in which experience</p>
<p t="431000" d="2880">is actually structured and there's complex
reasons for that</p>
<p t="433880" d="5969">one would be that under the most optimal circumstances
which is something we'll talk about as this</p>
<p t="439849" d="4500">proceeds to a close that means in a sense
you can have your cake and eat it too</p>
<p t="444349" d="5451">Which means the potential existence of good
and evil allows for freedom of choice And</p>
<p t="449800" d="4820">then if the choice is always towards the good
then you have the benefits of freedom of choice</p>
<p t="454620" d="4329">plus the benefits of the good the only price
you have to pay is the constant possibility</p>
<p t="458949" d="1000">of evil.</p>
<p t="459949" d="6291">It's very much like the structure of Christianity
so you have the highest god who's whose</p>
<p t="466240" d="4389">highest son is Christ but you have the figure
of the Satan lurking in the background who's</p>
<p t="470629" d="3630">also got a filial relationship with the highest
god.</p>
<p t="474259" d="4501">and it makes for a confusing kind of theology
because in many situations of course Christ</p>
<p t="478760" d="5659">is identified specifically with God the father
but Satan always lurks in the background and</p>
<p t="484419" d="6250">his existential status is indeterminate because
since God is everything then it's very difficult</p>
<p t="490669" d="4150">to make the case that the evil spirit isn't
a derivative of God it's not easy thing</p>
<p t="494819" d="5130">to get straightened out rationally
and I think Milton in Paradise Lost has a</p>
<p t="499949" d="5620">very good attempt good attempt to explain
exactly what this might mean how there could</p>
<p t="505569" d="4931">be an overarching transcendent power And there
could be two subordinate elements to that</p>
<p t="510500" d="6950">one evil and one good without destroying the
idea that God as such is good and without</p>
<p t="517450" d="5779">eradicating the reality of evil a very very
complex argument to make</p>
<p t="523229" d="6691">Now the notion of evil is also very very complex
idea so if you look at arguments that support</p>
<p t="529920" d="3990">Atheism and I've mentioned some of these like
Ivan's argument and the Brothers Karamazov</p>
<p t="533910" d="6700">where Ivan says well the world as such experience
as such must be evil because it's predicated</p>
<p t="540610" d="4420">on the blood of innocence the suffering of
children the fact that there's vast injustices</p>
<p t="545030" d="5410">in the world is indicative that there's no
such thing as a good god or to speak in personified</p>
<p t="550440" d="6330">terms is evidence that the structure of experience
as such is untenable morally it shouldn't</p>
<p t="556770" d="1000">be.</p>
<p t="557770" d="4360">Because it's predicated on suffering
Jeffrey Burton Russell who's written whole</p>
<p t="562130" d="5070">series of books on the nature of evil makes
a very clear distinction between different</p>
<p t="567200" d="5070">categories of terrible events that I think
help bring this into clarity so imagine this</p>
<p t="572270" d="4980">imagine first that it's useful to make a
distinction between tragedy and evil.</p>
<p t="577250" d="6270">Okay now tragedy is when the bad befalls the
good an earthquake is tragic or disease is</p>
<p t="583520" d="1000">tragic.</p>
<p t="584520" d="3450">now it's easy to regard a disease or an
earthquake as evil as well but the problem</p>
<p t="587970" d="2530">with that is there doesn't seem to be any
motivation to it</p>
<p t="590500" d="4640">And so it's more likely it's more reasonable
to think something like well people are vulnerable</p>
<p t="595140" d="6270">and have to be vulnerable in order to give
existence a viewpoint one of the consequences</p>
<p t="601410" d="4500">of their vulnerability is that they're susceptible
to tragedy</p>
<p t="605910" d="7120">Okay If their vulnerability is a precondition
for being then the fact that they're susceptible</p>
<p t="613030" d="6970">to tragedy isn't necessarily an evil it's
just a consequence of their limitation.</p>
<p t="620000" d="3560">Then you say well what constitutes evil if
you can't put earthquakes and diseases and</p>
<p t="623560" d="1700">so forth into that category.</p>
<p t="625260" d="5220">Well then it seems to be something more dependent
on choice which is the argument that Eliade</p>
<p t="630480" d="4280">is making
Say the world does all sorts of terrible things</p>
<p t="634760" d="5460">to people but there are frequent - it's
frequently the case that people act in such</p>
<p t="640220" d="2550">a way that make things worse rather than better.</p>
<p t="642770" d="6170">right so if you look at the consequences of
the rise to power of the Nazis for example</p>
<p t="648940" d="4190">doesn't seem reasonable to put the Nazi
concentration camp in the same category from</p>
<p t="653130" d="8000">an ethical perspective as the earthquake
Because the earthquake is an emergent consequence</p>
<p t="661130" d="3430">of the rules that govern physical existence.</p>
<p t="664560" d="4670">Whereas the Nazi death camp is something that
was planned it didn't have to be it seems</p>
<p t="669230" d="2300">to be an aspect of choice.</p>
<p t="671530" d="5300">And this seems to be the idea that's lurking
underneath both this mythology and Eliade's</p>
<p t="676830" d="4880">comment on it it's the mere fact that the
world is terrible does not mean that it's</p>
<p t="681710" d="2070">evil
but then when you look at specifically human</p>
<p t="683780" d="3950">actions there's this aspect of twisted choice
that Frye also makes much of</p>
<p t="687730" d="6270">He says if you look at the structure of human
history and you try to explain why it has</p>
<p t="694000" d="5620">such a bloody and terrible course it doesn't
seem sufficient just to attribute it say to</p>
<p t="699620" d="5920">the conditions of existence or to ignorance
it seems more like there's a force behind</p>
<p t="705540" d="2500">it so to speak manifest say in every individual.</p>
<p t="708040" d="5330">But actually aiming at the suffering instead
of just allowing it to happen or instead of</p>
<p t="713370" d="3970">not stepping in to stop it but actually aiming
at it</p>
<p t="717340" d="5440">Now so let's take a look at the stories.</p>
<p t="722780" d="5740">And let's take a look at the leading figures
so we know for example that the figure of</p>
<p t="728520" d="3170">Satan in Christianity is associated with a
number of strange forms</p>
<p t="731690" d="6350">right the first association we know if is
that he's associated with the… with the</p>
<p t="738040" d="5020">dragon and in the garden of Eden
right so there's and so that there's a profound</p>
<p t="743060" d="3740">ambivalence in Christianity about the meaning
of the opening act of Genesis</p>
<p t="746800" d="4060">because on the one hand you have when Adam
and Eve are still profoundly unconscious they</p>
<p t="750860" d="5240">don't suffer But they're profoundly unconscious
right they're not self conscious they're not</p>
<p t="756100" d="3540">aware of themselves so in many ways they're
still animals</p>
<p t="759640" d="2320">So there's a Gnostic line of speculation.</p>
<p t="761960" d="6280">The Gnostics were a Christian sect that believed
that redemption could at least partly be attained</p>
<p t="768240" d="5500">by understanding rather than just faith
The Gnostics believed that the serpent that</p>
<p t="773740" d="6230">tempted Adam and Eve towards self consciousness
was a more developed aspect of God than the</p>
<p t="779970" d="4220">God that had created Adam and Eve to begin
with because the unconsciousness that characterized</p>
<p t="784190" d="5480">Adam and Eve was too underdeveloped to be
perfect and so they had to be tempted forward</p>
<p t="789670" d="5360">into a more fully developed consciousness.
and so although classical Christianity associated</p>
<p t="795030" d="5740">the serpent in the tree with Lucifer who's
the bringer of light who's Satan the Gnostic</p>
<p t="800770" d="2550">thread of reasoning said well wait a minute
it's not that simple</p>
<p t="803320" d="4740">because yeah self-consciousness makes you
aware of death and vulnerability and knocks</p>
<p t="808060" d="4350">you out into the profane world but there's
an aspect of it that looks like enlightenment</p>
<p t="812410" d="4640">- and you know this already in your own lives
because often when you believe something and</p>
<p t="817050" d="4850">you're unconsciously convinced of the adequacy
of that model and then you find that it's</p>
<p t="821900" d="3730">not sufficient right and so you crumble in
disappointment</p>
<p t="825630" d="4170">you put your trust in someone and you find
out say they're not worthy of that trust and</p>
<p t="829800" d="6200">that the evidence that enlightens you breaks
that frame of reference and makes you collapse</p>
<p t="836000" d="4700">you think that's a terrible thing you can't
help but feel that as a real betrayal and</p>
<p t="840700" d="4690">as an act even of evil but then a year later
two years later you might look back and God</p>
<p t="845390" d="5420">you know I really needed that I really needed
that lesson because as a consequence of learning</p>
<p t="850810" d="4000">that I'm much more mature and much more likely
to establish stable relationships</p>
<p t="854810" d="5800">and so it's easy to see that from one perspective
something can be terrible then from another</p>
<p t="860610" d="3950">it might not be terrible at all
and even in classic Christianity you get this</p>
<p t="864560" d="5580">strange ambivalence about the events in Genesis
that runs something like this</p>
<p t="870140" d="5540">Well yes it was an act of the most evil spirit
the spirit of enlightenment the spirit of</p>
<p t="875680" d="5700">rationality the bringer of light Lucifer to
knock Adam and Eve out of their transcendental</p>
<p t="881380" d="6100">unconsciousness and to start history it was
an evil act but on the other hand it was also</p>
<p t="887480" d="4450">the pre-condition for the later emergence
of Christ and as far as the Christians are</p>
<p t="891930" d="5370">concerned that's the greatest event in history
so without this initial opening act this tragic</p>
<p t="897300" d="5440">opening act there'd be no reason the whole
redemptive story and therefore considered</p>
<p t="902740" d="6520">from the perspective of the total story the
opening tragedy cannot purely be considered</p>
<p t="909260" d="5060">evil
Very very complicated line of reasoning</p>
<p t="914320" d="6240">Now the other thing you see here and I think
this relates back to our initial map is and</p>
<p t="920560" d="4120">this also helps you understand the way people
think now I said all ready that it's really</p>
<p t="924680" d="6210">easy to confuse tragedy and evil right
okay so what that means is that it's real</p>
<p t="930890" d="3520">easy to confuse the negative aspect of the
unknown with evil</p>
<p t="934410" d="4160">And likewise it's very easy to confuse the
negative aspect of culture with evil your</p>
<p t="938570" d="4600">own culture the tyrannical aspect of it or
the culture of other people</p>
<p t="943170" d="4630">So it's very easy, for example, for us to
demonize the foreigner and that's basically</p>
<p t="947800" d="5690">because there's a part of our mind that presumes
that all things that strike us negatively</p>
<p t="953490" d="5560">all things that produce negative emotion on
our part like fear are the same thing</p>
<p t="959050" d="6330">So there's a blurry category of evil that's
all terrible natural things all terrible social</p>
<p t="965380" d="7180">things and then whatever nastiness the individual
can generate among themselves It's much</p>
<p t="972560" d="5350">more useful to draw a clear distinction between
these different categories.</p>
<p t="977910" d="8170">beause that clarity of thought can help you
focus in most specifically on those things</p>
<p t="986080" d="5300">that the individual is responsible for in
terms of turning the world to waste</p>
<p t="991380" d="8150">so milton says this figure of satan lucifer
the light bringer always associated with rationality</p>
<p t="999530" d="4910">Milton presents him as a remarkable creature
right he's the highest angel in God's</p>
<p t="1004440" d="6760">heavenly hierarchy he's Christ's brother
in a similar mythological vein he's the</p>
<p t="1011200" d="1810">most powerful angel that ever lived.</p>
<p t="1013010" d="4910">So at least in the opening stages of this
act Satan is presented as something absolutely</p>
<p t="1017920" d="4260">remarkable
Now the problem is here his very remarkableness</p>
<p t="1022180" d="5550">starts to work against him
And what happens is that as he grows in power</p>
<p t="1027730" d="7030">and strength in this heavenly hierarchy he
starts to become convinced that that omniscient</p>
<p t="1034760" d="6750">himself whatever that transcendent figure
is is unnecessary so the idea is that whatever</p>
<p t="1041510" d="7750">Satan represents decides because of his own
pride his own belief in his own sufficiency</p>
<p t="1049260" d="5830">that the transcendent can be eradicated from
consideration and the way Milton presents</p>
<p t="1055090" d="3589">that as a revolution in heaven fundamentally.</p>
<p t="1058679" d="4261">So imagine that the story is something like
this.</p>
<p t="1062940" d="7430">Well, George Kelly way back in like 1955 noted
that what human beings like more than anything</p>
<p t="1070370" d="3600">else really when they get right down to it
is to be right</p>
<p t="1073970" d="1829">Why?</p>
<p t="1075799" d="4201">Well it's a pain to be wrong right because
if you're wrong then whatever structure that</p>
<p t="1080000" d="6009">you're using to conjure up the world has to
dissolve but then you have to do a lot of</p>
<p t="1086009" d="4790">really aggravating work exploratory work and
creative work to put it back together</p>
<p t="1090799" d="4771">And during the time before you put it back
together then you're flooded with negative</p>
<p t="1095570" d="4309">motivational states right you don't know
which way is up Metaphorically speaking</p>
<p t="1099879" d="5150">So we don't like to be you don't like
not to be right and so what does that mean</p>
<p t="1105029" d="4721">Well psychologists know that people have a
very strong confirmatory bias which basically</p>
<p t="1109750" d="4960">means that if you bring a frame of reference
to bear on the world the probability is very</p>
<p t="1114710" d="7390">high that you will look for confirming evidence
and you discount disconfirming evidence</p>
<p t="1122100" d="4250">Now the other thing that is characteristic
of great figures of evil like Satan is the</p>
<p t="1126350" d="6880">tendency to lie so Satan is prince of lie
now what does that mean exactly?</p>
<p t="1133230" d="9460">So, TS Eliot wrote this poem called the Cocktail
Hour he talks about this woman who goes into</p>
<p t="1142690" d="4380">a psychiatric treatment the woman says to
the psychiatrist I'm telling you I really</p>
<p t="1147070" d="4170">really hope there's something wrong with me
Because I'm having a miserable time of it</p>
<p t="1151240" d="3039">And as far as I can tell there's only two
options here.</p>
<p t="1154279" d="5091">Either I'm okay and I'm having a miserable
time because the world is terrible which case</p>
<p t="1159370" d="5049">nothing I can do about it or there's something
wrong with me at some level of analysis that</p>
<p t="1164419" d="5681">I don't really comprehend and although that's
a painful option I'm really hoping it's</p>
<p t="1170100" d="3970">true because if there's something wrong with
me possibly I can fix it and if there's something</p>
<p t="1174070" d="7430">wrong with the structure of the world well
what's there to do about that</p>
<p t="1181500" d="3549">Often what you see in psychotherapy is a battle
between those two perspectives going on in</p>
<p t="1185049" d="6701">the minds of the client that the client is
in a situation where they're repetetively</p>
<p t="1191750" d="1059">facing tragedy.</p>
<p t="1192809" d="4631">they have a specific viewpoint about the world
but the viewpoint might be well when it comes</p>
<p t="1197440" d="3479">right down to it you really can't trust
other people And they have all sorts of reasons</p>
<p t="1200919" d="3850">for believing that they abused his children
or they had a bad developmental history a</p>
<p t="1204769" d="4510">number of relationships that hadn't gone well
they have all the facts at their disposal</p>
<p t="1209279" d="4020">to justify that particular perspective
but the truth of the matter is that as long</p>
<p t="1213299" d="5321">as they hold onto that belief and won't
let it go and no wonder they won't they're</p>
<p t="1218620" d="3130">gonna continue to suffer
and part of what you always do to someone</p>
<p t="1221750" d="3779">in therapy saying you know yeah you got a
pretty coherent view of the world and all</p>
<p t="1225529" d="5350">that and I can understand why you'd like to
cram the whole world into that coherent perspective</p>
<p t="1230879" d="3591">but the truth of the matter is as long as
you hold onto that and won't sacrifice it</p>
<p t="1234470" d="4929">won't go through this terrible period of
dissolution it's always gonna produce this</p>
<p t="1239399" d="5350">same tragic consequences
so as long as you hold onto your belief rigidly</p>
<p t="1244749" d="3331">everything around you is gonna go from bad
to worse.</p>
<p t="1248080" d="6219">Northrop Frye says with regards to such states
that “a demonic fall as Milton presents</p>
<p t="1254299" d="5191">it involves defiance of and rivalry with God
rather than simple disobedience and hence</p>
<p t="1259490" d="5529">the demonic society is a sustained and systematic
parody of the divine one associated with devils</p>
<p t="1265019" d="6490">or fallen angels because it seems far beyond
normal human capacities in its powers We read</p>
<p t="1271509" d="4731">of ascending and descending angels on Jacob's
and Plato's ladders and similarly there</p>
<p t="1276240" d="4809">seem to be demonic reinforcements in heathen
life that account for the almost superhuman</p>
<p t="1281049" d="6200">grandeur of the heathen empires especially
just before they fall Two particularly notable</p>
<p t="1287249" d="4441">passages in the Old Testament prophets linked
to this theme are the denunciation of Babylon</p>
<p t="1291690" d="7569">in Isaiah 14 and of Tyre in Ezekiel 28 Babylon
is associated with Lucifer the morning star</p>
<p t="1299259" d="3500">who said to himself ‘I will be like the
Most High'.</p>
<p t="1302759" d="4111">okay so let's translate that into modern
language and forget about Babylon let's</p>
<p t="1306870" d="3750">take a Soviet Union for example Instead and
let's say something like this</p>
<p t="1310620" d="5330">";I will be like the most high"; well first
of all it's not difficult to read Stalin</p>
<p t="1315950" d="4050">into that from a personal perspective but
then it's more complicated than that because</p>
<p t="1320000" d="5549">you can't blame the Soviet Union on Stalin
When the wall fell down we know that one third</p>
<p t="1325549" d="4691">of east Germans were KGB informers you can't
blame that on Stalin you have to blame that</p>
<p t="1330240" d="3490">on the one third of the east Germans who were
KGB informers right</p>
<p t="1333730" d="5699">it's this totalitarian presupposition presumption
is distributed through the whole society</p>
<p t="1339429" d="5210">there's a leader and a hierarchy and all that
but they're not the people to be identified</p>
<p t="1344639" d="4451">with the fact of the totalitarian state
It's distributed through the whole society</p>
<p t="1349090" d="6039">and it's precisely this it's what I don't
know I don't need I don't need what I</p>
<p t="1355129" d="7601">don't know
one of the things I really liked about this</p>
<p t="1362730" d="5990">sort of Christian metaphysical take on the
problem of evil is that it… it adopts strange</p>
<p t="1368720" d="4270">first principles
like if you're an empirical scientist it's</p>
<p t="1372990" d="3029">very difficult to come to terms with the notion
of free choice</p>
<p t="1376019" d="3211">Right because there are no deterministic models
of free choice we don't know how that might</p>
<p t="1379230" d="1069">occur although.</p>
<p t="1380299" d="4691">if it seems to be a reasonable phenomenological
observation that if there's anything true</p>
<p t="1384990" d="5170">about existence about the facts of existence
as it's subjectively construed the fact</p>
<p t="1390160" d="4950">that you seem to have the faculty of choice
seems paramount or primary now…</p>
<p t="1395110" d="4340">one might say well that's just a delusion
and we know that because our deterministic</p>
<p t="1399450" d="4750">models have been so powerful
Or one might say well alternatively we're</p>
<p t="1404200" d="4030">going to presume the subjective experience
to be true and saying well our deterministic</p>
<p t="1408230" d="3919">models just aren't sophisticated enough and
there's no real reason to choose between either</p>
<p t="1412149" d="3980">of those on a name a priori basis right they're
perhaps equally plausible</p>
<p t="1416129" d="5150">And we also might note the deterministic perspective
of course that if you go down far enough in</p>
<p t="1421279" d="4740">your analysis of physical structures down
to the quantum level say then deterministic</p>
<p t="1426019" d="3780">models don't hold at all
So determinism have its limits at the lower</p>
<p t="1429799" d="4260">end or higher resolution end of physical inquiry
I have no idea what that might mean for free</p>
<p t="1434059" d="3381">choice
It just means that our level of analysis that</p>
<p t="1437440" d="9359">deterministic models do not describe
Christianity takes the stance that the subjective</p>
<p t="1446799" d="5781">the subjective sense of freedom is accurate
And then tries to build the world from that</p>
<p t="1452580" d="5789">point It presumes that's in axiomatic principle
and so you have God in Milton's Paradise</p>
<p t="1458369" d="6380">Lost saying with regards both to Lucifer and
to human beings who are fallen he says ";some</p>
<p t="1464749" d="5780">will fall he and his faithless progeny speaking
of human beings whose fault whose but his</p>
<p t="1470529" d="6360">own ingrate he had of me all he could've I
made him just and right sufficient to have</p>
<p t="1476889" d="4971">stood though free to fall ";
I like that I think that makes a fair bit</p>
<p t="1481860" d="3889">of sense to me
I started to understand this most particularly</p>
<p t="1485749" d="4581">as a consequence of reading Carl Jung because
Jung has this really interesting notion and</p>
<p t="1490330" d="4230">I think it's tied to the idea in Genesis
that as soon as Adam becomes self conscious</p>
<p t="1494560" d="3609">he hides from God
So what if it was this and you can take an</p>
<p t="1498169" d="6071">evolutionary tack on this too What if it was
this what if it was the case that if you never</p>
<p t="1504240" d="6289">turned away from any phenomenological evidence
then you build a personality that would be</p>
<p t="1510529" d="3860">strong enough to withstand tragedy
What if that was the case So the idea here</p>
<p t="1514389" d="5490">being let's say you are the person who notes
that his or her friends don't exactly trust</p>
<p t="1519879" d="3400">me, What do you do?</p>
<p t="1523279" d="3380">Well to hide away you just walk away and then
of course you never learn anything</p>
<p t="1526659" d="4480">But let's say by contrast you say well no
the first time you get any evidence that you're</p>
<p t="1531139" d="6411">not 100% trusted you say look I got this pang
in my heart saying the communication between</p>
<p t="1537550" d="4540">you and I is not exactly straight
Now something's going on here either you</p>
<p t="1542090" d="4659">haven't got your frame of reference with regards
to me right or there's something wrong with</p>
<p t="1546749" d="3930">the way I'm looking at the world Those are
the options so let's have it out</p>
<p t="1550679" d="5051">You got this attitude and it's doing it's
hurting me Tell me what you have to say and</p>
<p t="1555730" d="4419">I'll tell you what I have to say and we'll
exchange this pattern of information and as</p>
<p t="1560149" d="4600">a consequence we're both gonna walk away
a little bit more well put together</p>
<p t="1564749" d="6411">God says yeah yeah people get disturbed and
twisted and bent and warped but that's their</p>
<p t="1571160" d="3879">own problem fundamentally because they have
this capacity just to turn away.</p>
<p t="1575039" d="5161">And as they turn away they get weaker and
as they get weaker the world gets worse around</p>
<p t="1580200" d="3530">them because they can't deal with it and
they keep making mistakes and that's a terrible</p>
<p t="1583730" d="4829">consequence and all that but if they just
wouldn't turn away to begin with then there'd</p>
<p t="1588559" d="3441">be no problem
And there wouldn't be no problem because</p>
<p t="1592000" d="4159">the world would stop being tragic because
the world's tragic right I mean there you</p>
<p t="1596159" d="5631">are little and vulnerable and you know things
can roll right over you the world can demolish</p>
<p t="1601790" d="5160">you but the idea would be instead that you
could handle it without becoming corrupted</p>
<p t="1606950" d="7299">and that would be sufficient
so the idea would be it's a tough situation</p>
<p t="1614249" d="4870">all things considered but it's also an interesting
and compelling and beautiful one and it maybe</p>
<p t="1619119" d="5150">that if you didn't turn away the interesting
and beautiful and compelling aspect would</p>
<p t="1624269" d="2600">overwhelm the tragic aspect and that would
be fine.</p>
