<p t="9040" d="1520">I should tell you first</p>
<p t="11900" d="1680">about the genesis of this</p>
<p t="14480" d="3040">theory I suppose is the right way of putting it</p>
<p t="23880" d="1600">when I was about your age</p>
<p t="26880" d="1280">that was back in the</p>
<p t="29180" d="840">early 80's</p>
<p t="30720" d="1600">or thereabouts</p>
<p t="35320" d="4800">and this was particularly true around 1984 but it was true before that too</p>
<p t="40780" d="2240">every generation has its worries</p>
<p t="43720" d="2760">real or imagined</p>
<p t="47060" d="1200">the primary worry</p>
<p t="49140" d="3800">for people of my generation was nuclear war</p>
<p t="53860" d="3240">and you know it was a genuine worry</p>
<p t="59380" d="2560">at one point many years later</p>
<p t="62380" d="1760">I went down to Arizona</p>
<p t="64700" d="3480">to visit an ICBM, a decommissioned ICBM</p>
<p t="68460" d="1720">nuclear missile silo</p>
<p t="70420" d="4960">and ICBM, intercontinental ballistic missile were, very large rockets</p>
<p t="75760" d="720">right they</p>
<p t="76880" d="2580">flew at, they could fly half way around the world</p>
<p t="80880" d="3040">it was deep underground and behind very thick</p>
<p t="83940" d="3840">steel doors, it was light green you know that pastel green</p>
<p t="87780" d="2760">that everyone seemed to like in the 1950's</p>
<p t="90900" d="3400">it was like pastel green Star Trek console</p>
<p t="94300" d="1460">that's what it looked like</p>
<p t="96140" d="740">and ah,</p>
<p t="97440" d="960">so we went down</p>
<p t="98400" d="3740">out in the yard, it was in the desert,  out in the yard there was a very</p>
<p t="102780" d="960">I would say</p>
<p t="106940" d="1440">magical object</p>
<p t="108940" d="1600">for lack of a better word</p>
<p t="111900" d="1680">and that was the nose cone</p>
<p t="114460" d="1800">for the ICBM</p>
<p t="117360" d="1440">and it was quite big</p>
<p t="119120" d="3660">about that big, about that high, pointed like the point of a bullet</p>
<p t="123100" d="2800">about ¾'s of an inch thick, plastic</p>
<p t="126080" d="1520">you know kind of a resin</p>
<p t="127780" d="2560">and it was designed to melt on re-entry</p>
<p t="130340" d="1740">so that was just sitting there</p>
<p t="132320" d="1200">so that was fairly</p>
<p t="134320" d="2720">thought provoking, let's put it that way</p>
<p t="137560" d="1680">and then we went into</p>
<p t="139500" d="1360">the missile silo</p>
<p t="141200" d="1560">interestingly enough</p>
<p t="142760" d="3560">appended to the front of it, it had been decommissioned under Regan, by the way</p>
<p t="146840" d="3360">in the front of it there was a museum</p>
<p t="150680" d="700">with</p>
<p t="152160" d="3320">artifacts from the 1980's featuring Reagan</p>
<p t="156240" d="3480">and Gorbachev meeting multiple times</p>
<p t="160080" d="2040">and it was staffed by these</p>
<p t="162320" d="1240">Southern</p>
<p t="163560" d="4480">these Americans from the South who were grandparent age and they were</p>
<p t="168040" d="2080">and they were just super friendly</p>
<p t="170200" d="3240">and you know , they were happy to be in the museum, and it was like going to visit</p>
<p t="173440" d="1960">your grandma's nuclear missile silo</p>
<p t="176540" d="5000">and so it was jarring you know, because it was obviously a portentous</p>
<p t="184000" d="5520">place, and yet it was conjoined with hospitality and welcoming</p>
<p t="190040" d="1920">it was surreal in that manner</p>
<p t="192540" d="1600">anyways we went into the</p>
<p t="195580" d="1160">into the silo</p>
<p t="198380" d="1600">and they ran us through a</p>
<p t="200700" d="2640">simulated launch, so imagine</p>
<p t="204080" d="7760">a panel like this made out of metal except twice as long with another one of these things at the other end 16 feet across or so</p>
<p t="214200" d="2240">basically 1950's technology</p>
<p t="218000" d="4440">but updated and then imagine what you had to do to launch it</p>
<p t="222440" d="5480">was that there was a guy with a key and there was  another guy with a key and if I remember correctly the keys were around their necks</p>
<p t="227920" d="2860">although I don't think that they were stored around their necks permanently but</p>
<p t="230860" d="3920">and so to launch the missile you had to put the key in the lock</p>
<p t="235440" d="2600">both of you that was the safety</p>
<p t="238260" d="2280">precaution, had to be two of you</p>
<p t="240580" d="3680">put the key in the lock and hold it for 10 seconds and then</p>
<p t="244260" d="6160">away the missile goes and it wasn't as big, the missile wasn't as big as the rockets that went to the moon</p>
<p t="250700" d="660">but</p>
<p t="251360" d="4320">but it was plenty big you know the silo itself would have easily been</p>
<p t="256180" d="2240">as wide as this room is</p>
<p t="258420" d="4780">and perhaps larger and many, many, story's tall, you know because it was nested underground</p>
<p t="263840" d="3360">so they ran us through a simulated launch which was</p>
<p t="269380" d="4160">surreal, I would say and then they told us that</p>
<p t="273880" d="2880">someone asked, that the keys were in once</p>
<p t="277420" d="2320">now, they wouldn't tell us when but</p>
<p t="279740" d="3840">you know that would have been during the Cuban missile crisis</p>
<p t="283620" d="3400">because, we were that close</p>
<p t="287660" d="4720">and we were close again at other times, although perhaps not that close</p>
<p t="292480" d="2480">and there seemed to be another peak of</p>
<p t="296460" d="3280">conflict, in 1984</p>
<p t="300100" d="2920">when there was a movie showed at that time called</p>
<p t="303020" d="720">“The Day After”</p>
<p t="304020" d="1620">which at that time</p>
<p t="306660" d="3920">garnered more views than any movie ever had on TV, and it was</p>
<p t="311680" d="880">a story about</p>
<p t="312560" d="4300">the aftermath of a nuclear war and the people that were left and it was</p>
<p t="317280" d="1440">pretty realistic and</p>
<p t="319720" d="2920">and pretty frightening,  it, it turned out</p>
<p t="323380" d="2200">as I found out later that</p>
<p t="326200" d="4080">that movie was one of things that influenced Ronald Reagan to</p>
<p t="330280" d="3940">put pressure on or negotiate with the Soviets depending on how</p>
<p t="334300" d="1040">you look at it</p>
<p t="336180" d="500">and so</p>
<p t="337800" d="2000">well then you know 5 years later</p>
<p t="341100" d="3360">the Soviet union collapsed, no one saw that coming</p>
<p t="345940" d="4400">and it really didn't collapse in 1989 in some sense, you know, like</p>
<p t="350800" d="3120">a huge machine like that</p>
<p t="354440" d="4540">doesn't fall apart all at once, it falls apart over time and then at some point it just</p>
<p t="358980" d="2060">becomes unsustainable and topples</p>
<p t="362540" d="4280">and  you know, it's like they lost faith in their doctrine</p>
<p t="367940" d="1600">and for good reason</p>
<p t="372780" d="880">you know that</p>
<p t="376240" d="1360">the system in Russia</p>
<p t="378160" d="2680">the Soviet Union, which was a collection of states,</p>
<p t="380920" d="640">an empire</p>
<p t="383420" d="2960">and the system that Mao establish in China and</p>
<p t="386480" d="2480">the system that still exists in Korea</p>
<p t="389680" d="2040">as a remnant of the cold war</p>
<p t="393680" d="2880">and systems in South East Asia and in Africa</p>
<p t="397080" d="1520">were all predicated on</p>
<p t="399020" d="2000">Marxist presuppositions</p>
<p t="403600" d="3040">presuppositions that were Utopian in nature</p>
<p t="406840" d="660">and that</p>
<p t="409020" d="3040">and that posited a Utopian future where</p>
<p t="412580" d="2960">property was held in common and everyone had</p>
<p t="415800" d="500">enough</p>
<p t="416560" d="3280">and everyone was called upon to do what they could</p>
<p t="420160" d="1760">ight, from each according</p>
<p t="421920" d="2560">to his ability, to each according to his need</p>
<p t="424480" d="2680">which is a lovely sentiment and you can imagine</p>
<p t="427720" d="1760">how it would be attractive</p>
<p t="429480" d="2360">even intellectually, because of course</p>
<p t="431980" d="3080">other systems, all other systems</p>
<p t="435480" d="2680">produce vast disparities in income</p>
<p t="438620" d="2880">it's like a natural law, that's actually</p>
<p t="442160" d="3600">governed by, you can model it</p>
<p t="445760" d="6520">with a distribution called the Pareto distribution, and the Pareto distribution looks like this</p>
<p t="453320" d="4700">it doesn't look like a normal distribution, a lot of you guys have been told about, not,  normal distributions and how</p>
<p t="458420" d="980">many things</p>
<p t="459600" d="5040">many things follow on normal distribution, most things, but that's really</p>
<p t="465020" d="960">a limited case</p>
<p t="466720" d="3200">you can understand a Pareto distribution if you</p>
<p t="469920" d="2420">you've all played Monopoly I presume</p>
<p t="473100" d="1360">at the beginning</p>
<p t="474460" d="2440">everyone has the same amount of money</p>
<p t="476940" d="3440">we will include property, the same amount of wealth</p>
<p t="480380" d="3620">and then what happens as the game progresses, and really as a function of chance</p>
<p t="484000" d="3520">I mean, I know that you have to use a head a little bit in Monopoly but</p>
<p t="487520" d="3360">the basic rule is just buy everything you can get your hands on</p>
<p t="491900" d="2880">and then trade meanly, something like that</p>
<p t="494980" d="3280">so at the beginning everybody has the same amount</p>
<p t="498520" d="2080">and then as you begin to play</p>
<p t="500600" d="4280">if you had enough players you would develop a normal distribution</p>
<p t="504880" d="1740">because some people would win</p>
<p t="506620" d="4240">relatively consistently and some players lose relatively consistently</p>
<p t="510860" d="2640">and so the money starts to be distributed</p>
<p t="513540" d="2000">in a normal distribution, but</p>
<p t="515880" d="4240">the thing about money, and the thing about lots of things</p>
<p t="521800" d="1600">is that zero is involved</p>
<p t="524240" d="2400">and zero is a weird place</p>
<p t="526780" d="3760">because if you are playing a trading game and you hit zero</p>
<p t="530940" d="1120">then you're done</p>
<p t="532680" d="3920">and so, and it is very hard to recover from zero, and you know</p>
<p t="536600" d="3180">it's really hard to recover, you know when you are doomed in Monopoly</p>
<p t="539780" d="3700">you know, you, you can tell, you've got some resources but</p>
<p t="543480" d="3740">there is going to be some crisis when you land on some hotel</p>
<p t="547220" d="2740">and you are going to get wiped out, you know it, so</p>
<p t="549960" d="4060">there is a point at which you're headed for zero even if you have</p>
<p t="554260" d="720">something</p>
<p t="554980" d="2240">you know and you might be rescued by,</p>
<p t="559480" d="500">luck,</p>
<p t="562440" d="2080">but you know when you are doomed</p>
<p t="565840" d="3280">So what happens as you continue to play Monopoly,</p>
<p t="569860" d="2400">more and more people stack up at zero</p>
<p t="573360" d="2400">and fewer and fewer people</p>
<p t="575760" d="1520">have more and more money</p>
<p t="577620" d="1600">and when the game is over</p>
<p t="579560" d="3520">every person has no money and one person has all of it,</p>
<p t="583140" d="1840">now the funny thing about that is</p>
<p t="584980" d="3340">in some sense that is how trading games work,</p>
<p t="588360" d="4720">you know, you got, you might wonder why there is inequality in a society</p>
<p t="593080" d="3340">and it is easy to consider that it's because the society is corrupt</p>
<p t="596980" d="880">and perhaps,</p>
<p t="598640" d="3440">you know, society is somewhat or horribly corrupt,</p>
<p t="602860" d="2240">that is the variation, there is no</p>
<p t="605100" d="2080">society that is not without its criminal</p>
<p t="607760" d="2240">element, its fixed element</p>
<p t="610680" d="920">anyways</p>
<p t="613040" d="5760">trading games tend to produce a Pareto distribution so that very many have very little</p>
<p t="619420" d="2960">and a tiny minority have a tremendous amount</p>
<p t="622580" d="2720">that's the 1% that you hear about, right,</p>
<p t="626400" d="2160">and the thing about the 1% is that</p>
<p t="628560" d="2620">it has happened in every society that has ever been studied,</p>
<p t="631180" d="3440">it doesn't really matter what the governmental system is, it certainly</p>
<p t="634620" d="3200">happened under the Soviets, that's for sure</p>
<p t="637820" d="4300">and there was enough people that had enough zero that they just died,</p>
<p t="642460" d="500">so,</p>
<p t="643940" d="960">you know, the,</p>
<p t="645720" d="2960">the Utopian dream</p>
<p t="649180" d="2440">was completely un-implementable</p>
<p t="651720" d="2800">for a variety of very complex reasons, one</p>
<p t="654520" d="3980">is that it is very hard to fight against that distribution pattern</p>
<p t="658500" d="1780">when people are trading because</p>
<p t="660280" d="4000">mere statistics will do that, and then there are other things, and</p>
<p t="664280" d="5200">I should tell you as well that the Pareto distribution governs a lot of things, so,</p>
<p t="669980" d="3120">if you look at books, if I remember properly</p>
<p t="673100" d="5540">last year there was something like a million English language books published</p>
<p t="678980" d="3760">and I think that 500 of them sold more than 100,000 copies</p>
<p t="682740" d="3900">which is none, right, that is none, and of that 500 you can be sure</p>
<p t="686640" d="2160">that one of them was by Stephen King</p>
<p t="689080" d="1680">and he took half the money</p>
<p t="691020" d="4160">because like there is 5 authors in the English language who are</p>
<p t="695460" d="2280">on every airport</p>
<p t="698000" d="2920">paperback stand occupying the top</p>
<p t="700920" d="4460">rung and that's massive real estate, right, because it is replicated everywhere,</p>
<p t="705580" d="1960">and because they are so</p>
<p t="707820" d="2720">prominent and because they are no names</p>
<p t="710540" d="2920">when people are in a hurry and want something to read,</p>
<p t="713460" d="3460">they just grab that, and more money goes to those people, so you know,</p>
<p t="717240" d="2000">success breeds success</p>
<p t="719240" d="3460">and failure breeds failure, and it not necessarily linear</p>
<p t="722700" d="3080">and that is a really difficult thing to deal with,</p>
<p t="725860" d="2480">and it is hard on societies, because,</p>
<p t="728600" d="2400">one of the things we do know is that,</p>
<p t="731880" d="3520">you know, as you stretch out the inequality,</p>
<p t="736060" d="4440">you make men, particularly, on the lower end of the distribution,</p>
<p t="740500" d="2160">more and more likely to be aggressive,</p>
<p t="742660" d="3780">it's sort of like, you imagine every man has a threshold for violence,</p>
<p t="747000" d="2320">um, and status is important to men,</p>
<p t="749320" d="2240">not that it isn't important to women but,</p>
<p t="752000" d="1120">it's different,</p>
<p t="753120" d="2820">it's a different kind of status, it's status that is important to</p>
<p t="755940" d="2400">men because  it's one of the things that makes them</p>
<p t="758340" d="4360">marketable as partners to women so it actually turns out to be quite important to men</p>
<p t="762900" d="1280">men tend to compete</p>
<p t="765000" d="3600">with one another for status, hierarchy position, and</p>
<p t="769020" d="1920">in a really unequal society,</p>
<p t="771300" d="1520">if you are like a low</p>
<p t="773020" d="1120">rung guy,</p>
<p t="774140" d="3620">then, and you don't have any opportunity to rise because</p>
<p t="778060" d="2080">the society isn't structured</p>
<p t="780640" d="2080">so that there's mobility, then</p>
<p t="783260" d="1760">the more aggressive guys,</p>
<p t="785260" d="4000">tend to turn to criminality, and you know and so you could say</p>
<p t="789380" d="1600">there is a threshold for</p>
<p t="791320" d="960">criminality,</p>
<p t="792400" d="2880">and the more inequality pressure you put on</p>
<p t="795940" d="3360">a particular area, geographic or political area,</p>
<p t="799300" d="2420">the more inequality pressure you put on it,</p>
<p t="802860" d="2720">the more men slip past that threshold and</p>
<p t="805580" d="3960">into criminality, and you know there have been some pretty good studies done of</p>
<p t="810140" d="1120">drug gangs</p>
<p t="811260" d="5260">in Chicago, that was the best one, a sociologist actually went out and hung out with a drug gang</p>
<p t="816740" d="3040">he got into it, I guess the drug gang leader was,</p>
<p t="820560" d="740">you know,</p>
<p t="822020" d="4640">I wouldn't say necessarily narcissistic, that might be a reasonable</p>
<p t="826660" d="1360">way of thinking about it,</p>
<p t="828180" d="1120">and he was kind of</p>
<p t="829660" d="3600">happy with the idea of maybe being the subject of a book</p>
<p t="833900" d="3920">and, so this guy was able</p>
<p t="837820" d="3260">to associate with them, got to know them quite well,</p>
<p t="841260" d="2720">and then the housing project in which the</p>
<p t="844160" d="1240">gang was housed</p>
<p t="845400" d="2680">was slated for demolition and the gang broke up</p>
<p t="848580" d="1640">and he got the books</p>
<p t="850500" d="1600">because they kept books</p>
<p t="852100" d="4480">and what he found was the average street drug dealer, first of all was employed</p>
<p t="856660" d="1880">in another job, as well,</p>
<p t="859400" d="2920">and was making far less than minimum wage</p>
<p t="863000" d="3340">now, but guys further up the chain of course</p>
<p t="867400" d="5020">followed the Pareto distribution so there was a tiny minority of them that were raking in a tremendous amount of loot,</p>
<p t="872820" d="2540">and the guys at the bottom</p>
<p t="875360" d="3640">were just waiting around for the possibility that they could rise</p>
<p t="879000" d="3180">up the hierarchy and you know it's a pretty violent game, so,</p>
<p t="882220" d="2640">the chances that someone's going to be,</p>
<p t="886400" d="840">taken out</p>
<p t="887740" d="4240">it pretty high and so then a slot opens up for some opportunistic</p>
<p t="892980" d="3600">second rater and perhaps he can move up the hierarchy.</p>
<p t="900880" d="5200">So the Pareto distribution governs all sorts of other things too, I mentioned</p>
<p t="907540" d="2320">it governs the popularity of books</p>
<p t="909880" d="1200">the sales of books</p>
<p t="911100" d="2480">but it also, it also</p>
<p t="914600" d="5160">characterizes the distribution of everything that people produce,</p>
<p t="919760" d="5280">so if you think of creative production of any sort, artistic production, industrial production</p>
<p t="925040" d="1140">it doesn't matter,</p>
<p t="928580" d="1840">almost everything fails</p>
<p t="931820" d="2000">and a few things succeed</p>
<p t="933820" d="2440">beyond anyone's wildest imagination</p>
<p t="936260" d="3880">Apples' a good example of that, you know I mean, the iPhone,</p>
<p t="940400" d="2160">they have their competitors but</p>
<p t="942560" d="4400">it is an extraordinarily dominant product, and they rake in billions of dollars</p>
<p t="947020" d="3600">don't know if Apple is valued at a trillion dollars but</p>
<p t="951320" d="1280">it's close to that,</p>
<p t="952600" d="3720">and that is a lot of money, and I think if I remember correctly,</p>
<p t="956320" d="4580">it something like this, I probably have the figures wrong but the top 40 people,</p>
<p t="960900" d="3700">the richest 40 people in the world have as much money as the bottom 2 billion</p>
<p t="965440" d="3860">right, now, you know it not like they are stuffing their mattresses with that money</p>
<p t="969740" d="3720">or they have a skyscraper full of cash, that money  is out in the</p>
<p t="973940" d="3440">economy doing whatever money does, so</p>
<p t="978500" d="3200">you can't spend 28 billion dollars</p>
<p t="981700" d="4480">so, and sometimes you can even do some good with it, you know, Bill Gates seems to be</p>
<p t="986500" d="2700">doing something reasonable with his money,</p>
<p t="989200" d="4020">but the reason I am telling you this is because one of the things you should know</p>
<p t="993920" d="660">is that</p>
<p t="995460" d="2240">this proclivity for inequality</p>
<p t="998600" d="3520">is pervasive among the products of human beings</p>
<p t="1002140" d="1200">it is the case with</p>
<p t="1003660" d="3240">the goals scored in hockey, my son told me</p>
<p t="1006900" d="3280">and he is a reliable source on hockey statistics, that</p>
<p t="1010700" d="6320">if Wayne Gretzky, if you don't count any of the points that Wayne Gretzky managed with scoring,</p>
<p t="1017020" d="5440">he still had enough points just with assists to have more points than any hockey player that ever played,</p>
<p t="1022920" d="500">so,</p>
<p t="1024160" d="2520">you know, even at the upper end</p>
<p t="1026820" d="1520">of the distribution</p>
<p t="1028340" d="4040">there is some person whose, aahh, that is so good at what they do,</p>
<p t="1032380" d="4680">and then there is another person that is so much better than them that it is not even comparable</p>
<p t="1037420" d="500">and so,</p>
<p t="1038840" d="6000">and the benefits flow to people who are in that position, and you can understand why ,I would say because</p>
<p t="1045000" d="3280">you know, say you start writing, and you get a book</p>
<p t="1049000" d="740">and</p>
<p t="1049740" d="5440">rare things, very rare things to have happen, and some people read it and they like it and then of course</p>
<p t="1055180" d="2360">it is much more likely that you'll get a next book</p>
<p t="1057540" d="5820">and if people like that then it is even more likely that you will get a third book and then people start to know who you are</p>
<p t="1063360" d="4540">and then because they know who you are, they phone you up and offer you opportunities and your network grows,</p>
<p t="1068100" d="2160">it's like this exponential</p>
<p t="1070680" d="4080">increase in your reach and your capacity for production, and</p>
<p t="1075580" d="2640">more and more flows to you, and</p>
<p t="1079200" d="1920">then on the other hand</p>
<p t="1081660" d="4480">if you start to fail, and you know, why would someone fail, well God,</p>
<p t="1087940" d="7000">one idea that is very common in our culture is that poverty is caused by lack of money and that's a very stupid idea,</p>
<p t="1095580" d="4640">because money is very difficult to handle, I had clients who were drug addicts,</p>
<p t="1100220" d="5040">and the worst possible thing that could happen to them is that they got some money</p>
<p t="1105720" d="4320">they're just done, first of all, they were hanging around with people who were</p>
<p t="1110720" d="2480">a little on the sociopathic side and so,</p>
<p t="1113400" d="4500">especially if they weren't that bright and couldn't defend themselves very well</p>
<p t="1117900" d="4960">as soon as they got money, well it was off to the bar with all the friends, and, you know,</p>
<p t="1122860" d="4120">one guy I remember in particular, you know every time he got his,</p>
<p t="1128140" d="1680">his disability cheque,</p>
<p t="1129860" d="6000">he was gone for 5 days, you would find him in a ditch, you know, because he would go to the bar,</p>
<p t="1136620" d="4080">spend every cent he had on alcohol and cocaine, and,</p>
<p t="1142140" d="2240">wake up in a ditch ¾'s dead,</p>
<p t="1144780" d="3240">well, eventually completely dead, and,</p>
<p t="1148620" d="4880">you know then he was ashamed and horrified and repentant and</p>
<p t="1153500" d="5960">he would straighten himself out again and then that was all well and good, until, as long he was broke</p>
<p t="1159460" d="4320">until the next cheque showed up, and then, bang the same thing, so, you know,</p>
<p t="1163880" d="4320">it's not like money is necessarily a good for everyone</p>
<p t="1168200" d="5860">it's hard to manage money, it's really easy for it to disappear, I mean elderly people have a hell of a time now because</p>
<p t="1174240" d="4400">you know, crooks are contacting them on the Internet non-stop, and so</p>
<p t="1179240" d="1840">just giving people money</p>
<p t="1181080" d="3460">money it's like, it's like pouring water in their hands</p>
<p t="1184540" d="3920">it's not that helpful, not necessarily that helpful, and then of course,</p>
<p t="1188460" d="4240">contributors to poverty are , well, it's not that helpful to have a low IQ</p>
<p t="1192720" d="2920">you know, people don't like the idea of IQ</p>
<p t="1196460" d="4760">because it seems so arbitrary, you know, have a high IQ</p>
<p t="1201220" d="2480">well it's not like you deserve it exactly,</p>
<p t="1203700" d="6300">you are set up that way pretty much right from the beginning, it's a very, very, very, very stable.</p>
<p t="1210160" d="2560">You can make a high IQ person stupider</p>
<p t="1212720" d="3760">by not educating them up to the level of their possibility, but</p>
<p t="1216480" d="5040">taking someone who has a low IQ trying to raise that, it's like if you can figure out how to do that</p>
<p t="1221620" d="5440">well, you know, it's Nobel Prize time for you because people have tried that a lot,</p>
<p t="1227060" d="6320">and most recently with those you know Luminosity, Lumosity games and that sort of thing, the evidence that those produce</p>
<p t="1234120" d="5920">anything other than brilliant performances on the Lumosity game itself</p>
<p t="1240040" d="3500">is basically zero.  We haven't been able to figure out how to,</p>
<p t="1244120" d="3680">see, ‘cause, intelligence is a cross domain phenomena</p>
<p t="1247800" d="4120">and you can get really good in a single domain by practising like mad</p>
<p t="1251920" d="6080">and what you want is to practise like mad in a single domain and hope that it generalizes to other domains</p>
<p t="1258580" d="3520">that's the holy grail of intelligence increase, no,</p>
<p t="1262100" d="6740">no one has done it, people claim it, but the claims never hold up, and people have been trying for a long time</p>
<p t="1268840" d="3200">to do it, and then haven't been able to do it, and,</p>
<p t="1276040" d="4000">difference in IQ really make a difference, you know, I mean,</p>
<p t="1282120" d="2880">you guys average IQ's is probably 125, 130,</p>
<p t="1286120" d="4240">at 115 you are at the 85th percentile</p>
<p t="1292040" d="3760">and 115 would barely get you going for a hard university,</p>
<p t="1296120" d="5640">130, you are probably graduate school material, you know, 145</p>
<p t="1302540" d="1040">you are up there</p>
<p t="1303760" d="4400">at the range probably where you can pretty much do whatever you want</p>
<p t="1308160" d="4040">but as you get smarter, the scatter between your abilities increases</p>
<p t="1312200" d="4340">so you might have a very high verbal IQ, but not be so good at mathematics, or the other way around,</p>
<p t="1316540" d="3440">but it's a massive contributor to lifetime success,</p>
<p t="1320600" d="3840">and, I don't know what to do about that.</p>
<p t="1325020" d="2400">Why do smart people make more money?</p>
<p t="1329040" d="4280">Well, they get to where the edge of production is faster</p>
<p t="1333320" d="6320">so if you have a 1000 people and you rank order them by IQ the smart people are going to come up with the new ideas first</p>
<p t="1339640" d="4620">and they are going to have more ideas, and they are going to strategize better, and,</p>
<p t="1345380" d="3320">you know, with an IQ of 90, which is,</p>
<p t="1351580" d="4760">15% of the population, think about that, 15% of the population</p>
<p t="1357300" d="4480">that is pretty much the threshold for reading instructions and being able to follow them</p>
<p t="1363720" d="4000">so you know, and our society is increasing sophisticated  so</p>
<p t="1368840" d="1680">it is by no means obvious</p>
<p t="1371160" d="2240">you know the liberals think, well</p>
<p t="1373400" d="5240">that society is unfair because there is unemployment and conservatives think</p>
<p t="1378640" d="2120">that, well there is a job for everyone</p>
<p t="1380760" d="5620">but none of them think well there are massive, massive, massive differences in people's ability</p>
<p t="1386620" d="2320">far greater than anyone realizes,</p>
<p t="1389060" d="2800">and that poses a structural problem.</p>
<p t="1392060" d="1200">I had a client</p>
<p t="1394140" d="4080">and I got him a volunteer job which is way harder than you think</p>
<p t="1398220" d="1880">you need a police check, for example</p>
<p t="1400100" d="2640">Like it&#39;s harder to get a volunteer job than a real job</p>
<p t="1403060" d="2400">But I, We got him in a volunteer job and</p>
<p t="1405720" d="1480">he had to fold</p>
<p t="1407200" d="2660">pieces of paper, letters, it was, he worked at a charity</p>
<p t="1409880" d="4440">he had to fold pieces of paper, in three so that he could put them inside envelopes</p>
<p t="1414840" d="500">and</p>
<p t="1416480" d="5360">and the the letters, which were in a pile had to matched with the proper envelopes</p>
<p t="1421840" d="3560">which were also in a pile, some of them were French and some of them were English</p>
<p t="1425400" d="2560">so the French ones had to be carefully matched to the French</p>
<p t="1428580" d="4880">envelopes and, and then if, you know, if there was one envelope out of</p>
<p t="1433840" d="3680">order, well then he had to figure out whether it was the papers</p>
<p t="1437520" d="3000">that were out of order or the letters that were out of order</p>
<p t="1441000" d="1480">and then,</p>
<p t="1442480" d="3280">Some of the letters had photographs attached to them</p>
<p t="1445760" d="2260">and you weren&#39;t supposed to bend the photographs, but</p>
<p t="1448020" d="4240">they weren&#39;t all in the same place, so that meant you had to figure out how to fold</p>
<p t="1452260" d="5200">the paper in three, a bunch of different ways without creasing the photograph</p>
<p t="1457780" d="1920">and then, the other thing is,</p>
<p t="1460500" d="5040">and I never realized how difficult it is to put a piece of paper in an envelope</p>
<p t="1465540" d="2440">until I watched someone that couldn&#39;t do it</p>
<p t="1468460" d="2320">and he probably had an IQ of about 80</p>
<p t="1470780" d="4420">you know if you met him on the street you wouldn&#39;t think anything different of him,</p>
<p t="1475420" d="1480">he was a normal looking guy</p>
<p t="1476900" d="1600">had some other problems</p>
<p t="1480220" d="3800">I trained to fold those damn papers for like 30 hours</p>
<p t="1484680" d="2400">and he got reasonably good at it, but</p>
<p t="1487340" d="2280">you know, if you are good at it</p>
<p t="1489960" d="1600">and you probably all are</p>
<p t="1492360" d="3160">you fold it, and the edges line up exactly</p>
<p t="1495520" d="4080">like really exactly, the tolerance is probably  1/2 a millimeter or something like that</p>
<p t="1499600" d="1540">and then you do the second fold</p>
<p t="1501480" d="2360">and, the tolerance is the same</p>
<p t="1504020" d="2720">but let&#39;s imagine the first fold that you</p>
<p t="1506740" d="3320">you are out by an 1/8th of an inch and the second fold you are out by an 1/8th of an inch</p>
<p t="1510060" d="4280">so it&#39;s a little crooked, and that means in total you are out by a 1/4 of an inch</p>
<p t="1514400" d="2480">then it won&#39;t fit in the damn envelope</p>
<p t="1516880" d="4680">so then you kind of crumple the envelope when you put it there and then it gets stuck in the sorting machine</p>
<p t="1522380" d="500">and so</p>
<p t="1524440" d="4440">he sweated blood trying to do that job and eventually they</p>
<p t="1529000" d="2080">eventually planned to fire him</p>
<p t="1531220" d="3280">so imagine what that&#39;s  like, eh, you know</p>
<p t="1535540" d="1200">you can&#39;t get a job</p>
<p t="1537080" d="3280">and then so you get a job at a charity as a volunteer</p>
<p t="1541020" d="2560">and a charity decides to fire you</p>
<p t="1544120" d="1360">you know I mean, really</p>
<p t="1545780" d="4400">that&#39;s just, so I talked to the women who was running it and</p>
<p t="1551140" d="1040">suggested that</p>
<p t="1555340" d="4000">that might be a little on the devastating side, I mean she had her reasaons</p>
<p t="1559780" d="640">you know,</p>
<p t="1561180" d="4560">he, he,. he was always asking people questions about how to do his job</p>
<p t="1566380" d="3280">and you know so that meant he was interfering with the productivity of other people</p>
<p t="1569660" d="3100">and it was genuine interference, I mean, she wasn&#39;t being mean</p>
<p t="1573120" d="4880">and it was her job to make sure that the place did what it was supposed to, so</p>
<p t="1579060" d="2880">and, you know, she was between a rock and a hard place</p>
<p t="1584180" d="3280">he eventually decided that the job wasn&#39;t for him</p>
<p t="1587460" d="3340">relatively soon after that, I think it was too stressful</p>
<p t="1591060" d="500">and uh,</p>
<p t="1591560" d="4220">he quit, so that solved that problem, except then,  he didn&#39;t have a job</p>
<p t="1596140" d="2160">which of course is a problem</p>
<p t="1600160" d="3120">it has a happy ending this story, as  far as I know</p>
<p t="1603520" d="500">um, he</p>
<p t="1605440" d="3520">he got a dog because he was very lonesome, and that dog, man,</p>
<p t="1608960" d="3480">having that guy train that dog, that was something else, that dog just</p>
<p t="1612440" d="2420">I think he lost thirty pounds while he was training that dog</p>
<p t="1614860" d="2160">because dogs, you know, they are dominant</p>
<p t="1617020" d="6160">he had to have a tussle with the dog to figure out who was in charge, and it&#39;s a lot of responsibility to have a dog</p>
<p t="1623180" d="2360">but he was pretty damn committed to that dog</p>
<p t="1626260" d="2960">and he managed it, the things he went through</p>
<p t="1629220" d="3820">to keep that dog you cannot possibly imagine, it&#39;s like a, like a</p>
<p t="1635520" d="6960">it was surreal, just like the nuclear missile silo, I mean, he had people following him around informing</p>
<p t="1642480" d="1800">on him because they thought he was abusing the dog</p>
<p t="1644280" d="3380">when in fact, because I watched the dog was clearly abusing him</p>
<p t="1650360" d="500">so,</p>
<p t="1652100" d="2880">he got a job helping a women who trained dogs</p>
<p t="1655700" d="1280">and then he had a job</p>
<p t="1657580" d="1600">so hurray, you know, but</p>
<p t="1660380" d="2640">it was like a miracle fundamentally, so</p>
<p t="1663020" d="3480">Anyways, the reason I am telling you all this is because</p>
<p t="1666500" d="1920">there was a reason for the Cold War</p>
<p t="1669720" d="1520">and the reason was that</p>
<p t="1671480" d="1360">there is inequality</p>
<p t="1673480" d="2640">and there are different theories how to address that</p>
<p t="1676120" d="2420">inequality and different theories as to why it exists</p>
<p t="1679280" d="2000">and there was a Marxist theory</p>
<p t="1681280" d="4460">about why it exists which was roughly something  like property equal theft</p>
<p t="1685740" d="3660">and those who have more have taken it from those who have less</p>
<p t="1689640" d="500">which</p>
<p t="1692020" d="5600">seems to me to eliminate any conceptualization that there isn&#39;t a fixed pot of money</p>
<p t="1697620" d="4920">you know money expands actually,  as we become more technologically proficient</p>
<p t="1703220" d="500">and,</p>
<p t="1704140" d="4400">lots of people who have money have it because generated a lot of wealth</p>
<p t="1708560" d="6160">Bill Gates is a great example of that right he popularized computing he made it possible for everybody to</p>
<p t="1715160" d="4880">to have access to computing, it&#39;s like, it seems like a good, good for him you know</p>
<p t="1720040" d="3080">and you could say the same thing about Steve Jobs</p>
<p t="1723120" d="2480">and maybe you will be able to say the same thing about Elon Musk, and</p>
<p t="1725600" d="3180">you know, these guys have tremendous resources at their diposal</p>
<p t="1729180" d="500">but</p>
<p t="1730820" d="1760">you know, they&#39;re not like</p>
<p t="1733540" d="3120">bathing in bank notes, you know, they&#39;re</p>
<p t="1737180" d="4320">trying to continue to do things, they use their money to do things</p>
<p t="1744920" d="560">anyways</p>
<p t="1746500" d="4240">The Russians set themselves up under Marxist presuppositions</p>
<p t="1751520" d="1480">and tried to</p>
<p t="1753440" d="2640">equalize the distribution of property</p>
<p t="1756200" d="540">and</p>
<p t="1757100" d="5360">to call that catastrophic barely scratches the surface, I know that</p>
<p t="1762460" d="4100">you guys probably don&#39;t learn much about this because for some reason</p>
<p t="1766560" d="2320">people aren&#39;t taught about it, but</p>
<p t="1771880" d="6800">good estimates are that the Russians killed about 30 million of their own people between 1919 and 1959</p>
<p t="1778700" d="1120">you know and it&#39;s</p>
<p t="1780540" d="820">brutal</p>
<p t="1782080" d="2960">brutal, a lot of that was through starvation</p>
<p t="1785040" d="3500">you know I saw a photograph the other day, which I tweeted</p>
<p t="1788540" d="4120">which is the worst photograph I have ever seen in my life and that is actually saying a lot because,</p>
<p t="1792660" d="3160">I have seen a lot of really terrible photographs because I&#39;ve</p>
<p t="1795820" d="3060">done so much investigation into totalitarianism</p>
<p t="1799180" d="3360">this was a photograph taken during one of the early</p>
<p t="1802820" d="5640">starvation...  periods in the Soviet Union where about three million peasants died</p>
<p t="1808460" d="1660">was a picture of a peasant couple</p>
<p t="1810120" d="4560">standing behind a table at a market selling human body parts for food</p>
<p t="1815780" d="2400">and you know, I have this weird quirk</p>
<p t="1819000" d="2720">which I don&#39;t think does me much good, but</p>
<p t="1821880" d="500">maybe</p>
<p t="1822460" d="2320">helps me understand things better</p>
<p t="1824780" d="2580">when I see that someone has dome something</p>
<p t="1827920" d="840">extreme,</p>
<p t="1828860" d="5440">I learned to this a long time ago when I worked briefly in a maximum security prison</p>
<p t="1835500" d="2400">I try to imagine, what I would have to like</p>
<p t="1837900" d="4000">what kind of situation  what sort of situation would I have to find myself in</p>
<p t="1841980" d="720">to do that</p>
<p t="1842980" d="960">and believe me, man,</p>
<p t="1845160" d="2160">that&#39;s a horrifying enterprise because</p>
<p t="1847880" d="1720">it is actually possible</p>
<p t="1849760" d="2880">no matter what you read about someone doing</p>
<p t="1852860" d="3840">and no matter how unlikely you think that you would do that</p>
<p t="1857140" d="1440">It&#39;s possible,</p>
<p t="1859300" d="4080">to imagine yourself in that situation, and that</p>
<p t="1865960" d="2740">well that&#39;s enlightening, that&#39;s what I would say, that&#39;s enlightening</p>
<p t="1869180" d="2180">you know because one of the things about enlightenment</p>
<p t="1872700" d="500">is that</p>
<p t="1874580" d="1880">you get enlightened by doing</p>
<p t="1877120" d="4320">things that necessary that you really, really, really do not want to know</p>
<p t="1881800" d="1080">don&#39;t want to do</p>
<p t="1883480" d="4160">and imagine, imagining yourself as a perpetrator of that sort</p>
<p t="1888140" d="500">is</p>
<p t="1889360" d="3600">that tells you something about the world, and it tells you something about human beings, but</p>
<p t="1895020" d="3280">it&#39;s a hell of thing to swallow, you know, in a very</p>
<p t="1898300" d="2160">well structured society such as ours</p>
<p t="1902200" d="1440">where we are so peaceful</p>
<p t="1903880" d="2200">well because we have the heat</p>
<p t="1906080" d="3740">and it always works, and we have electricity, and it always works</p>
<p t="1910380" d="4320">and we have plumbing, which a  bloody miracle, and it always works</p>
<p t="1914700" d="1080">you know, it&#39;s just</p>
<p t="1916340" d="5200">One of the things that this imagination process has done for me is keep me alert</p>
<p t="1923460" d="4800">to the absolute miracle that my life is everyday</p>
<p t="1928900" d="1840">It&#39;s horrbly cold out there</p>
<p t="1930900" d="1520">You can&#39;t grow any food</p>
<p t="1932940" d="2800">You&#39;d die if you were out there for 24 hours</p>
<p t="1936460" d="5580">If any of the infrastructure was unreliable for any length of time we would be in serious trouble</p>
<p t="1942300" d="2160">and it&#39;s never unreliable</p>
<p t="1945060" d="1120">It&#39;s so unlikely</p>
<p t="1947000" d="2920">and so we are, with all this reliable</p>
<p t="1950040" d="1120">infrastructure</p>
<p t="1951160" d="4000">and because of that we don;t have to compete with each other much</p>
<p t="1955160" d="800">I mean, some</p>
<p t="1956460" d="1760">You don&#39;t compete for food</p>
<p t="1958220" d="3480">You don&#39;t compete for shelter, or some people do but not many</p>
<p t="1961860" d="3840">So, it really easy to think of yourself as good, because</p>
<p t="1967040" d="720">You&#39;re not</p>
<p t="1968320" d="2080">doing anything nasty to anyone</p>
<p t="1970400" d="4720">but, you know,  a cynic might say well that, that&#39;s just because you don&#39;t have any reason to</p>
<p t="1976000" d="1520">but, those reasons</p>
<p t="1977740" d="2560">have arisen many times in the past, and</p>
<p t="1981580" d="4560">in fact they&#39;re the norm, not the exception,  we&#39;re the exception,  this</p>
<p t="1986660" d="1000">insanely</p>
<p t="1988060" d="2160">functional society that</p>
<p t="1990400" d="2560">we have somehow managed to generate is</p>
<p t="1994060" d="3200">it is incomprehensible to me that it exists</p>
<p t="1998040" d="500">so,</p>
<p t="2003940" d="560">Anyways</p>
<p t="2005660" d="4080">back in the industrial, the end of the industrial revolution</p>
<p t="2009800" d="2880">The conditions of the worker were pretty brutal</p>
<p t="2012680" d="6320">I mean George Orwell wrote a book called &quot;Road to Wigan Pier&quot; which I highly recommend, it&#39;s a great book</p>
<p t="2019440" d="2240">and he went up in the 30&#39;s</p>
<p t="2022300" d="1560">I think it was the 30&#39;s</p>
<p t="2024220" d="4160">To work, to live with the coal miners up in Northern U.K.</p>
<p t="2028640" d="1920">and, those poor guys</p>
<p t="2030560" d="5680">your know they had to crawl to work for two miles down a tunnel that they couldn&#39;t stand up in</p>
<p t="2036440" d="1720">just to start their shift</p>
<p t="2038840" d="4640">and after their 8 hours of hacking away at the coal walls</p>
<p t="2043480" d="3200">which is rather difficult, dirty and dangerous</p>
<p t="2046680" d="5060">and of course you get black lung from it fatal and of course they didn&#39;t get paid very much</p>
<p t="2051740" d="1700">so after doing that for 8 hours</p>
<p t="2054540" d="2400">then you , crawled back, your 2 miles</p>
<p t="2057080" d="3840">and you didn&#39;t get paid for that, that was just the commute</p>
<p t="2061360" d="2160">and the housing for those people</p>
<p t="2063520" d="4040">was not good, the food wasn&#39;&#39;t good, most of them had not teeth by the time they were 30</p>
<p t="2067560" d="840">you know, I mean</p>
<p t="2068400" d="4820">being poor was no joke even in a place like the U.K. which was relatively well off</p>
<p t="2073260" d="2100">and so there was every reason to be</p>
<p t="2075360" d="2980">concerned between the disparity between rich andpoor</p>
<p t="2079040" d="2560">and poor is the natural state, you know</p>
<p t="2081860" d="6320">In the Western world, in 1895 the typical person lived on a dollar a day in today&#39;s dollars</p>
<p t="2088780" d="1680">and, you know, that&#39;s not</p>
<p t="2091040" d="2640">uncommon in many places in the world now</p>
<p t="2094800" d="500">so</p>
<p t="2096260" d="2520">there are reasons to be concerned with inequality</p>
<p t="2098780" d="5160">and, you know,  the Russians took one pathway inspired by Marx and we took another pathway</p>
<p t="2105140" d="1240">inspired by</p>
<p t="2107020" d="2120">John Stuart Mill and John Locke</p>
<p t="2110100" d="2240">the English tradition I would so, democracy</p>
<p t="2112640" d="1800">and, competed for</p>
<p t="2116820" d="840">70 years</p>
<p t="2118800" d="3400">and, things seem to have worked out better here</p>
<p t="2122880" d="2880">but, with a hell of a competition</p>
<p t="2125760" d="3220">and there were real differences of opinion at the bottom of it</p>
<p t="2129260" d="5840">and those two systems turned into armed camps, and that&#39;s not over exactly, you know, I mean</p>
<p t="2136120" d="5920">there are Chinese, although  they&#39;re a hybrid now between Communism and capitalism</p>
<p t="2142040" d="4160">and hopefully they are more interested in getting rich  than they are, in, you know</p>
<p t="2146700" d="1480">having a war</p>
<p t="2148520" d="2560">greed is a good motivator</p>
<p t="2151600" d="2300">surprisingly enough it is kind of reliable</p>
<p t="2155340" d="4320">but, anyways, by 1989, the jig was up</p>
<p t="2160420" d="3440">it was obvious that the Soviet system, could not</p>
<p t="2164880" d="2360">was not functional, there, was no</p>
<p t="2168080" d="6000">consumer goods, that&#39;s for sure, even in the main department stores in Moscow</p>
<p t="2174640" d="3360">people just kind of lost faith in the whole project</p>
<p t="2178320" d="1280">you know, it became</p>
<p t="2179720" d="500">huh!</p>
<p t="2180220" d="3220">for a while, I don&#39;t know if you know about the show Dallas</p>
<p t="2184360" d="2640">Dallas was a soap opera that ran at night</p>
<p t="2187360" d="3140">a serial, and uh, it was about these rich</p>
<p t="2191400" d="4400">Texans, who lived, you know, a 1% lifestyle</p>
<p t="2196140" d="3120">and it was the most popular show in East Germany</p>
<p t="2199260" d="2860">the streets would empty so people could watch Dallas</p>
<p t="2202300" d="500">well,</p>
<p t="2203960" d="4620">when you are sitting in you horrible Soviet architecture flat</p>
<p t="2208640" d="3960">that, you know you had to struggle to get with your  informing</p>
<p t="2212600" d="5220">relatives, because 1 out of 3 people in East Germany was an informer, a government informer</p>
<p t="2218120" d="5440">and you watch Dallas, you know, there is a little cognitive dissonance occurring</p>
<p t="2224240" d="620">and so,</p>
<p t="2226720" d="880">it fell apart</p>
<p t="2228240" d="500">and</p>
<p t="2229480" d="2800">quite peacefully actually, you know, there was a war in</p>
<p t="2232280" d="2400">there was a bit of a war in Eastern Europe</p>
<p t="2236140" d="500">but</p>
<p t="2238360" d="2700">it fell apart remarkably peacefully, and so here we are</p>
<p t="2241060" d="3440">and we don&#39;t know what do with the pesky Russians, but</p>
<p t="2246360" d="560">at least</p>
<p t="2246920" d="5040">there is no evidence that they are our mortal enemies for fundamental reasons of</p>
<p t="2252240" d="2000">axiomatic presupposition</p>
<p t="2257340" d="1760">and things are a lot better</p>
<p t="2259700" d="800">in the world</p>
<p t="2260500" d="2160">despite what everyone tells you</p>
<p t="2262660" d="2780">than they were 40 years ago, and they are so much better than they</p>
<p t="2265600" d="3200">were 50 years ago that is absolutely staggering</p>
<p t="2268800" d="3080">We have lifted more people out of poverty in the last 15 years</p>
<p t="2271880" d="4400">that have been lifted out of poverty in the entire history of the world before then</p>
<p t="2276600" d="3380">people are, gathering economic resources</p>
<p t="2280160" d="5540">at a rate that even the wildest optimist really couldn&#39;t dream of speeding up</p>
<p t="2286920" d="500">so,</p>
<p t="2289900" d="2360">It&#39;s not like we are not without our problems, but,</p>
<p t="2293660" d="1920">So during that period of time</p>
<p t="2298260" d="2960">I was obsessed, would be a good word</p>
<p t="2302220" d="500">with</p>
<p t="2304380" d="2160">a question, and the question was</p>
<p t="2308700" d="620">Why,</p>
<p t="2310660" d="1440">would human beings</p>
<p t="2314360" d="1780">produce two camps</p>
<p t="2317760" d="680">and then</p>
<p t="2319300" d="2960">produce a massive arsenal of hydrogen bombs</p>
<p t="2322260" d="4100">and I don&#39;t know what you know about hydrogen bombs, but they have atom bombs for triggers</p>
<p t="2327320" d="3680">and, you know, that&#39;s worth thing because an atom bomb, you know, hey, that&#39;s</p>
<p t="2332000" d="2820">that&#39;s something, but a hydrogen bomb</p>
<p t="2334860" d="3140">that&#39;s the sun, that&#39;s really something</p>
<p t="2338140" d="5900">so, and you know, at the peak of the cold war, and this is still true to some degree</p>
<p t="2344040" d="3940">there were literally tens of thousands of these weapons aimed</p>
<p t="2348080" d="2680">at the Soviet Union and at the West, and</p>
<p t="2351320" d="1040">that was enough</p>
<p t="2352760" d="2480">pretty much put and end to everything</p>
<p t="2355840" d="3580">and, that&#39;s a dangerous game, man, you know and</p>
<p t="2359420" d="4920">not only because of intent, but also because of the possibility of accidental</p>
<p t="2364760" d="1760">just an accident, you know</p>
<p t="2366600" d="5520">just a mistake, or just someone whose a little crazier than you might want them to be</p>
<p t="2372460" d="4240">you know, and you might think, well no one would want to bring about the destruction of the world  but</p>
<p t="2376980" d="3080">that just means you don&#39;t know very much about Stalin</p>
<p t="2380880" d="660">because</p>
<p t="2381640" d="3920">of all the people who lived in the 20th century who had power</p>
<p t="2386080" d="1000">Stalin was</p>
<p t="2388320" d="3460">the most motivated to bring everything to an end</p>
<p t="2392760" d="3060">There is some evidence that he was murdered, by</p>
<p t="2396460" d="3600">Khrushchev, and his crew, and Khrushchev was the next leader</p>
<p t="2400420" d="500">and</p>
<p t="2401480" d="5220">if he was not murdered, he was at least not provided with medical attention when he was dying</p>
<p t="2408580" d="5480">and uh, there is reasonable evidence that he was gearing to invade Western Europe</p>
<p t="2414060" d="3160">and he really didn&#39;t care how much destruction would go along with that,</p>
<p t="2417300" d="3780">I mean, he had already killed tens of millions of people</p>
<p t="2421080" d="5560">he had a lot of practice, he was good at it, it didn&#39;t really bother him, maybe even enjoyed it</p>
<p t="2430580" d="500">so,</p>
<p t="2432540" d="4900">what the hell, that&#39;s what I thought, how can it be that you are doing this, it&#39;s so insane</p>
<p t="2438820" d="4080">so then I started to think about belief systems, you know</p>
<p t="2443480" d="4380">because you could say that each camp had it&#39;s own belief system, the one in the West was derived</p>
<p t="2448220" d="2120">and had a very lengthy history</p>
<p t="2450680" d="4860">derived from the Greeks and the Romans, and the Jews and the Christians</p>
<p t="2456620" d="4300">and from various schools of philosophy and from the Enlightenment and all that, and then</p>
<p t="2461200" d="4280">the Soviet Union was basically predicated on a rational philosophy</p>
<p t="2466060" d="4820">that, that opposed the axioms that the West had evolved</p>
<p t="2471820" d="4120">and each group organized their societies around that, and</p>
<p t="2477560" d="2680">Now I took political science for quite a long time</p>
<p t="2482260" d="3280">and the political scientists and the economists</p>
<p t="2486400" d="3160">they basically thought that people competed over resources</p>
<p t="2491220" d="6080">but that wasn&#39;t a very good answer as far as I was concerned, because it wasn&#39;t obvious to me why people valued the resources they valued</p>
<p t="2497980" d="4040">The economists just assumed that there are resources that you valued, but</p>
<p t="2502020" d="2920">but, you know, people can value a lot of different things, it&#39;s</p>
<p t="2504940" d="5240">it&#39;s not exactly fixed, I mean, you tend to value food very highly if you are hungry, obviously, but</p>
<p t="2510180" d="2860">but there are lots of thing that we value and that we want that</p>
<p t="2513360" d="4300">seem somewhat arbitrary, somewhat like a decision</p>
<p t="2518160" d="4840">so I got more interested in why people valued things, and, what it meant to value something</p>
<p t="2523000" d="2860">and then what it meant to believe something</p>
<p t="2527220" d="560">and then</p>
<p t="2528600" d="4000">how it could be that someone could believe something, so deeply</p>
<p t="2532980" d="2380">that they would risk their own death, to</p>
<p t="2535400" d="3520">protect it, or at least risk the death of other people</p>
<p t="2539380" d="5840">and maybe on a massive scale, like, man, people are committeda  to their system</p>
<p t="2545820" d="7000">now, you know, a system of belief is not just a system of belief, that&#39;s one of the things I came to understand is that it&#39;s not</p>
<p t="2552940" d="3120">appropriate, to make this too psychological</p>
<p t="2556480" d="3280">people defend their belief systems, but that&#39;s not exactly right, you know</p>
<p t="2559860" d="2000">we have a shared belief system</p>
<p t="2562520" d="3440">well it&#39;s sufficiently shared so, that, here we are</p>
<p t="2565960" d="3260">we don&#39;t know each other, we are a bunch of primates</p>
<p t="2570180" d="3760">we are in this room and it&#39;s peaceful, and no one&#39;s scared</p>
<p t="2573940" d="4420">and that&#39;s pretty amazing and that means we are all acting out our roles</p>
<p t="2578840" d="5280">so, we acting out our roles and we have an expectation with regard to those roles</p>
<p t="2584200" d="1920">and those two things match</p>
<p t="2586560" d="3160">and that&#39;s the important thing, and we will talk about that a lot</p>
<p t="2589720" d="4240">it isn&#39;t the belief system, or the integrity of the belief system even</p>
<p t="2593960" d="5800">it&#39;s the match between the belief system and the actions of the other people within the belief system</p>
<p t="2599760" d="2040">what you want to maintain is that match</p>
<p t="2601960" d="2080">you want to act out your beliefs</p>
<p t="2604640" d="3400">in the world, and you want what you want to happen</p>
<p t="2608040" d="4460">that&#39;s a good thing, you get what you want and you validate your belief system, great</p>
<p t="2613140" d="1280">perfect, security</p>
<p t="2614640" d="3600">but a lot of that is, we are interacting, even right now</p>
<p t="2618240" d="4800">there is a whole set of expectations that are governing what we are doing,  like you don&#39;t want me to take your</p>
<p t="2623040" d="3040">little tablet there and smash it, that would be</p>
<p t="2626080" d="2620">shocking, right, you wouldn&#39;t know what the hell to do</p>
<p t="2628700" d="3140">right, you would be somewhere different it I did that</p>
<p t="2632400" d="2540">and you wouldn&#39;t know where you were</p>
<p t="2635380" d="2180">and that is another thing to know, because</p>
<p t="2638440" d="3480">that is a fundamental difference, there is a fundamental difference</p>
<p t="2642260" d="2060">between knowing where you are</p>
<p t="2644820" d="1920">and not knowing where you are</p>
<p t="2646740" d="5420">I think that it&#39;s, in some sense, the fundamental difference, you can think about it as the distinction between</p>
<p t="2652160" d="3800">explored and unexplored territory, but you have to</p>
<p t="2661980" d="4160">I don&#39;t know if you have taken a cat to a new house, cats hate that</p>
<p t="2667040" d="6080">and, because in their old house, and maybe in their old neighborhood, they&#39;ve slunk around</p>
<p t="2673120" d="2700">you know, at the edges, checking everything out</p>
<p t="2676400" d="1780">they start out afraid</p>
<p t="2678640" d="4800">they check everything out, they know where to hide, they now what&#39;s safe</p>
<p t="2683440" d="1720">and they know that because they go somewehere</p>
<p t="2685160" d="2640">and nothing happens, so then they assume that it is safe</p>
<p t="2687800" d="4740">and they slowly, build up a neighborhood that they are comfortable with</p>
<p t="2692540" d="5200">My dad used to take the dog for a walk, and the cat got lonesome and it started to follow him, and</p>
<p t="2697740" d="3720">First of all, it would go along the buildings, the houses on their route</p>
<p t="2702480" d="2660">hiding, really from predators, and</p>
<p t="2705960" d="4100">after a while it got kind off comfortable with that then it follow right behind the dog</p>
<p t="2710280" d="2620">but, it had a border, and if</p>
<p t="2713980" d="4120">my dad took the dog over one street to many for the cat</p>
<p t="2718140" d="2460">the cat would just sit on the corner and</p>
<p t="2721260" d="2800">you know, cry, like a cat cries, it was like</p>
<p t="2724800" d="4400">that&#39;s it for me man, I am not going any further out into the unknown</p>
<p t="2729640" d="500">and so,</p>
<p t="2730140" d="1460">the distinction</p>
<p t="2731700" d="4400">between the territory that you have mastered</p>
<p t="2736100" d="4120">and the territory that you haven&#39;t mastered, is a fundamental distinction</p>
<p t="2740280" d="4700">it is the distinction between home and the strange land</p>
<p t="2744980" d="6340">and the thing about familiar territory for people, is that most of the familiar territory that we inhabit</p>
<p t="2751320" d="1280">is other people</p>
<p t="2752600" d="3160">because we are so social, you can&#39;t really think</p>
<p t="2755760" d="6040">it&#39;s a weird way of thinking about territory, it&#39;s not exactly geographical, objective territory, it&#39;s</p>
<p t="2762200" d="2880">territory with a dominance hierarchy in it</p>
<p t="2765080" d="2760">and the dominance hierarchy has a predictable structure</p>
<p t="2767840" d="2280">and you know where you fit in it most of the time</p>
<p t="2770120" d="3900">and so when you act out in that territory surrounded by your people</p>
<p t="2774020" d="1880">then often you get what you want</p>
<p t="2775900" d="2720">and, you are so thrilled about that, because</p>
<p t="2779160" d="3000">you just don&#39;t want someone acting erratically around you</p>
<p t="2782160" d="3020">like, and you know that, so you walk down Bloor</p>
<p t="2785180" d="4720">and there are people there that really should be institutionalized, but</p>
<p t="2789900" d="5460">we de-institutionalized them all so that they could be free, and free to be, you know</p>
<p t="2796520" d="4240">suffering and malfunctioning, and out on the street, that&#39;s what the freedom ended up being</p>
<p t="2800760" d="3180">but you know, you&#39;ll walk by someone like that whose</p>
<p t="2805120" d="4000">muttering away to the voices in his head and, you know, maybe</p>
<p t="2810860" d="3520">striking out against what ever it is that&#39;s plaguing him and</p>
<p t="2815320" d="1600">you&#39;ll make eye contact</p>
<p t="2818180" d="4340">you might even go across the street, you are certainly give him a wide berth, you are going to keep</p>
<p t="2822820" d="2820">a distance between him and you.</p>
<p t="2825640" d="3340">and you are going to hope that you don&#39;t attract his attention</p>
<p t="2828980" d="2480">because, he&#39;s not in the dominance hierarchy</p>
<p t="2831460" d="2660">and you don&#39;t know what the hell he might do</p>
<p t="2834540" d="2520">and that&#39;s unexplored territory too</p>
<p t="2837100" d="2880">and that&#39;s another way of thinking about it</p>
<p t="2840660" d="5680">We inhabit time and space, not just space, and not just time, we inhabit time and space</p>
<p t="2846860" d="3920">and out territories are spatio-temporal, we are here - now</p>
<p t="2851460" d="1740">and this is safe, now</p>
<p t="2853200" d="3940">and it&#39;s safe, partly because of the physical structure and it&#39;s working</p>
<p t="2857380" d="4640">but it&#39;s also because none of you are manifesting peculiar behaviour</p>
<p t="2862720" d="3360">but if you started to manifest peculiar behaviour</p>
<p t="2866480" d="3200">if you stood up and started muttering or yelling</p>
<p t="2869680" d="2460">or maybe attacking someone next to you</p>
<p t="2872600" d="2080">all the rest of you freeze first</p>
<p t="2874960" d="3260">because all of a sudden this would be unexplored territory</p>
<p t="2878900" d="5120">the match between what you want, which is a peaceful lecture that you hope has some content</p>
<p t="2886100" d="4480">the match between what you want and what is happening, has vanished</p>
<p t="2890580" d="3380">and so then, you&#39;re not, you don&#39;t know where you are</p>
<p t="2894680" d="2640">and so what do you do when you don&#39;t know where you are</p>
<p t="2898080" d="1980">what do you do when you don&#39;t know what to do</p>
<p t="2900420" d="2220">well, if you are a computer then you just crash</p>
<p t="2903100" d="500">but</p>
<p t="2904880" d="4340">you know, what good is that to you, you are just going to die, that isn&#39;t helpful</p>
<p t="2910900" d="1960">you freeze, first</p>
<p t="2913940" d="4920">and then you maybe cautiously attend, or maybe you don&#39;t, maybe you just keep you&#39;re damn eyes averted</p>
<p t="2918860" d="2340">and you sit there and you hope that no one notices you</p>
<p t="2921200" d="6000">that&#39;s a prey response, right that&#39;s like a rabbit frozen when it thinks a fox is looking at it</p>
<p t="2927200" d="2180">and we were prey animals for a long time</p>
<p t="2929760" d="1040">there was a cat</p>
<p t="2931280" d="5600">that they recently discovered, a prehistoric cat that had this bottom single tooth</p>
<p t="2936880" d="1460">and they found out that it</p>
<p t="2938340" d="6480">a human skull fit right inside it&#39;s mouth and so it could grab you here and pierce the back of your skull with it&#39;s</p>
<p t="2945960" d="4260">single tooth, and that is what it was evolved for, so, you know</p>
<p t="2952040" d="4620">It&#39;s under such conditions we evolved and we are predators obviously</p>
<p t="2956660" d="4640">but we are tasty predators, and so other things were perfectly happy to eat us</p>
<p t="2964060" d="3920">and so where you are don&#39;t know what to do you act like a prey animal</p>
<p t="2968300" d="4260">and that is probably what you should do because maybe if you keep your head down</p>
<p t="2972640" d="1280">and shut the hell up</p>
<p t="2973920" d="2760">there won&#39;t be any attention attracted to you</p>
<p t="2976680" d="1960">and maybe you will get through it</p>
<p t="2979880" d="4240">you might decide, unlikely, to intervene</p>
<p t="2984960" d="1480">and take the guy down</p>
<p t="2986840" d="500">but</p>
<p t="2989040" d="5160">but you would be the exception rather than the norm, and it&#39;s unsurprising</p>
<p t="2999020" d="680">OK, so</p>
<p t="3001680" d="4120">What is came to understand is that belief systems regulated emotions</p>
<p t="3006420" d="3840">but not exactly psychologically, like, it isn&#39;t exactly</p>
<p t="3010260" d="6140">it isn&#39;t exactly, and this is sort of like the terror management theories, it&#39;s not exactly like you have a theory</p>
<p t="3016400" d="3900">in your head, and because the theory explains the world, and because the theory explains the world</p>
<p t="3020300" d="2200">the theory is what is making you secure</p>
<p t="3022500" d="1420">it&#39;s kind of like that</p>
<p t="3023960" d="2480">it&#39;s like you have a theory in you head</p>
<p t="3026440" d="3140">and the theory makes you feel secure because it explains the world</p>
<p t="3029580" d="4180">but the reason it explains the world is because other people have the theory in their head</p>
<p t="3033800" d="2320">and when you both act out the theory</p>
<p t="3036300" d="5180">you both get what you want, and it&#39;s the coming together of the theory</p>
<p t="3041540" d="2500">and the outcome that makes you</p>
<p t="3045780" d="640">it&#39;s life</p>
<p t="3047360" d="1220">not only does it</p>
<p t="3049060" d="4780">stop you from being anxious and often make you happy because you get what you want, but</p>
<p t="3053840" d="4840">it&#39;s not just psychological you know the fact that we do this, that we cooperate</p>
<p t="3058680" d="3900">within our societies, we match our belief systems and then act them out</p>
<p t="3062600" d="3180">that&#39;s the predicate a productive society</p>
<p t="3065980" d="7020">so, it&#39;s actually, it isn&#39;t that just that it saves you from death anxiety like the terror management</p>
<p t="3073100" d="2800">theorists have it, it saves you from death</p>
<p t="3075920" d="5200">and, that&#39;s good, I mean, being protected from death anxiety, yay, well, good</p>
<p t="3081120" d="5380">that&#39;s great too man, but actually not dying, that sort of the fundamental thing that you are after</p>
<p t="3087140" d="3520">and so, people have reason to defend their territory</p>
<p t="3090660" d="6280">if you think of territory that way, if you think about it as a domain where the fundamental presuppositions</p>
<p t="3096940" d="4900">of each citizen are matched by the behavior of their co-citizens</p>
<p t="3102020" d="2080">They have every reason to defend that</p>
<p t="3104600" d="3280">and if it falls apart, it can have mortally</p>
<p t="3108680" d="7000">serious consequences, it&#39;s chaos, you know that chaos just doesn&#39;t destabilize everybody psychologically</p>
<p t="3115680" d="3440">it destabilizes everything, it can destabilize the currency</p>
<p t="3119120" d="4860">it can destabilize the industrial economy, the lights can go off it&#39;s like</p>
<p t="3124460" d="1140">it&#39;s not good,</p>
<p t="3126080" d="640">so</p>
<p t="3127720" d="2300">hey, no wonder people protect it</p>
<p t="3134420" d="3500">so then I started thinking about what a belief system was</p>
<p t="3139880" d="720">and</p>
<p t="3143480" d="4000">I realized that a belief system was actually a set of moral guidelines</p>
<p t="3148480" d="4400">and moral guidelines are guidelines about how you should, behave</p>
<p t="3153160" d="1980">also how you should perceive</p>
<p t="3155440" d="2480">and the reason that a moral guideline</p>
<p t="3158280" d="3020">is necessary for you to perceive is that</p>
<p t="3162180" d="3220">you can&#39;t look at anything without a hierarchy of value</p>
<p t="3165400" d="3840">right, think about it, how may things in this room could you look at</p>
<p t="3169580" d="3740">there is an innumerable in this room to look at</p>
<p t="3173320" d="3700">there are just all  the squares, the little tiny squares in this fabric</p>
<p t="3177020" d="4980">you could look at those things, for, until the end of time, one at a time, but you don&#39;t do that</p>
<p t="3182400" d="2800">in fact, if I took most of you out of this room</p>
<p t="3185200" d="5500">there is a very low probability that you would be able to tell me what color the walls were, or</p>
<p t="3190700" d="2120">even if those things were on the walls</p>
<p t="3193420" d="3700">and the reason for that,  is that, who cares</p>
<p t="3197880" d="2360">as long as the walls don&#39;t move</p>
<p t="3200240" d="3180">color is irrelavant, and there is no reason for you to remember it</p>
<p t="3203640" d="2240">it has no emotional significance</p>
<p t="3206060" d="1460">it has no value</p>
<p t="3207900" d="1840">and so what you do instead is</p>
<p t="3210220" d="3860">well, this is what you&#39;re doing, so, why are you here</p>
<p t="3214080" d="6040">I don&#39;t mean in, the broad metaphysical sense, I mean specifically why are you here right now</p>
<p t="3220700" d="2680">and I would say that you are students, obviously</p>
<p t="3223380" d="2380">and you are trying to get a degree, and</p>
<p t="3225760" d="3180">you know you believe that will have some functional utility</p>
<p t="3228940" d="3020">maybe you will be a little wiser, and a little more literate</p>
<p t="3231960" d="6020">and be able to think a little better, and be able to write a little better and so you will actually be more functional in the world</p>
<p t="3238000" d="1200">that would be good</p>
<p t="3239200" d="3660">you know, and, maybe you are interested, but anyways it&#39;s</p>
<p t="3243680" d="5320">You&#39;re in this particular lecture, so that you can take this particular class</p>
<p t="3249000" d="2740">so that you can get a particular kind of degree</p>
<p t="3251740" d="4760">so that you can launch your life, and then in your life you are probably going to meet someone that you</p>
<p t="3256500" d="5200">have a long term relationship with, and you are going to have children, and you are going to partake in the society, and</p>
<p t="3262120" d="5360">that&#39;s why you are here, all of those reasons, simultaneously is why you are here</p>
<p t="3267840" d="800">and so then</p>
<p t="3268640" d="2260">that helps you decide what to look at</p>
<p t="3271320" d="1820">and so what you look at is</p>
<p t="3273900" d="4720">at the moment or listen to is me because, in principle</p>
<p t="3279400" d="5120">I am the gateway to that set of accomplishments, at this moment</p>
<p t="3285080" d="940">and so</p>
<p t="3286920" d="1220">you focus on me</p>
<p t="3288480" d="2580">and that&#39;s because you value that</p>
<p t="3291580" d="4080">and so what that means is that you can&#39;t even look at the world without a value structure</p>
<p t="3296360" d="4820">you know it&#39;s chaos, if everything is equally unimportant or if everything is equally important</p>
<p t="3301940" d="4020">it&#39;s chaos, so a value system, structures</p>
<p t="3305960" d="3920">the very way that you perceive the world, and I don&#39;t mean that metaphysically</p>
<p t="3309880" d="2640">there is plenty of experiments that have demonstrated that</p>
<p t="3312520" d="5620">like the invisible gorilla experiment, how many of you know about the invisible gorilla experiment.  How many don&#39;t?</p>
<p t="3320720" d="840">Well,</p>
<p t="3323700" d="3520">Roughly speaking, what happens is that there are two teams</p>
<p t="3327220" d="3160">a white team dressed in white and a team dressed in black</p>
<p t="3330380" d="3460">and there is a video of them and the black team is passing a basketball ball back and forth</p>
<p t="3333840" d="2700">and the white team passing basketball back and forth</p>
<p t="3336540" d="4260">and you are supposed to count the times the basketball gets passed back and forth</p>
<p t="3340800" d="1540">there is only one basketball</p>
<p t="3342900" d="1760">and so, you know, you&#39;re diligent</p>
<p t="3345280" d="1400">for whatever reason</p>
<p t="3346860" d="2480">you do what the experimenter asks you</p>
<p t="3349340" d="3020">and you count the basketball tosses and you think</p>
<p t="3352360" d="2300">well that&#39;s not so hard, it&#39;s like 16</p>
<p t="3355180" d="2400">so you tell them 16, and they say,</p>
<p t="3357680" d="1600">Did you see the gorilla?</p>
<p t="3359940" d="3440">and half of you say, what are you talking about</p>
<p t="3364020" d="3620">and the experimenter says, let&#39;s watch again but this time, don&#39;t count</p>
<p t="3368280" d="3280">Well, sure enough, like 30 seconds into the video</p>
<p t="3372160" d="7000">and, you know, the players fill the video screen, it&#39;s not like they are 300 yards in the distance, you know, like little ants playing basketball, they&#39;re right</p>
<p t="3379160" d="2680">filling the screen, you can see their faces</p>
<p t="3382740" d="880">Sure enough,</p>
<p t="3383700" d="7000">minute into the video this guy in a gorilla suit, and he is not little, and neither is the gorilla suit, and he comes out</p>
<p t="3390700" d="5340">bangs his chest right in the middle of the screen for five seconds and then disappears</p>
<p t="3396280" d="7000">and half, more than half actually of people don&#39;t see that, and it is even worse, Dan Simon did another experiment, where</p>
<p t="3404500" d="4460">you are at a counter, you know at a store,  and there is a clerk there</p>
<p t="3408960" d="3200">you are talking to the clerk, and the clerk, goes down</p>
<p t="3413700" d="2940">hypothetically to get something, and then a different clerk pops up</p>
<p t="3416940" d="2680">and you think, Hey! I would notice that!</p>
<p t="3419700" d="940">but you don&#39;t</p>
<p t="3421560" d="2880">and you can even vary the clerk quite a bit,</p>
<p t="3424660" d="560">and,</p>
<p t="3425560" d="1360">people don&#39;t notice</p>
<p t="3427740" d="500">So,</p>
<p t="3429700" d="4240">We focus on very particular things and the reason we don&#39;t notice is because it doesn&#39;t actually matter</p>
<p t="3434040" d="1620">in terms of the ongoing,</p>
<p t="3436180" d="1860">our ongoing action at that point,</p>
<p t="3438200" d="1900">the clerk is interchangeable</p>
<p t="3440340" d="3460">as long as the entity there acts like a clerk</p>
<p t="3444240" d="1280">that&#39;s sufficient</p>
<p t="3458600" d="600">So,</p>
<p t="3459200" d="6220">belief systems structure your perceptions, value systems, we are going to call them value systems</p>
<p t="3465420" d="1900">they structure you perceptions</p>
<p t="3467640" d="2900">and they also guide you actions because</p>
<p t="3470860" d="2840">you act, in accordance with your values</p>
<p t="3473700" d="6720">conscious, or unconscious, you have values that you don&#39;t know about because you don&#39;t know yourself very well</p>
<p t="3481680" d="5120">You can tell that, that you have values that you don&#39;t know, very well, because</p>
<p t="3486800" d="4620">sometimes you get attracted to people that you know perfectly well that&#39;s a mistake</p>
<p t="3491480" d="5440">or, you are trying to tell yourself to study and you don&#39;t, and, you know so there&#39;s</p>
<p t="3496920" d="3240">You are not in control of yourself to any great degree,</p>
<p t="3500160" d="5380">some, and the more integrated you are the more control you have but, you are kind of a loose collection</p>
<p t="3505540" d="5420">arguing sub-personalities, and they are more or less directed towards a single goal,</p>
<p t="3510960" d="5900">but it depends on how committed you are to that goal, how much you have thought it through, much you buy into it,</p>
<p t="3516860" d="6260">how many of the contradictions in your world representation you have managed to iron out, and all of that</p>
<p t="3524080" d="620">So,</p>
<p t="3525860" d="2880">but in any case, it&#39;s value systems that</p>
<p t="3529840" d="4880">govern action and perception, and so, we are going to take an existential</p>
<p t="3536060" d="4660">perspective, a phenomenological and an existential perspective in this course, and</p>
<p t="3540720" d="2320">phenomenological means that we are going to</p>
<p t="3543120" d="2660">we are going to base our presuppositions on</p>
<p t="3546080" d="3840">the idea that what you experience is real, all of it</p>
<p t="3550340" d="7000">we are not really dividing the world into object and subject, that isn&#39;t how this particular approach works, it&#39;s more like</p>
<p t="3557340" d="3480">you have a field of experience, it includes things like pain,</p>
<p t="3560820" d="2760">which is not really something objective, I mean</p>
<p t="3564180" d="5280">but it&#39;s real, I mean, one of the things I&#39;ve come to understand is...don&#39;t....</p>
<p t="3569500" d="4160">You are not required to believe what I am telling you, by the way</p>
<p t="3574040" d="2960">If you have an argument</p>
<p t="3577740" d="3920">about, why some of this doesn&#39;t make sense</p>
<p t="3581820" d="8900">then, you know, follow that sucker, because I am trying to tell you what I have reached with regards to bedrock presuppositions, and I haven&#39;t been able to</p>
<p t="3591160" d="4080">put prybars underneath them, but that doesn&#39;t mean you won&#39;t</p>
<p t="3596980" d="3100">and, you know, you should try, anyways</p>
<p t="3604640" d="1040">Moral system,</p>
<p t="3606680" d="1800">tells you how to act  what to see,</p>
<p t="3609640" d="6260">and a shared moral system keeps your emotions under control, and fulfills your motivational needs</p>
<p t="3620360" d="1760">Now there is this old idea,</p>
<p t="3623020" d="1440">of David Hume&#39;s</p>
<p t="3625480" d="1200">and David Hume</p>
<p t="3628160" d="1000">famously,</p>
<p t="3630320" d="4640">posited, that you cannot derive and ought from and is</p>
<p t="3635920" d="2240">and what he meant by that was that</p>
<p t="3638620" d="3520">merely knowing the objective facts about something</p>
<p t="3643080" d="3840">does not tell you how to implement those facts in your life</p>
<p t="3646980" d="5440">and that&#39;s actually a gap, now, you could say, and I think that this is the case</p>
<p t="3652420" d="4480">that is a necessary consequence of the scientific endeavour, because</p>
<p t="3656900" d="6300">one of the things you are trying to do as a scientist is to strip away the value of the object, right, because</p>
<p t="3663460" d="4280">I don&#39;t care what your idiosyncratic notion of the object is</p>
<p t="3667900" d="3320">I want to know how you perceive the object</p>
<p t="3671220" d="3600">such that everyone else will perceive it at least that way</p>
<p t="3674820" d="3980">and so that takes the subjectivity completely out of it, and so it might just be a</p>
<p t="3678800" d="2660">necessary consequence of the scientific method</p>
<p t="3681540" d="3040">that it doesn&#39;t have a morality implicit in it</p>
<p t="3684840" d="7240">people argue about that, Sam Harris, for example, argues, he believes that we can come up with a scientific morality</p>
<p t="3692980" d="8880">I don&#39;t believe that, because I don&#39;t think that you can make rational judgments about value, it&#39;s too complicated</p>
<p t="3702020" d="4120">it&#39;s far to complicated, it&#39;s something that has to emerge, it can&#39;t be</p>
<p t="3708540" d="7600">I mean Marxism was supposed to be a scientific Utopia predicated on scientific principles, and all of that, and you know, it just didn&#39;t work</p>
<p t="3718980" d="880">Anyways,</p>
<p t="3720940" d="2080">so I kind of buy Hume&#39;s argument</p>
<p t="3723300" d="3040">that you cannot derive an ought from an is, now</p>
<p t="3728140" d="1480">that&#39;s a problem</p>
<p t="3730020" d="5260">first of all it&#39;s a problem because you have factual knowledge but you don&#39;t know how to implement it, you know, it&#39;s like</p>
<p t="3735280" d="5640">should you spend money on AIDS or should you spend money on cancer or should spend money on higher education</p>
<p t="3740920" d="2820">how the hell are you going to calculate that rationally</p>
<p t="3743740" d="3840">you can&#39;t because you just don&#39;t have the  information at hand</p>
<p t="3747780" d="1760">It&#39;s not possible to</p>
<p t="3749540" d="5460">you know, I worked for a U.N. committee at one point and, the U.N. committee had like a hundred</p>
<p t="3755540" d="7960">proposals for how the world could be improved, but there was no order to them, it&#39;s like it wasn&#39;t, this is more important than this, it&#39;s like, well</p>
<p t="3765060" d="4200">that&#39;s the end of that, you know, you have got to start with something and so that means you have to make something</p>
<p t="3769300" d="3200">more important that other things, obviously in your life</p>
<p t="3772500" d="3720">if everything is of equal importance then you are paralyzed</p>
<p t="3783920" d="3400">Now you know, it&#39;s a truism</p>
<p t="3787500" d="2640">and probably an oversimplfied one that</p>
<p t="3790440" d="4120">since the dawn of the scientific revolution</p>
<p t="3795340" d="1680">a wedge has been</p>
<p t="3797940" d="5200">driven through the heart of our societies, such that the moral systems that we</p>
<p t="3803680" d="1800">use to unite us</p>
<p t="3805760" d="3520">so those would be religious systems, fundementally</p>
<p t="3810480" d="4400">have been subject to an intense critique from the scientists, and</p>
<p t="3814880" d="2160">you know it&#39;s a pretty effective critique</p>
<p t="3818140" d="3920">even if you have maintained a traditional faith, it&#39;s like</p>
<p t="3824980" d="2400">the scientific onslaught is no joke</p>
<p t="3828280" d="660">and</p>
<p t="3830800" d="2880">that&#39;s a problem as far as I can tell because</p>
<p t="3833680" d="4800">and the problem is that you are still left with the problem of how you should act</p>
<p t="3838680" d="4000">and Nietzsche, the philosopher Nietzsche he would say that</p>
<p t="3842980" d="3600">we are running on the fumes of Christianity in the West</p>
<p t="3846900" d="6440">because over it&#39;s thousand years of domination, let&#39;s say 1500 years of absolute domination</p>
<p t="3853420" d="6080">it produced a consensus of morality that was predicated on metaphysical presuppositions</p>
<p t="3859660" d="2400">and that organized societies</p>
<p t="3862080" d="4960">and those societies are predicated on certain beliefs, like the belief in</p>
<p t="3867260" d="3880">really I would say in something divine inhabits each individual</p>
<p t="3871140" d="4140">you know, that sort of the presumption that is embedded in law, sort of the idea that underlies</p>
<p t="3875280" d="1800">the idea of natural rights, right</p>
<p t="3877080" d="3880">there is something about you that is so valuable that even the law</p>
<p t="3880960" d="5840">has to bow to it even if you are reprehensible, even if you are convicted and reprehensible</p>
<p t="3887620" d="1600">Now that&#39;s, man</p>
<p t="3889220" d="4620">the idea that people came up with that idea, that&#39;s a bloody miracle, you know because</p>
<p t="3894080" d="1360">generally speaking</p>
<p t="3895440" d="5680">your proclivity is that if someone is being even accused of doing something , the general human proclivity</p>
<p t="3901120" d="4440">is that if someone is just been accused of doing something terrible that&#39;s enough so that you can</p>
<p t="3905560" d="2540">stone them to death or do whatever you are going to do with them</p>
<p t="3908380" d="3280">presumption of innocence before guilt, good God</p>
<p t="3911660" d="4320">of all the things that aren&#39;t automatic, that&#39;s got to top the list</p>
<p t="3916060" d="5040">you know, it&#39;s unbelievable that occurs and it is interesting to me because</p>
<p t="3921760" d="1400">it seems to me that</p>
<p t="3924560" d="4460">that presupposition that there is something valuable, transcendent about each individual</p>
<p t="3930060" d="3680">I wouldn&#39;t call that a scientific presupposition, but</p>
<p t="3933740" d="3460">it seems to be a highly functional presupposition, right</p>
<p t="3937380" d="1600">I think, in that</p>
<p t="3939340" d="7000">it isn&#39;t unreasonable to notice that societies that have valued the individual</p>
<p t="3946940" d="4640">and made the law, subject to the individual even with regard to voting</p>
<p t="3951580" d="4320">because that&#39;s basically what voting does, it puts sovereignty the hands of the people</p>
<p t="3955900" d="2340">those societies actually seem to work</p>
<p t="3958940" d="3720">Now, whether they will work for the next 300 years</p>
<p t="3962680" d="5760">who the hell knows, but they work pretty well for the last 500 years, let&#39;s say</p>
<p t="3969320" d="4640">We&#39;ve got it pretty good right now, and, you know, I suspect most of you</p>
<p t="3974280" d="4560">are rather pleased that the law recognizes you value  as individuals</p>
<p t="3978840" d="3100">and you take that for granted, right, you think you have rights</p>
<p t="3982760" d="5080">and of course the rights you have, natural rights, are</p>
<p t="3988000" d="2600">logical consequences of your</p>
<p t="3990600" d="4800">transcendent value, and that is nested in, this is Nietzche&#39;s observation</p>
<p t="3995400" d="2600">that is nested in a set of metaphysical beliefs</p>
<p t="3998180" d="2320">and his idea was that if you wipe out,</p>
<p t="4000500" d="1880">wipe out the metaphysical beliefs</p>
<p t="4002380" d="4080">eventually you wipe out the whole system because you have knocked out the cornerstone</p>
<p t="4007080" d="3280">and it might take a long time for the thing to shake</p>
<p t="4010500" d="2200">and fall, but, it will</p>
<p t="4014580" d="3200">now, whether he was right or not is hard to say</p>
<p t="4018900" d="5680">it looks to me like what has happened since Nietzsche announced the death of God in say</p>
<p t="4024820" d="1960">the late 1800&#39;s is that</p>
<p t="4026780" d="3340">Western society has oscillated between extremes</p>
<p t="4030120" d="1780">you know, extremes on the right</p>
<p t="4032260" d="1060">Germany</p>
<p t="4033640" d="1360">extremes on the left</p>
<p t="4035660" d="1640">and you know, with</p>
<p t="4037540" d="3280">the democracies, at least the other democracies</p>
<p t="4041520" d="4720">the democracies managing to stay the course somewhere down the middle</p>
<p t="4046800" d="500">but</p>
<p t="4050980" d="3520">but it is not obvious to me that that can be maintained</p>
<p t="4054500" d="2060">without the underlying metaphysics</p>
<p t="4057240" d="2400">and that is a problem because</p>
<p t="4060440" d="3360">whatever you might say about the underlying metaphysics</p>
<p t="4065100" d="2720">it is not true the way that science is true</p>
<p t="4067820" d="5480">and that could be OK because there might be more than one form of truth, in fact, I think there is</p>
<p t="4074100" d="2800">I think that there is pragmatic truth, and</p>
<p t="4076900" d="3440">I think that pragmatic truth is actually deeper than scientific truth</p>
<p t="4080780" d="6440">and pragmatic truth is the truths that enable you to act in a manner that best</p>
<p t="4088200" d="6560">that improves the probability, roughly speaking, of your existence  and reproduction maximally</p>
<p t="4095720" d="3680">that is a Darwinian idea, one of the things about the Darwinian theory</p>
<p t="4100600" d="3920">this kind off puts it in opposition to scientific materialism I would say, is that</p>
<p t="4105480" d="5200">the Darwinian theory is that you do not have privileged knowledge of the world</p>
<p t="4110860" d="3120">and you can actually tell that because, you die</p>
<p t="4113980" d="3760">if you knew enough about the world, you would not die, and you do die</p>
<p t="4117740" d="2480">and so you are embodied theory of sorts</p>
<p t="4120220" d="3980">and that theory is good enough to get you along about 80 years and</p>
<p t="4125220" d="7000">produce some reasonable probability that you&#39;ll have children and that they will survive, that&#39;s it, man, that&#39;s what you have managed after</p>
<p t="4136560" d="1840">3 billion years of evolution</p>
<p t="4138440" d="1840">it&#39;s a good enough solution</p>
<p t="4140280" d="2980">it&#39;s a good enough way of acting, and we don&#39;t know a better way of acting, and</p>
<p t="4143400" d="5880">our world conceptions are actually nested inside the Darwinian system</p>
<p t="4150100" d="4000">and , they might be predicated on pragmatic truths</p>
<p t="4154140" d="5140">rather than objective truths, pragmatic truths are truths that have functional utility</p>
<p t="4159600" d="3480">and we are alive, we care about being alive</p>
<p t="4163760" d="2320">we tend to use our theories as tools</p>
<p t="4166080" d="2460">it&#39;s possible that our theories are tools</p>
<p t="4169200" d="2340">and that they are tools to help us stay alive</p>
<p t="4177000" d="3920">Now, I was reading a bit about Camille Paglia, the other day</p>
<p t="4181760" d="500">and ah,</p>
<p t="4182460" d="3840">I have noticed some similarities between, she&#39;s a famous</p>
<p t="4188860" d="2340">gadfly, I would say of feminists</p>
<p t="4191200" d="3500">classic modern feminists, although she would regard herself as a feminist</p>
<p t="4194800" d="4000">Unbelievably smart, like if you want to watch someone whose</p>
<p t="4199040" d="1040">verbally</p>
<p t="4201200" d="3280">Who has verbal mastery beyond belief</p>
<p t="4205460" d="4640">You could watch Camille Paglia, she seems a little manic to me, she can</p>
<p t="4210100" d="4940">rap off an argument at a rate that&#39;s just mind-boggling and is very coherent, and</p>
<p t="4215360" d="4580">she tends to shred her opponents in arguments, she is so brilliant</p>
<p t="4220640" d="7000">She said something interesting, and she has been influenced by some of the same people I have been influenced by, she liked this book</p>
<p t="4227640" d="4340">by Erich Neumann called &quot; The Origins and History of Consciousness&quot; which</p>
<p t="4231980" d="4260">I would recommend if you are interested in Jungian theory, Carl Jung</p>
<p t="4236240" d="4560">It&#39;s a good introduction to Jungian theory and it&#39;s about the development of consciousness</p>
<p t="4240920" d="500">and,</p>
<p t="4244440" d="4160">It&#39;s predicated like Jung&#39;s work, and Joseph Campbell&#39;s work</p>
<p t="4248600" d="5500">and Mircea Eliade&#39;s work, all which has been criticized or ignored by the post-modernists</p>
<p t="4255920" d="4400">Predicated on the idea that human beings have a central narrative</p>
<p t="4261060" d="760">and that,</p>
<p t="4264340" d="1760">that central narrative is</p>
<p t="4267980" d="500">the</p>
<p t="4269060" d="2340">dramatic expression of</p>
<p t="4272420" d="2480">the necessary  human system of values</p>
<p t="4276160" d="1600">and that is built into us</p>
<p t="4278680" d="4000">it&#39;s part of our nature, we have a nature as human beings</p>
<p t="4282980" d="3420">we&#39;re not, infinitely malleable by culture</p>
<p t="4288000" d="4080">which is a post-modernist claim and a dangerous one</p>
<p t="4294460" d="2240">It&#39;s dangerous if we have a nature</p>
<p t="4298140" d="3200">Paglia has this idea, that</p>
<p t="4302100" d="6800">the reason that you come to university and you study the humanities, or the proper reason if you do that</p>
<p t="4309060" d="1140">is not to</p>
<p t="4311440" d="4040">engage in premature and destructive critisism</p>
<p t="4315480" d="3040">of something that you don&#39;t even yet understand</p>
<p t="4319120" d="1280">but to,</p>
<p t="4320940" d="2700">learn, as much as you can about</p>
<p t="4324580" d="2560">art and literature and poetry</p>
<p t="4327780" d="1120">and drama</p>
<p t="4330160" d="1040">and fiction</p>
<p t="4331800" d="1600">and religious thinking</p>
<p t="4333660" d="3120">and this all kind of a, you can think about it as a</p>
<p t="4337000" d="1000">What is that?</p>
<p t="4338620" d="2080">What is all that? It&#39;s art,</p>
<p t="4341300" d="4040">it&#39;s culture, music belongs in that category</p>
<p t="4345340" d="4800">and like, what the hell, what about music, it&#39;s like everyone loves it, or almost everyone</p>
<p t="4350840" d="1220">It&#39;s a mystery,</p>
<p t="4352060" d="2040">you listen to music and it is very meaningful</p>
<p t="4354120" d="4080">I mean music gets people through some pretty dark times, why?</p>
<p t="4359000" d="2080">It&#39;s not obvious, that for sure</p>
<p t="4361080" d="4620">you know, and in most cultures music plays a very central role in identity formation,and</p>
<p t="4365700" d="4180">you guys, I think you will probably find as you age that your favorite music</p>
<p t="4369880" d="4180">will be the music that you listened to between the ages of 16 and 20</p>
<p t="4374060" d="1780">It&#39;s kind of like it imprints on you</p>
<p t="4375940" d="3120">and it defines a, maybe it defines a generation</p>
<p t="4379480" d="3680">and maybe, in our tribal past, and this is highly likely</p>
<p t="4385280" d="3760">When you were being inculcated into the tribal culture,</p>
<p t="4390100" d="3120">That was inculcated with dance, and with masks</p>
<p t="4393220" d="5040">and with music, all at the same time, so you are invited to participate in this drama</p>
<p t="4398260" d="2220">and to take your place in this drama</p>
<p t="4400480" d="5340">and to think of that as a representation of the objective world is just not right, that isn&#39;t what it is</p>
<p t="4406160" d="2460">It&#39;s an invitation to a drama</p>
<p t="4410100" d="3680">now then the question might be, well, is the drama real?</p>
<p t="4414060" d="1680">and the answer to that is,</p>
<p t="4415860" d="2320">It depends on what you mean by real.</p>
<p t="4418940" d="4560">I think that great dramas are more real than real, they&#39;re hyperreal</p>
<p t="4424440" d="820">They&#39;re</p>
<p t="4429680" d="4560">They&#39;re hyper real because they provide guidelines about how to act that are abstract</p>
<p t="4434240" d="6220">and even perhaps generic, but applicable across an extraordinary broad range of situations</p>
<p t="4440840" d="1200">So, imagine this</p>
<p t="4442040" d="1760">you know, you get up in the morning</p>
<p t="4444480" d="1580">you do a bunch of things</p>
<p t="4446060" d="3320">and someone asks you what you are doing, what you did and you</p>
<p t="4451060" d="3900">you know, you tell them, well the first thing I did this morning was open my eyes</p>
<p t="4454960" d="3940">the second thing was think about whether or not I wanted to go back to sleep, and then</p>
<p t="4458900" d="3640">you know, I took off my blankets and then I put my feet on the floor</p>
<p t="4462540" d="4440">and I stood up, and I was blinking while I was doing all this, and I was also breathing</p>
<p t="4467040" d="760">and then,</p>
<p t="4467800" d="3420">you know I looked for my clothes, and do you really want to listen to that guy?</p>
<p t="4471220" d="4300">You don&#39;t want to listen to that guy. It&#39;s like, why are you telling me that ?</p>
<p t="4475520" d="2300">I want you to tell me something interesting.</p>
<p t="4478700" d="3600">Well, what is it that is interesting? And why isn&#39;t that interesting?</p>
<p t="4482800" d="1200">It&#39;s not obvious.</p>
<p t="4484000" d="5160">So, so then imagine the guy actually tells you a pretty good story, a little adventure.</p>
<p t="4489900" d="1200">Probably,</p>
<p t="4491800" d="2700">he was doing something normal, something unexpected happened</p>
<p t="4494700" d="2560">he had to conjure up some new responses</p>
<p t="4497260" d="3820">he either settled the problem, or he didn&#39;t settle the problem, yeah, you&#39;re interested in that.</p>
<p t="4501260" d="4400">Especially if he settled the problem because if he can tell you how</p>
<p t="4506300" d="2700">when he encountered some unexplored territory</p>
<p t="4509160" d="2240">he was able to sew it back together</p>
<p t="4511820" d="2720">then, maybe you can do that thing happens and</p>
<p t="4514540" d="4040">that&#39;s pretty cheap wisdom for you, he had to go through all the aggravation of</p>
<p t="4518580" d="2140">figuring it out and all you have to do is listen</p>
<p t="4521120" d="4940">you know, and that&#39;s kind of a classic story, the classic story roughly speaking is</p>
<p t="4527220" d="2480">There is a guy, women, doesn&#39;t matter</p>
<p t="4530020" d="1520">going about their life</p>
<p t="4531940" d="4960">relatively normally, something blindsides them and they are in a state of</p>
<p t="4538040" d="600">chaos</p>
<p t="4539800" d="1400">chaos is a place</p>
<p t="4541820" d="4600">chaos is the place that you end up when what you are doing</p>
<p t="4547240" d="7000">and the world stop matching, and the chaos can be of different degrees , you know you could wake up and find that</p>
<p t="4554240" d="3460">your house was burgled, you could wake up and find that a parent has</p>
<p t="4557860" d="3400">Alzheimer&#39;s, or some fatal disease or that you do</p>
<p t="4561260" d="4460">or that your whole family was murdered, or that there is a war starting, you know</p>
<p t="4566580" d="2860">there are different degrees of chaos and</p>
<p t="4569660" d="1520">I think that you can</p>
<p t="4571880" d="3200">Quantify the chaos by calculating</p>
<p t="4575460" d="1020">how much of</p>
<p t="4577180" d="4780">what you do and expect is likely to be disrupted by the event</p>
<p t="4582640" d="6320">now, because that, the more disruption, the more destabilized you are going to be, which is why</p>
<p t="4588960" d="4760">if someone tells you that you are going to perish painfully in 3 months, it&#39;s like</p>
<p t="4596640" d="1100">That&#39;s a bad one</p>
<p t="4599080" d="4920">you&#39;re really in an unexpected territory there, nothing that you assumed that was real,</p>
<p t="4604140" d="3300">roughly speaking, in the world is real anymore</p>
<p t="4609460" d="2960">We like to watch people, in their normal life</p>
<p t="4613240" d="1680">blindsided by something</p>
<p t="4616780" d="4960">experiencing this interregnum of chaos where they explore</p>
<p t="4621820" d="1840">and gather new information</p>
<p t="4623660" d="5780">and retool their character, or retool the world because either of those would work as a solution</p>
<p t="4629680" d="2320">and then, come out the other side</p>
<p t="4632400" d="2180">and things are better than they were to begin with</p>
<p t="4634580" d="4080">or at least as good, but, better is better, that&#39;s a happy ending, right?</p>
<p t="4638660" d="4340">That&#39;s a happy ending, that&#39;s a comedy. technically speaking, and so</p>
<p t="4644300" d="2380">what you want, you want your life to be a comedy</p>
<p t="4647060" d="2800">not that it&#39;s supposed to be funny because</p>
<p t="4649860" d="2720">comedy doesn&#39;t have to be funny, technically speaking</p>
<p t="4652580" d="1860">it&#39;s just the opposite of tragedy</p>
<p t="4654440" d="4920">tragedy is when you are going along pretty well and you get blindsided, and that&#39;s that</p>
<p t="4659360" d="5120">and, you know, that can certainly happen, it happens to people all the time. It&#39;s a comedy that you want.</p>
<p t="4670180" d="620">Now,</p>
<p t="4671820" d="2000">what I hope to provide you with</p>
<p t="4675080" d="2360">is a magic code</p>
<p t="4679140" d="3200">You know, there was a book published a while back</p>
<p t="4684740" d="1680">Tom Hanks was in the movie</p>
<p t="4686640" d="4720">he was a Harvard professor who went around solving symbolic mysteries</p>
<p t="4691360" d="1780">Do you remember what is was called?</p>
<p t="4693520" d="3720">The Da Vinci Code, every one liked that, it sold a lot</p>
<p t="4698760" d="4640">and it was full of little mysteries, it was full of hints that there was more to the world than</p>
<p t="4703680" d="3380">you think, and, which is definitely true</p>
<p t="4707060" d="5740">and that, you know, there is a way of getting access to that knowledge and it would be really worthwhile</p>
<p t="4713020" d="5760">and people like that idea, and the reason for that is because it is actually, it&#39;s true.</p>
<p t="4719760" d="760">It&#39;s true</p>
<p t="4722300" d="1100">it&#39;s true like</p>
<p t="4724200" d="3840">like fiction is true, so OK let&#39;s go back to the guy who is telling you about his morning</p>
<p t="4728980" d="1560">well he tells you something exciting</p>
<p t="4731540" d="3440">well then imagine that 10 people tell you exciting,</p>
<p t="4735340" d="5700">and then, you extract out the pattern of them dealing with this problem</p>
<p t="4741040" d="3960">from that, and do then you have a, that&#39;s what you do when you are an author</p>
<p t="4745980" d="4400">Right,  because in a book you don&#39;t want the book exactly to be about</p>
<p t="4750520" d="3980">what ordinary people do in ordinary times in thier life</p>
<p t="4755100" d="4700">You already know hoe to be ordinary during ordinary  times of your life, what, that&#39;s not useful</p>
<p t="4759800" d="3440">you know, you wouldn&#39;t watch a video tape of yourself</p>
<p t="4763240" d="5220">Imagine you videotaped yourself during a day, and then the next day you watched that</p>
<p t="4768640" d="2640">It&#39;s like, God, who would want to do that</p>
<p t="4771800" d="3520">So what seem to happen in stories is that they distill</p>
<p t="4775620" d="1340">They distill</p>
<p t="4776960" d="2860">so they, they watch people, people watch people</p>
<p t="4779820" d="4140">and then they tell stories about what they see, but they leave a lot out of those stories</p>
<p t="4784160" d="3200">Everything that is boring, hopefully, and then</p>
<p t="4787580" d="3200">more and more stories  about exciting things get</p>
<p t="4790780" d="5360">sort of aggregated, and then maybe a great writer comes along and writes something really, really interesting</p>
<p t="4796560" d="2560">profound character transformations</p>
<p t="4799120" d="1420">and then, well you say &quot;That&#39;s fiction&quot;</p>
<p t="4800540" d="1820">and then you say, &quot;That&#39;s not true&quot;</p>
<p t="4802540" d="1440">because it&#39;s fiction</p>
<p t="4804500" d="2740">but then, then maybe that&#39;s not right</p>
<p t="4809280" d="1740">maybe it&#39;s more than true</p>
<p t="4811660" d="4520">because who wants the truth, the truth is mundane reality and you have already got that mastered</p>
<p t="4816460" d="3460">What you want is the distillation of</p>
<p t="4820340" d="1680">interesting experience</p>
<p t="4822020" d="5000">and you might think, well why is it interesting, well that a really good question, because you don&#39;t actually know</p>
<p t="4827020" d="4900">and believe me, you really don&#39;t know because you will be interested in things that just don&#39;t make any sense at all</p>
<p t="4831920" d="5720">I am going to walk a bit today through Pinocchio, and we will do that more the next time too</p>
<p t="4837640" d="5360">You know, but I want to tell you a little bit about that movie to begin with just so you know how crazy you are</p>
<p t="4843000" d="4700">so, you know the plot, how many people have seen the Disney movie Pinocchio?</p>
<p t="4848400" d="1440">so lot&#39;s of people, so</p>
<p t="4850020" d="1520">that&#39;s strange enough</p>
<p t="4851600" d="2720">in itself that so many people have seen it</p>
<p t="4854320" d="3620">and it&#39;s worth thinking about, you know, you tend to show your kids that movie</p>
<p t="4858260" d="2640">and, but if you think about the movie it&#39;s</p>
<p t="4861300" d="4600">you are doing some pretty weird things when you are sitting there watching that movie, man. First of all,</p>
<p t="4866180" d="3860">it&#39;s drawings, right and they are low resolution drawings</p>
<p t="4870040" d="4680">You don&#39;t care, and you watch the Simpsons or maybe, what&#39;s that called</p>
<p t="4876500" d="3240">the one that&#39;s been concentrating on political correctness so much
[Students]: South Park</p>
<p t="4879940" d="3440">South Park!  God that animation man, it&#39;s just awful</p>
<p t="4883380" d="2880">Right, it is just horrible, it couldn&#39;t be worse</p>
<p t="4886780" d="1400">you don&#39;t care, like,</p>
<p t="4888680" d="2380">Round heads, smile</p>
<p t="4891060" d="3700">little bit of shuffling, that&#39;s a person as far as you&#39;re concerned</p>
<p t="4894760" d="4120">it&#39;s just irrelevant and if it was higher resolution, it wouldn&#39;t help</p>
<p t="4898880" d="2180">You just need the bare bones, right</p>
<p t="4901200" d="1980">to hang your perceptions on</p>
<p t="4903900" d="640">So,</p>
<p t="4905740" d="3760">so you watch this drawing, that&#39;s Pinocchio, beautiful drawings,</p>
<p t="4910000" d="1520">animated in a sequence</p>
<p t="4911520" d="4000">You are not watching something real, you are watching a pure construction</p>
<p t="4915520" d="2640">and then you think about the plot, it&#39;s like</p>
<p t="4918160" d="3900">It&#39;s completely absurd, everything about it is absurd, it&#39;s like</p>
<p t="4922060" d="2260">Well, one of the characters is a bug</p>
<p t="4924820" d="5140">and he turns out to be like the conscience, and so, what the hell is with that?</p>
<p t="4930420" d="4960">and then, another character is this puppet, marionette, and,</p>
<p t="4935860" d="5480">you know, somehow he gets free of his strings and then goes on this adventure and then</p>
<p t="4941960" d="2480">and then you know he gets enticed into</p>
<p t="4944520" d="1660">various nefarious</p>
<p t="4946680" d="2400">places by a fox and a cat</p>
<p t="4949380" d="3160">and then, he rescues his father from a whale</p>
<p t="4952540" d="4180">and you don&#39;t even know how his father got in the whale, it&#39;s like the last time you see his father</p>
<p t="4956720" d="3680">he was in a rainstorm and the next thing that happens is, he is in a whale</p>
<p t="4960400" d="3300">and you are sitting there thinking, &quot;Hey, no problem, this all makes sense.&quot;</p>
<p t="4964080" d="1680">It&#39;s like, what? really?</p>
<p t="4966220" d="660">Why?</p>
<p t="4967240" d="1680">How does that make sense?</p>
<p t="4969440" d="2160">Well the answer is you don&#39;t know</p>
<p t="4972020" d="2080">That&#39;s the thing that is so cool</p>
<p t="4974100" d="2280">you don&#39;t know, you don&#39;t even know what you are watching</p>
<p t="4976700" d="1440">but it doesn&#39;t matter</p>
<p t="4978140" d="4120">You watch it, and you are interested in it, you want to see what the hell happens to this puppet</p>
<p t="4982260" d="2920">You want to see if he ends up becoming a real boy.</p>
<p t="4985380" d="2860">because there&#39;s, it seems important</p>
<p t="4991200" d="2400">Well, you say, &quot;Is Pinocchio true?&quot;</p>
<p t="4996840" d="2080">Well that&#39;s a stupid question.</p>
<p t="5002240" d="5040">It&#39;s partly a stupid question because the answer is it depends on you mean by true</p>
<p t="5008520" d="620">and,</p>
<p t="5011180" d="1620">it isn&#39;t obvious to me</p>
<p t="5013940" d="1600">what you should mean</p>
<p t="5016480" d="720">when you</p>
<p t="5018300" d="1900">say that something is true</p>
<p t="5021020" d="2880">and the reason it is not obvious is because,</p>
<p t="5024400" d="7600">We have this idea in our society, and it&#39;s a very profound idea and that idea is that the ultimate truth is scientific truth</p>
<p t="5033120" d="4240">That that tells us about the nature of the world, and it does that</p>
<p t="5037360" d="4700">in a final way in some sense, there is no brooking any arguments about it</p>
<p t="5042060" d="7300">The physicists have got it right, and that&#39;s why they can make hydrogen bombs, and that&#39;s a pretty good demonstration of their being right</p>
<p t="5053140" d="3540">but you don&#39;t act as if that&#39;s true</p>
<p t="5057640" d="1120">and you don&#39;t</p>
<p t="5060800" d="4320">and you watch things and pay attention to things and are captivated by things</p>
<p t="5065120" d="2720">that aren&#39;t predicated on those assumptions</p>
<p t="5068960" d="4980">and, it seems, to me, that</p>
<p t="5076280" d="3640">There is a problem of what the world is made out of, but there is a bigger problem</p>
<p t="5079920" d="3860">and that is the problem of how you should conduct yourself in the world</p>
<p t="5083780" d="4060">And that is what you really want to know, people want to know that more than anything</p>
<p t="5087840" d="5440">Because you need to know, it&#39;s like, here you guys are in university, you don&#39;t know what you are doing</p>
<p t="5093280" d="1920">I mean, some of you know more than others</p>
<p t="5095200" d="2320">but you are at the beginning of your life and</p>
<p t="5097520" d="2400">life is very complex and chaotic and</p>
<p t="5099920" d="3520">It isn&#39;t exactly obvious, you know, what kind of relationship you should</p>
<p t="5103440" d="2340">form, or what sort of character you should develop</p>
<p t="5105780" d="1940">or what you are going to do for a job, or</p>
<p t="5107720" d="4400">what&#39;s the meaning of life, that&#39;s a good one,  what&#39;s the meaning of life</p>
<p t="5112120" d="6340">Well, and you know, people come to university, at least many of them, and that&#39;s kind of what they want to find out</p>
<p t="5118700" d="2780">Now Paglia, her notion is that</p>
<p t="5122120" d="4320">you could think about it this way, is that articulated knowledge</p>
<p t="5127340" d="3720">is embedded in inarticulate knowledge</p>
<p t="5132760" d="2160">and inarticulate knowledge is,</p>
<p t="5136520" d="2600">a domain of literature and art</p>
<p t="5140420" d="1880">high culture let&#39;s say</p>
<p t="5143000" d="3320">and it&#39;s, we sort of know what it means</p>
<p t="5146320" d="3960">but we don&#39;t know exactly know what it means, it means more than we know</p>
<p t="5151300" d="2640">and then outside of that is what we don&#39;t know at all</p>
<p t="5153940" d="4000">and that&#39;s an idea that Jung developed as well and maybe Paglia picked it up from Jung</p>
<p t="5157940" d="2220">because Jung believed that</p>
<p t="5161720" d="2380">you know, there was this domain that we had mastered</p>
<p t="5164220" d="1280">in every domain, and then</p>
<p t="5165500" d="4040">there was domain outside of that you could think of as unexplored</p>
<p t="5169540" d="5600">territory and what we met unexplored territory with was our creative imagination</p>
<p t="5175140" d="2860">and what we were trying to do with our creative imagination is to</p>
<p t="5178220" d="5280">figure out how to deal with that unexplored territory, we are producing dramas</p>
<p t="5183880" d="5680">that we could act out that would help us deal with what we still hadn&#39;t mastered</p>
<p t="5189560" d="3260">and outside of that there is just what we don&#39;t know at all</p>
<p t="5193940" d="4120">and Paglia&#39;s idea, and this was Jung&#39;s idea was that</p>
<p t="5202580" d="5020">without understanding that surround</p>
<p t="5210260" d="1360">you are too atomized</p>
<p t="5213000" d="3040">you are not part of your historical tradition</p>
<p t="5216440" d="3600">you haven&#39;t incorporated the spirit of your ancestors</p>
<p t="5220440" d="1320">who built all this</p>
<p t="5222400" d="2400">you&#39;re just here now</p>
<p t="5225600" d="820">and,</p>
<p t="5226420" d="4900">and you don&#39;t know what to do either, you don&#39;t know how to maintain your culture and you don&#39;t know how to serve it</p>
<p t="5231660" d="700">and,</p>
<p t="5232360" d="3460">you know you might say why should you serve your culture and,</p>
<p t="5235820" d="3860">well I have a hypothesis about that, you know</p>
<p t="5240340" d="2820">You can think about this, I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s true but</p>
<p t="5243320" d="4000">People ask what the meaning of life is, and it seems to me that</p>
<p t="5249140" d="4080">Meaning is proportionate to the adoption of responsibility</p>
<p t="5254200" d="1920">You know, like let&#39;s say have</p>
<p t="5257300" d="2640">a little sister who&#39;s like three</p>
<p t="5262300" d="2080">you are going to take care of her</p>
<p t="5264720" d="3280">Questioning whether that is a good idea seems stupid</p>
<p t="5268580" d="2740">You know what I mean, it just doesn&#39;t seem like the right kind of question</p>
<p t="5271340" d="3000">It&#39;s like, well obviously</p>
<p t="5274520" d="3640">self evidently, let&#39;s say, that&#39;s what you do</p>
<p t="5278320" d="3360">and, do you find it meaningful, it&#39;s like probably</p>
<p t="5281680" d="2240">you know, interacting with a little kid</p>
<p t="5284600" d="4240">when I had little kids, you know when they were like two and under</p>
<p t="5288840" d="1820">we took them out to seetheir</p>
<p t="5291060" d="2480">relatives and they were older people</p>
<p t="5293540" d="3620">you know, they watched that two year old like it was a fire</p>
<p t="5298140" d="3840">you know, every second that that little kid was in the room</p>
<p t="5302220" d="1860">every single adult was</p>
<p t="5304440" d="4260">focused on, focused on , on him or her</p>
<p t="5311180" d="2960">That is something that people attend to , and</p>
<p t="5314220" d="6240">that&#39;s a source of meaning and, what else is meaningful, well your family relationships are meaningful to you and</p>
<p t="5321040" d="4960">maybe the responsibility that you adopt as a friend, that seems meaningful</p>
<p t="5326020" d="4800">maybe your decision to pursue a particular career and be of some utility</p>
<p t="5330860" d="2620">in society, you know, part of that&#39;s</p>
<p t="5333500" d="5200">governed by your desire to establish some security and get ahead, it&#39;s fine but</p>
<p t="5339460" d="880">You are also</p>
<p t="5342000" d="7000">playing an integral role in the maintenance of the structure that supports you and, my observation has been that</p>
<p t="5349660" d="4120">in my clinical practices people just have a hell of a time if they don&#39;t have</p>
<p t="5354020" d="2720">if they don&#39;t slot in somewhere, you know</p>
<p t="5356740" d="4800">You know, I got to go to work at 9:00 in the morning and you know I have got this rigid schedule, it&#39;s like</p>
<p t="5362760" d="7000">It&#39;s probably a good idea to be grateful for that, because what I have noticed is that if people pull out from those externally</p>
<p t="5369980" d="1840">scaffolded systems</p>
<p t="5372660" d="940">they drift</p>
<p t="5373620" d="7000">they get depressed, they get anxious, they don&#39;t know what to do with themselves you know they are kind of like sled dogs with no sled</p>
<p t="5381300" d="6720">and we are kind of like sled dogs as far as I can tell, beasts of burden, we need a load, man, we need a load</p>
<p t="5388020" d="500">and</p>
<p t="5389800" d="2880">the question is what sort of load do you need</p>
<p t="5393080" d="3160">and here is why I think we need, we need that</p>
<p t="5398540" d="1200">You know, there is</p>
<p t="5399740" d="3840">I&#39;ve been thinking about how to figure out what is real for a long time, and,</p>
<p t="5403580" d="1920">because I am an existentialist</p>
<p t="5405500" d="6080">I&#39;m operating under the presupposition that you can tell what people believe by watching how they act</p>
<p t="5411920" d="1560">I don&#39;t care what they say,</p>
<p t="5413800" d="5660">I don&#39;t care what their statements are about their view of reality</p>
<p t="5419780" d="5420">because the correlation, the relationship between that and their actual actions is, not</p>
<p t="5425560" d="3760">certainly not perfect and sometimes doesn&#39;t even exist</p>
<p t="5430900" d="2800">One thing that I&#39;ve noticed is that people</p>
<p t="5434060" d="2160">no one argues with their own pain</p>
<p t="5439120" d="1760">Everyone who hurts</p>
<p t="5441860" d="2640">acts as if they believe that pain is real</p>
<p t="5448260" d="1240">So we could say</p>
<p t="5450280" d="1920">the ultimate reality is pain</p>
<p t="5453480" d="1440">That&#39;s how people act</p>
<p t="5455660" d="4800">it&#39;s in keeping with the claims of many religious tradiations, you know</p>
<p t="5460660" d="1480">The Jews are always</p>
<p t="5462500" d="2160">recollecting past pain</p>
<p t="5464900" d="8820">I mean the Christian God is a crucified person, I mean there is a fair bit of pain there, for the Buddhists the fundamental maxim is that life is suffering</p>
<p t="5473720" d="3320">and it seems to me that there is a metaphysical claim there</p>
<p t="5477440" d="2080">the metaphysical claim is that</p>
<p t="5480740" d="1320">pain is real</p>
<p t="5484480" d="3140">now of course it depends on what you mean by real</p>
<p t="5488460" d="4560">but people act as if their pain is real, so that&#39;s a good place to start</p>
<p t="5495460" d="4380">Now, that poses a problem</p>
<p t="5504820" d="1500">Life is a pain</p>
<p t="5507240" d="3040">Life is suffering, let&#39;s say, and why is that?</p>
<p t="5511260" d="3560">Well, it&#39;s because you can be broken</p>
<p t="5515500" d="1500">hurt and destroyed</p>
<p t="5517920" d="880">So,</p>
<p t="5519500" d="3760">that seems pretty self evident and  worse you know it</p>
<p t="5523640" d="4400">and that makes people unique, like, that&#39;s our self conciousness, right?</p>
<p t="5528040" d="3700">That&#39;s really what separates us in some sense from other creatures</p>
<p t="5531740" d="4340">I mean, other creatures have some self conciousness, like a chimp</p>
<p t="5536080" d="3340">can learn to recognize itself in a mirror, and so can a dolphin, but</p>
<p t="5540220" d="4160">You know that&#39;s pretty bare bones self conciousness, you know</p>
<p t="5544420" d="3840">real self consciousness is the knowledge of your borders</p>
<p t="5548260" d="4180">and not only in space, but in time</p>
<p t="5553340" d="4640">and as far as I can tell human beings are the only creatures that discovered the future</p>
<p t="5557980" d="4760">and that&#39;s really good because we can plan for the future, but it&#39;s really bad because, you know</p>
<p t="5564160" d="4400">the future is finite and that a big shock to the old system</p>
<p t="5570240" d="5340">and it&#39;s the existential burden that everybody bears and it is associated integrally with suffering</p>
<p t="5575580" d="5380">and so then you think, well life is suffering and it&#39;s finite and that is part of the suffering</p>
<p t="5580960" d="3120">that&#39;s part of what makes you question the value of</p>
<p t="5584800" d="3280">existing and maybe the value of existance itself</p>
<p t="5589620" d="3520">So then what do you have to use as a weapon against that</p>
<p t="5593140" d="5000">Well, you know we talked a little bit about responsibility, that seems to work, you know</p>
<p t="5601760" d="2960">The amount of responsibility that you adopt</p>
<p t="5606380" d="3760">in relationship to things seems to</p>
<p t="5610760" d="8840">increase your meaningful engagement, and you might say, well what&#39;s the most meaningfully engaged activity, and you might say, well</p>
<p t="5621080" d="3020">How about a little reduction in the old suffering?</p>
<p t="5624460" d="2340">You know, so you live your life so that</p>
<p t="5627540" d="4220">you are not causing undue pain, especially pointless pain</p>
<p t="5631760" d="6160">that would be good, and maybe you could even be more useful than that and you could figure out some ways that some suffering</p>
<p t="5638260" d="3600">yours, other peoples, both if you are really</p>
<p t="5643040" d="7000">hitting a home run, maybe you can figure out some way that some of that could be rectified, and that seems to be</p>
<p t="5650060" d="7000">meaningful in and of itself, I mean if it&#39;s pain that makes you doubt the meaning of life, which is perfectly reasonable</p>
<p t="5658640" d="3040">then this cessation of pain</p>
<p t="5661980" d="4000">the cessation of suffering, the minimization of suffering</p>
<p t="5666420" d="4420">as a logical corollary should be the proper medication</p>
<p t="5671280" d="2340">and so I would say that means that</p>
<p t="5674140" d="1640">there is some mode</p>
<p t="5676540" d="5240">that you can conduct yourself in that makes you a good person</p>
<p t="5682320" d="700">and,</p>
<p t="5684080" d="1920">part of being a good person is</p>
<p t="5687360" d="1600">to alleviate suffering</p>
<p t="5689640" d="620">and</p>
<p t="5691740" d="3520">I don&#39;t get think you get to question that actually if</p>
<p t="5695260" d="4480">if the suffering itself is what is making you question the validity of your life then</p>
<p t="5699880" d="4700">you can&#39;t also say that the cessation of that is not useful</p>
<p t="5704580" d="5520">I mean you can but it&#39;s completely incoherent, you can claim incoherent things if you want</p>
<p t="5715200" d="1720">So then I would say,</p>
<p t="5719380" d="3200">these distilled stories that I am talking about</p>
<p t="5722960" d="3440">the stories that are written, say, by great authors</p>
<p t="5727160" d="2640">I am particularly fond of Dosytoevsky,</p>
<p t="5732120" d="1760">whose works are</p>
<p t="5735460" d="4160">he is head and shoulder above anyone I have ever read in terms of</p>
<p t="5740300" d="5940">writers of fiction, he deals with the hardest questions that human beings face</p>
<p t="5746560" d="500">and,</p>
<p t="5747880" d="740">he,</p>
<p t="5748780" d="5640">he has characters on both sides of the argument, and they&#39;re, they really lay out the arguments</p>
<p t="5754540" d="2720">it&#39;s not like Dostoevsky, has a belief so</p>
<p t="5757260" d="5000">he has a character and that character has his beliefs and that character always wins the arguments</p>
<p t="5762260" d="2560">that doesn&#39;t happen is a Dostoevsky novel at all</p>
<p t="5764820" d="3720">he sets up a character and then he sets up 3 or 4 antagonists</p>
<p t="5768540" d="3800">and those antagonists they are not straw men, they&#39;re like iron giants</p>
<p t="5772440" d="6100">they just stomp his protagonist, and the whole thing is a war between these</p>
<p t="5778540" d="4680">different conceptions of being, it&#39;s amazing to see, it&#39;s amazing to read.</p>
<p t="5790500" d="4880">so you distill these stories, great authors distill stories</p>
<p t="5795380" d="2280">great storytellers distill stories</p>
<p t="5797660" d="3520">and we have stories that are very, very, very old</p>
<p t="5801540" d="3700">those are usually religious stories of one form or another, but they can be fairy tales</p>
<p t="5805240" d="5340">because fairy tales, some people have traced fairy tales back more than 10,000 years</p>
<p t="5810580" d="2340">and so they are a part of an oral tradition</p>
<p t="5813060" d="4440">and, oral traditions can last for tens of thousands of years and</p>
<p t="5817500" d="6700">You know, a story that has been told for 10,000 years is a funny kind of story, it&#39;s like, people have remembered it</p>
<p t="5824320" d="7960">and, obviously modified it, it&#39;s like the game of telephone where I tell you something and you whisper it to the person next to you and so on</p>
<p t="5832520" d="5960">It&#39;s like a game of telephone that has gone on for a thousand generations and</p>
<p t="5838480" d="6500">all that&#39;s left is what people remember and maybe they remember what is important, because you tend to remember what is important</p>
<p t="5844980" d="4940">It isn&#39;t necessarily the case you know what the hell it means, you don&#39;t know what music means</p>
<p t="5850640" d="1060">but you know</p>
<p t="5851700" d="2420">it doesn&#39;t stop you from listening to it</p>
<p t="5854120" d="5120">You don&#39;t know generally speaking what a movie that you see or a book that you read means</p>
<p t="5859240" d="4160">not if it is profound, it means more than you can understand</p>
<p t="5863400" d="1360">because otherwise, why read it</p>
<p t="5866840" d="2300">Well, so the idea is this, that</p>
<p t="5870840" d="5680">we are necessarily nested inside moral systems, the moral systems are predicated on</p>
<p t="5877020" d="2640">narratives, narrative dramas of sorts</p>
<p t="5880080" d="720">and,</p>
<p t="5881700" d="2960">the moral systems are what orients us in life</p>
<p t="5884660" d="3340">and the reason to understand them, to the degree that you can</p>
<p t="5888180" d="2480">is because you need to know how to live</p>
<p t="5891940" d="6540">Nietzsche said that if you had a why, you could bear any how.</p>
<p t="5898860" d="620">and</p>
<p t="5899480" d="4720">that&#39;s good, one of the things that the Auschwitz guards used to do to the prisoners</p>
<p t="5904440" d="4400">and this is very telling, so at Auschwitz there was a sign that said</p>
<p t="5908840" d="2080">&quot;Work will make you free&quot;</p>
<p t="5911200" d="1280">it was a little joke</p>
<p t="5913280" d="2360">not really a very funny joke</p>
<p t="5917660" d="2560">It&#39;s the kind of joke that you have to be</p>
<p t="5922000" d="4720">satanic, is the appropriate term, to conceptualize</p>
<p t="5926980" d="1580">and to dare to</p>
<p t="5930160" d="1320">to state</p>
<p t="5932220" d="5120">so when the Auschwitz prisoners came to Auschwitz, they were already pretty</p>
<p t="5937340" d="2320">pretty rough shape, they were in cattle cars</p>
<p t="5939660" d="3420">they had been separated from their families, everything had been taken from them</p>
<p t="5943080" d="2840">they were transported for a long time, they were standing up</p>
<p t="5945920" d="3900">the kids suffocating because there was no room, it was so packed in there</p>
<p t="5949820" d="4580">they didn&#39;t have anything to eat, there weren&#39;t any toilet facilities of any sorts, it was like</p>
<p t="5955080" d="7560">You got rid of 20% of the people just transporting them, the one on the outside of the cars they froze to death because of course it was cold</p>
<p t="5962640" d="600">and</p>
<p t="5963700" d="1060">pretty nasty</p>
<p t="5964940" d="5520">and when they got to Auschwitz, the guards use to have this game that they would play</p>
<p t="5970460" d="3020">this is part of the work will set you free thing</p>
<p t="5974060" d="2800">They would get a prisoner, take a prisoner</p>
<p t="5977380" d="3360">who is already in pretty rough shape</p>
<p t="5980760" d="3600">and then have them carry a sack of wet salt, a 100 pounds</p>
<p t="5984360" d="1440">from one side of the camp</p>
<p t="5986280" d="660">to the other</p>
<p t="5986940" d="6660">and, when you think of a camp you think of something like a football field, maybe something that big, fences around it, like no way man</p>
<p t="5993600" d="4120">these were cities, there were tens of thousands of people in these places</p>
<p t="5997720" d="3860">so from one side of the camp compound to the other, that was a good hike</p>
<p t="6001580" d="5520">and that wasn&#39;t bad enough, they had to get them to , carry it back and put it the same place</p>
<p t="6008880" d="740">Now,</p>
<p t="6013360" d="9880">that&#39;s poetic in it&#39;s malevolence, you know what you are doing is you&#39;re harnessing the human</p>
<p t="6024200" d="3920">compulsion to engage in useful activity</p>
<p t="6028320" d="7200">and demonstrating how absolutely futile that is despite it&#39;s difficulty</p>
<p t="6039460" d="1760">seems like a bad thing to do</p>
<p t="6045500" d="1360">people need</p>
<p t="6047620" d="2900">it&#39;s a parody of meaninglessness, that&#39;s what that is</p>
<p t="6050940" d="4020">and you know, people need meaning in their lives because their lives are difficult</p>
<p t="6055100" d="2460">and so , the question is</p>
<p t="6057560" d="2440">to what end should you devote your life</p>
<p t="6060700" d="2960">and another question might be does it matter</p>
<p t="6064060" d="6380">matter is an interesting word, because matter is matter, but matter is also what matters</p>
<p t="6071680" d="4080">and I would say that what matters is more than real than matter</p>
<p t="6075760" d="5740">at least that&#39;s how you act, and then the question is, well, is there something that you should be aiming at</p>
<p t="6082380" d="4240">It&#39;s a good question, that&#39;s the question of the meaning of life</p>
<p t="6086620" d="4960">and when one of the things that is supposed to happen when you come to university</p>
<p t="6091580" d="2800">is that the sort of question that should be addressed</p>
<p t="6094440" d="1440">and as far as I can tell</p>
<p t="6096520" d="7000">and this just might be my more cynical side, what I see happening to university students, generally speaking is that they come in</p>
<p t="6104040" d="2800">clinging to the wreckage of their culture</p>
<p t="6107600" d="500">and,</p>
<p t="6108680" d="2600">floating, with the pieces and,</p>
<p t="6112680" d="2500">those pieces are taken away by</p>
<p t="6116920" d="1680">professors who tell them that</p>
<p t="6119600" d="5560">everything can be deconstructed and no, nothing has any real meaning, it&#39;s like</p>
<p t="6125160" d="4320">when you are finally educated it&#39;s when floating out on the ocean and you&#39;ve got nothing to</p>
<p t="6129480" d="3740">stay afloat with, then, you are done and you can graduate, and it&#39;s like</p>
<p t="6137540" d="2360">I don&#39;t see that as useful</p>
<p t="6141100" d="1440">quite the contrary</p>
<p t="6151020" d="1680">So let me tell you a story</p>
<p t="6158380" d="5360">The first thing I am going to propose to you, and we are going to talk a lot, is that,</p>
<p t="6163800" d="2640">you inhabit a story, that the framework</p>
<p t="6166440" d="4120">through which you look at the world is actually a story, and here is the story</p>
<p t="6171400" d="2000">The story is you are somewhere</p>
<p t="6173400" d="1700">and you are going somewhere</p>
<p t="6175100" d="2540">and that can be conceptual or whatever, it&#39;s that</p>
<p t="6177640" d="3660">there is a gradient between where you are and where you are aiming at, which means</p>
<p t="6181300" d="3400">no more really than you are doing something while you are sitting there</p>
<p t="6184720" d="3760">and hypothetically you are aiming for something better</p>
<p t="6188480" d="2800">and so, you are in a state of insufficiency</p>
<p t="6191600" d="820">always</p>
<p t="6193360" d="1740">the insufficiencies change</p>
<p t="6195100" d="3420">and then you are trying to rectify the insufficiency and</p>
<p t="6198520" d="4020">and you presume that your current state is less preferable to the state that you are aiming at</p>
<p t="6203180" d="2500">and then, the way that you</p>
<p t="6206200" d="3880">bring those two together is, sometimes you can do that through thinking</p>
<p t="6210080" d="2520">but fundamentally you do it through action</p>
<p t="6212600" d="2560">you do it through acting in the world and so that&#39;s sort of</p>
<p t="6215160" d="3840">that&#39;s sort of the answer in some sense to the mind body problem</p>
<p t="6219000" d="4600">you have a conceptual structure, but when you implement it, you&#39;re implementing,</p>
<p t="6223600" d="3660">it not abstractly, you are implementing through action, so</p>
<p t="6227520" d="3840">that&#39;s the basic story, it&#39;s not a very interesting story</p>
<p t="6231360" d="5020">but it&#39;s the framework through which you view the world, so it&#39;s a value laden framework</p>
<p t="6236380" d="2920">Otherwise you wouldn&#39;t be able to act and you wouldn&#39;t know what to look at</p>
<p t="6239540" d="2280">so, it&#39;s a value laden framework</p>
<p t="6241820" d="5520">you look at the world through a value laden framework so then we might say so what if the optimal value laden framework</p>
<p t="6247340" d="2640">That&#39;s what we are going to try and figure out.</p>
<p t="6251200" d="4100">now, I told you about the war that went on between</p>
<p t="6255800" d="4100">the Communists and the West and how that obsessed me and</p>
<p t="6260200" d="1880">so one of the things that</p>
<p t="6262080" d="3780">I really wondered about was, well was this just an arbitrary thing</p>
<p t="6265860" d="3280">You know, like, did the Communists, they had some axioms, and we had some axioms</p>
<p t="6269140" d="2740">so if you are a moral relativist you might say, well</p>
<p t="6271880" d="2680">whose to say which set of axioms are better,</p>
<p t="6274600" d="5840">or even, whose to claim that you could say that a set of axioms, one set is better than another</p>
<p t="6281320" d="3840">That&#39;s a moral relativist claim and you know fair enough!</p>
<p t="6289500" d="6000">So I thought that maybe this is just an arbitrary thing and it is going to be settled by force</p>
<p t="6295500" d="4020">Because that is how you settle an arbitrary claim between two competing systems</p>
<p t="6299520" d="2100">where there is no room for negotiation</p>
<p t="6301620" d="3120">So I thought about that for a long time, I wanted to know</p>
<p t="6304740" d="5740">what the roots were of the Marxist system and what the roots were of the Western system, and</p>
<p t="6310680" d="5880">what I surmised was that the Western system was actually something that evolved</p>
<p t="6317040" d="5280">whereas the Communist system was a rationalist construction that was imposed</p>
<p t="6322320" d="3620">and they weren&#39;t the same thing, and so then I wondered, well</p>
<p t="6325940" d="6160">what&#39;s Western culture grounded in and is there any reason to assume that that&#39;s real in any sense</p>
<p t="6332600" d="660">and so,</p>
<p t="6334340" d="4560">that&#39;s what took me into the study of the underlying stories</p>
<p t="6338900" d="4920">fundemental stories upon which our culture, I believe, is based and some of those are very old</p>
<p t="6343820" d="5760">I am going to tell you a Mesopotamian story, it&#39;s one of the oldest stories we know, I am going to tell you and Egyptian story</p>
<p t="6350580" d="2160">Those are sources of our culture,</p>
<p t="6352740" d="4080">and I think that those stories are grounded in much older traditions</p>
<p t="6356820" d="2440">and I think that they refer to something real</p>
<p t="6359680" d="2000">actually real, now</p>
<p t="6362360" d="1600">I already told you that,</p>
<p t="6364940" d="3360">there are different ways of conceptualizing real</p>
<p t="6368980" d="5320">and that, my initial hypothesis, presumption, axiom you might say is that</p>
<p t="6375140" d="5520">pain is the most real, and the reason I believe that is  because that is how people act</p>
<p t="6381320" d="1840">Now, you can criticize that</p>
<p t="6383160" d="5240">You can certainly come up with an alternate conceptual framework which the scientists have</p>
<p t="6388400" d="2340">because they believe that the most real thing is matter</p>
<p t="6392960" d="3620">maybe we need more than one set of tools to operate in the world</p>
<p t="6397060" d="1480">it&#39;s possible</p>
<p t="6404540" d="3600">So now I want to tell you what I think is the fundamental</p>
<p t="6408660" d="2320">constituent elements are of</p>
<p t="6411640" d="1160">stories</p>
<p t="6414100" d="2640">and, one of the things that I hope is that</p>
<p t="6417720" d="3440">this, knowing this will make you</p>
<p t="6421560" d="3120">immunize you against ideology</p>
<p t="6424980" d="4720">and the reason I&#39;m, because I believe that ideologies are fragmentary</p>
<p t="6429820" d="3760">meta-narratives and they have their power because</p>
<p t="6433580" d="3320">they&#39;re grounded in the meta-narrative but they only tell part of the story</p>
<p t="6436900" d="3380">but they have power, because they are grounded in the fundemental narrative</p>
<p t="6440560" d="4560">and so, here is the fundamental narrative, the characters let&#39;s say</p>
<p t="6445420" d="1520">we are going to say that</p>
<p t="6447660" d="4480">people are prone to characterize the world, we are social primates</p>
<p t="6452140" d="5300">we are social cognitive primates and we tend to see the world through the lens of a social creature</p>
<p t="6457440" d="5720">and so, and partly because we&#39;re concerned with acting in the world and the world the world is mostly other people</p>
<p t="6463160" d="2560">then we conceptualize the ground of that</p>
<p t="6466400" d="3480">structure for action in characterological terms</p>
<p t="6473960" d="4940">so the, the must fundamental reality is, chaos</p>
<p t="6479600" d="3620">and chaos is what you don&#39;t understand at all</p>
<p t="6483760" d="2420">You can&#39;t even conceptualize it</p>
<p t="6486900" d="2280">you come into contact with it</p>
<p t="6489540" d="1200">in bits and pieces</p>
<p t="6491580" d="3120">when the towers fell, when the Twin Towers fell</p>
<p t="6494800" d="3760">chaos reigned for a few days, everyone was shell shocked</p>
<p t="6499400" d="3840">and that was chaos, and, chaos is what you experience when</p>
<p t="6503880" d="1520">your story falls apart</p>
<p t="6505840" d="2720">and that is a descent into the underworld</p>
<p t="6508560" d="5740">that&#39;s chaos, and basically you live in order and chaos, and order is where, when you do</p>
<p t="6514300" d="3820">what you think you should do, what you want to have have  happen, happens</p>
<p t="6518120" d="2560">that is order, that is explored territory</p>
<p t="6520820" d="3360">and chaos is when, you do what you are supposed to do</p>
<p t="6524300" d="2720">to get what you want and it doesn&#39;t happen</p>
<p t="6527020" d="3900">and then that place that you are magically in when that happens, that&#39;s chaos</p>
<p t="6530920" d="2580">and it has different depths, you could say</p>
<p t="6533500" d="3580">it reaches all the way to Hell and that usually happens when</p>
<p t="6537240" d="2520">your life falls apart very badly</p>
<p t="6539760" d="3720">and you are down in that chaos and you realize that it was your fault</p>
<p t="6543780" d="2160">and that you did something wrong</p>
<p t="6545940" d="2300">and that you knew it, and you ignored it</p>
<p t="6549320" d="2000">That&#39;s the worst form of chaos</p>
<p t="6553820" d="2160">So there is chaos itself and then</p>
<p t="6555980" d="4140">then the next thing is fairly straightforward, you could think</p>
<p t="6560360" d="1600">there is the individual</p>
<p t="6562020" d="2240">the individual exists in culture</p>
<p t="6564260" d="1780">and culture is embedded in nature</p>
<p t="6566040" d="4940">pretty straightforward, nature is Mother Nature for reasons we will get into</p>
<p t="6570980" d="1500">and culture is &quot;Father Culture&quot;</p>
<p t="6572480" d="4040">and I think that&#39;s because the fundamental dominance hierarchies</p>
<p t="6576640" d="2840">in human primates are masculine</p>
<p t="6579700" d="3840">and that Nature is assimilated to the feminine because it&#39;s</p>
<p t="6583540" d="4740">well for two reasons, first of all females do the sexual selection among human beings</p>
<p t="6588280" d="2800">so that they are actually are nature from the Darwinian perspective</p>
<p t="6591080" d="4960">and second, nature is the productive biological force</p>
<p t="6596040" d="5320">and so we have always conceptualized males and females and we used that conceptualization</p>
<p t="6601360" d="1940">to sort out the world</p>
<p t="6604700" d="1060">at large</p>
<p t="6606340" d="1040">it&#39;s a metaphor</p>
<p t="6608000" d="3840">but it&#39;s not just a metaphor, it&#39;s reasonable to consider</p>
<p t="6611840" d="4300">culture as a judgmental father, it&#39;s really reasonable because</p>
<p t="6616200" d="560">you know</p>
<p t="6617900" d="6320">you have a group of people around you, some friends some people that watch you work, some judges</p>
<p t="6624220" d="3780">and that stretches across a very long expanse of time , and</p>
<p t="6628600" d="4080">those people as an aggregate, make an entity that</p>
<p t="6632680" d="2440">is judging your reputation constantly</p>
<p t="6635360" d="3840">and it is perfectly reasonable to personify that because</p>
<p t="6639200" d="2660">it&#39;s like a metaperson that is watching you</p>
<p t="6642380" d="960">and so,</p>
<p t="6643340" d="4240">it&#39;s a useful metaphor, there is a metaperson that is watching you</p>
<p t="6647640" d="2080">Well, yeah there is, obviously</p>
<p t="6650280" d="2800">so, now, you could say well that&#39;s not real, it&#39;s like,</p>
<p t="6656240" d="5120">it&#39;s not real the way a scientific truth is real, it is a different kind of real</p>
<p t="6665200" d="4560">Well nature has two elements, destructive and creative, obviously</p>
<p t="6669860" d="3120">there is the beauty of nature in it&#39;s bountiful</p>
<p t="6673020" d="1440">element and there is</p>
<p t="6675760" d="4660">Anopheles mosquitoes and elephantiasis and cancer and</p>
<p t="6680780" d="3440">starvation and all the terrible elements of nature</p>
<p t="6684220" d="4160">and then there is culture, and culture is tyrannical, because</p>
<p t="6688380" d="5440">you have to shape yourself, involuntarily even to get along with other people, you sacrifice</p>
<p t="6693820" d="3800">a lot of yourself, and develop yourself, but you sacrifice a lot of yourself</p>
<p t="6697620" d="4920">in that endeavor, right we have to kind of average ourselves out in order to</p>
<p t="6702540" d="4620">to live together, and some societies are more tyrannical that others</p>
<p t="6707160" d="4480">but there is always a tyrannical element, you see that in university, you know, you guys know,</p>
<p t="6711640" d="1900">that to some degree, this is such a big place</p>
<p t="6713540" d="4520">it&#39;s easy to feel like a number here, and that, whether you are here or not doesn&#39;t matter</p>
<p t="6718060" d="4240">the institution doesn&#39;t care, well that&#39;s the tyrannical element of it</p>
<p t="6722300" d="3500">now it does care, because here you are and you are getting educated and all that</p>
<p t="6725800" d="1660">and so maybe that&#39;s positive</p>
<p t="6728020" d="4920">but it&#39;s got both, these characters always have two sides</p>
<p t="6733280" d="4240">you know, there&#39;s negative side and the positive side of nature</p>
<p t="6737520" d="4880">and there is the negative side and the positive side of culture and then there is the individual</p>
<p t="6742400" d="4120">so the individual is like standing on an island in the midst of an ocean</p>
<p t="6746880" d="1060">that&#39;s a good</p>
<p t="6749720" d="3120">imagistic conceptualization of your position</p>
<p t="6752840" d="6360">there is solid ground, it has a limited expanse and outside of that is everything you don&#39;t understand</p>
<p t="6759200" d="4180">and you as an individual have a positive and a negative element as well</p>
<p t="6763380" d="2160">and that&#39;s the hero and the villain</p>
<p t="6765540" d="2840">and of course what good is a story without a hero and a villain</p>
<p t="6768380" d="6460">and the villain is the person who isn&#39;t acting like a person should act and the hero is acting like a person should act</p>
<p t="6774840" d="4300">and so when you go to movies and you read books and there are heroes and there is villians</p>
<p t="6779140" d="4280">and to some degree what you are doing is fleshing out your notion of a villain</p>
<p t="6783420" d="4320">you know you read about 30 villains and you think well there is something villainous about the villains</p>
<p t="6787900" d="2640">that is the central element of villainy</p>
<p t="6790620" d="1300">whatever that is</p>
<p t="6792340" d="3520">and, you can imagine you construct out a metavillain</p>
<p t="6795940" d="4400">and a metahero, and those are the characters in</p>
<p t="6801020" d="3200">religious stories, generally speaking</p>
<p t="6804620" d="3600">you know, and in the Marvel movies</p>
<p t="6809140" d="3100">there is Odin, and Odin has two sons</p>
<p t="6812520" d="2800">right, Thor and Loki, and Thor is like</p>
<p t="6821040" d="6480">Thor is the world redeeming hero and Loki is the trickster who wants to bring everything down, and</p>
<p t="6828320" d="2560">you have to recognize that in yourself</p>
<p t="6830880" d="3640">or it&#39;s useful to because otherwise you underestimate</p>
<p t="6834640" d="2940">[student entering] Is this positive psyche?</p>
<p t="6837660" d="3760">No, it&#39;s Maps of Meaning</p>
<p t="6843320" d="6240">Positive psyche...[laughter]</p>
<p t="6849700" d="3680">It&#39;s definitely not that...[laughter]</p>
<p t="6857660" d="1920">Why might you be villainous?</p>
<p t="6861740" d="2400">Well first of all because you can be,</p>
<p t="6864160" d="1540">that &#39;s a big deal</p>
<p t="6866100" d="3200">you can be, it&#39;s actually an offshoot of empathy</p>
<p t="6869560" d="3440">this is something that took me decades to figure out</p>
<p t="6873000" d="3520">I figured it out when I was studying the book of Genesis</p>
<p t="6876520" d="1420">because in the book of Genesis</p>
<p t="6877940" d="4500">people become self conscious, and they immediately have the knowledge of good and evil</p>
<p t="6882440" d="4560">I just couldn&#39;t figure that out, it&#39;s like what the hell is the relationship between that</p>
<p t="6887000" d="3580">and then really, I tell you I thought about that for like 30 years</p>
<p t="6890580" d="3460">trying to puzzle that out, and then I realized what it was</p>
<p t="6895180" d="1680">If you are self conscious</p>
<p t="6898420" d="2800">you can conceptualize yourself as a being</p>
<p t="6901560" d="1800">you know that you are</p>
<p t="6903900" d="1920">and you know what you&#39;re like</p>
<p t="6905880" d="2880">and you know what hurts you and what doesn&#39;t</p>
<p t="6909980" d="2240">and soon as you know what hurts you</p>
<p t="6913120" d="1800">you know what hurts her</p>
<p t="6915780" d="3960">and so that is the knowledge of good and evil that comes along with being self conscious</p>
<p t="6919740" d="3220">this is something that distinguishes human beings from every other animal</p>
<p t="6923240" d="1840">you know, a lion will eat you</p>
<p t="6925240" d="3360">but it doesn&#39;t really want to tear you apart slowly</p>
<p t="6928680" d="1360">just for the fun of it</p>
<p t="6930040" d="2660">well, it eats you, it just wants to eat you</p>
<p t="6932700" d="3180">you know, you could call that evil, it sucks that for sure</p>
<p t="6936160" d="4560">but, animals are beyond good and evil in that sense, but human beings, man</p>
<p t="6940720" d="2540">we can aim our malevolence and we are really good at it</p>
<p t="6943260" d="5180">because we can imagine, God this would hurt, and if it hurts me, man, it&#39;s really going to hurt you</p>
<p t="6948440" d="3920">so, and you need to know that you are like that, because you are like that</p>
<p t="6952360" d="3000">and it you don&#39;t know that you are like that, or if you don&#39;t think that you are like that</p>
<p t="6955380" d="2860">you are more even like that than you think</p>
<p t="6958240" d="4640">because the people who are most like that are people who don&#39;t think that they are like that at all</p>
<p t="6963600" d="2160">and you have to contend with that</p>
<p t="6965760" d="6160">and that&#39;s why in many systems of thinking the world is conceptualized as a battle between good and evil</p>
<p t="6972000" d="2960">and it&#39;s an appropriate conceptualization</p>
<p t="6976280" d="2480">it&#39;s a meta-conceptualization, and</p>
<p t="6978820" d="4560">the culture is the wise king and the tyrant and that&#39;s always the case</p>
<p t="6983380" d="5180">and you are always stuck with that because as an individual, with your negative and your positive side</p>
<p t="6988560" d="2860">your negative side is the resentful side that is</p>
<p t="6992000" d="3120">irritated and the limited conditions of being</p>
<p t="6995120" d="4180">and the suffering that entails and it&#39;s arbitrary and unfair nature</p>
<p t="6999320" d="4120">and no wonder, like, you got, that side has a case to make</p>
<p t="7003700" d="1760">and it is not trivial</p>
<p t="7006820" d="3520">In the Brothers Karamazov, that argument is laid out</p>
<p t="7010340" d="6400">beautifully, there is a character, Alyosha, who is a monastery novitiate and not really a sparkling intellect</p>
<p t="7016900" d="7840">but a very good person, and he has a brother Ivan, and Ivan is, a vicious genius</p>
<p t="7027620" d="4980">and Ivan just takes Alyosha apart, and partly does that by telling a story about</p>
<p t="7032840" d="3380">Dostoyevsky took this from a news story</p>
<p t="7036220" d="4540">the news story was that this mother and father had taken their young daughter and</p>
<p t="7040760" d="2200">locked her in the outhouse overnight</p>
<p t="7042960" d="5280">when it was 30 below, and she stayed out there crying and screaming and froze to death</p>
<p t="7048780" d="3500">and Ivan basically said to Alyosha, you know,</p>
<p t="7055360" d="3120">A world in which that could happen should not be</p>
<p t="7060920" d="5280">It&#39;s a good argument, you know and you can multiply that by millions of examples</p>
<p t="7068080" d="3600">so the part of us that is opposed to being and resentful</p>
<p t="7072860" d="1360">it&#39;s got a point man,</p>
<p t="7075080" d="4780">the problem as far as I can tell is that, if you act that out</p>
<p t="7079980" d="2960">then it makes what you are objecting to worse</p>
<p t="7083840" d="2400">now you might be happy about that and</p>
<p t="7086240" d="2660">you might think, well people couldn&#39;t be consciously</p>
<p t="7089180" d="2740">pursuing that, but, yes they can</p>
<p t="7091920" d="4460">I would recommend a book called Panzram if you are interested in that sort of thing</p>
<p t="7096780" d="4500">it&#39;s a book written by a man who raped 1200 men and killed dozens</p>
<p t="7101280" d="2980">and burned things down to the ground every chance that he got</p>
<p t="7104260" d="2820">and tried to start a war between England and the U.S. and</p>
<p t="7107300" d="2320">who was aimed at nothing but mayhem</p>
<p t="7109620" d="3520">and he wrote an autobiography at the request of a doctor</p>
<p t="7113140" d="4400">who had befriended him, and he tells you exactly what he did and why</p>
<p t="7125400" d="720">this story</p>
<p t="7128660" d="2640">hero and adversary</p>
<p t="7132900" d="3720">order and tyranny, destruction and creation</p>
<p t="7137800" d="4200">that&#39;s the basic landscape, and outside of that chaos, and so let&#39;s take a break</p>
<p t="7143300" d="1440">Here is another way of</p>
<p t="7145520" d="3220">looking at this, idea</p>
<p t="7152680" d="4440">the individual is the person who pays attention</p>
<p t="7157620" d="3860">and explores, and masters, or who looks away</p>
<p t="7164200" d="680">and the</p>
<p t="7166000" d="3120">the person who inhabits an explored territory</p>
<p t="7170380" d="2240">and this is unexplored territory</p>
<p t="7173700" d="5460">and so, wherever you go there is you and the half, the two halves of you</p>
<p t="7179420" d="2680">that you have to contend with, and</p>
<p t="7183260" d="6240">wherever you are with people there is the society with it&#39;s tyrannical and beneficial nature</p>
<p t="7189740" d="6000">and the society in some sense is that match between what you are doing and what&#39;s happening</p>
<p t="7195740" d="4260">it&#39;s really important to get that right, and unexplored territory, that where ever</p>
<p t="7200480" d="3660">and whenever, what you are doing stops working</p>
<p t="7204140" d="6440">and so, it&#39;s not exactly a geographical idea, you know, because when you think of explored territory</p>
<p t="7210580" d="4660">you think of geographic landscape, like the domain of an animal, like your house</p>
<p t="7215380" d="1760">and, you know, that&#39;s</p>
<p t="7221240" d="3360">that&#39;s definitely and element of it , but you know,</p>
<p t="7224600" d="4640">if you&#39;re in your house and a snake comes into your living room and you are in there it&#39;s like, well</p>
<p t="7229240" d="4760">that&#39;s an important difference between your house 1 second ago and your house now</p>
<p t="7234400" d="7000">and so your house can turn into unexplored territory at the drop of a hat, and that is because we live in space and time</p>
<p t="7241400" d="4380">and so the unexplored territory is conceptual, it&#39;s a conceptual</p>
<p t="7246140" d="6100">territory and it&#39;s just wherever you are when things aren&#39;t working</p>
<p t="7252340" d="2480">for you the way they are supposed to be</p>
<p t="7255080" d="5220">and so, and these are permanent parts of the human experience</p>
<p t="7260300" d="2820">which is why I think that they are fundamental characters in our narratives</p>
<p t="7263120" d="1260">there is always you,</p>
<p t="7265200" d="2240">there is some subject of the story</p>
<p t="7267440" d="3660">and that subject is an ambivalent person with many different potentials and</p>
<p t="7271100" d="1540">you are always somewhere,</p>
<p t="7272640" d="3400">with other people, because that&#39;s our territory, right, I mean</p>
<p t="7276040" d="2220">we are social beyond comprehension</p>
<p t="7278260" d="4120">and you know even our primate ancestors, most of their territory</p>
<p t="7282820" d="7960">was other primates, and their brains, and our brains, are specialized to view the world as an aggregation of personalities</p>
<p t="7290980" d="4640">It&#39;s really important to us, and so we tend to view the whole world that way</p>
<p t="7296120" d="3040">and, then, unexplored territory, well</p>
<p t="7300080" d="3280">that&#39;s where, you don&#39;t know what to do</p>
<p t="7303360" d="3540">and, but, you know you do know what to do when you don&#39;t know what to do</p>
<p t="7306900" d="6660">peculiarly enough, it&#39;s rather non-specific, it&#39;s this generalized stress response and so what happens is</p>
<p t="7314180" d="4000">you freeze, roughly speaking, if the threat is enough, then</p>
<p t="7318180" d="4140">you produce a lot of cortisol and a lot of adrenaline so that you&#39;re</p>
<p t="7322320" d="3420">bloody well ready to move quick in whatever direction you have to</p>
<p t="7326000" d="2560">and then, maybe you pay more attention</p>
<p t="7328560" d="5980">and that&#39;s what you do when you don&#39;t know what to do, and the problem with that is that you can stay in that state forever, man</p>
<p t="7334540" d="2620">that is kind of what post traumatic stress disorder is, it&#39;s like</p>
<p t="7337360" d="2240">you are just like that all the time</p>
<p t="7339600" d="3520">and the problem with that is, it&#39;s very uncomfortable, I mean</p>
<p t="7343120" d="3300">You stay like that for any length of time you are going to get depressed</p>
<p t="7346420" d="3060">you are going to develop an anxiety disorder, you are going to get old</p>
<p t="7349480" d="3580">because, you&#39;re burning up resources like mad, you know,</p>
<p t="7353400" d="3520">your system is shunting everything to maintain that</p>
<p t="7356920" d="2380">state of emergency preparation and</p>
<p t="7359880" d="1120">it&#39;s exhausting</p>
<p t="7361600" d="1840">it&#39;s not where you want to be</p>
<p t="7364140" d="3280">so, that&#39;s partly why people are so prone to</p>
<p t="7367420" d="3360">defend their territories, their familiar territories because</p>
<p t="7370780" d="3520">if their familiar territory is invaded or disrupted</p>
<p t="7374300" d="4940">then they default back to this state of emergency preparation and that&#39;s like</p>
<p t="7379660" d="3460">that can unglue you, if it&#39;s profound enough</p>
<p t="7383120" d="2080">you know and you guys know this already, I mean</p>
<p t="7385200" d="2940">I think that people experience this most particularly</p>
<p t="7388140" d="3960">when they are betrayed by someone they have an intimate relationship with</p>
<p t="7392100" d="1680">you know, when they are lied to</p>
<p t="7393860" d="1360">there are other ways</p>
<p t="7395220" d="3540">the collapse of a dream or a vision that you&#39;ve been pursuing or</p>
<p t="7398760" d="4520">an illness or the death in a family, there are lots of other ways, but betrayal is a really good one</p>
<p t="7403280" d="3920">because, if you are with someone for a long time, you trust them</p>
<p t="7407200" d="4920">you have a representation of your past, you have a representation of you in the relationship</p>
<p t="7412120" d="3900">you have a representation of them, you have a representation of relationships</p>
<p t="7416020" d="2260">you have a representation of the future</p>
<p t="7418320" d="5120">you get betrayed, it&#39;s like, poof, even the past isn&#39;t what you thought it was</p>
<p t="7423440" d="1520">you know, and what about you</p>
<p t="7426200" d="1780">How clueless are you ?</p>
<p t="7427980" d="4560">and maybe not at all, or ultimately gullible, you don&#39;t know, is it your fault?</p>
<p t="7432660" d="3680">are you so clueless that just can&#39;t protect yourself or</p>
<p t="7436340" d="4100">was the person malevolent in some subtle way that you failed to detect</p>
<p t="7440440" d="1560">everything is up in the air</p>
<p t="7442680" d="4080">not good, and this idea that human beings</p>
<p t="7446760" d="4900">travel to the underworld and come back it&#39;s a really useful thing to understand because</p>
<p t="7452080" d="1640">we do that all the time</p>
<p t="7453720" d="4080">whenever we fail, it&#39;s like, whoop, down into the underworld for a while</p>
<p t="7457820" d="1920">where everything is in chaos</p>
<p t="7459740" d="3340">and then maybe we sort ourselves out and, bang, we are back up</p>
<p t="7463180" d="3360">and so, one way of conceptualizing yourself is not</p>
<p t="7467120" d="3120">as order, and not as chaos</p>
<p t="7470240" d="4120">but as the thing that traverses between the two domains</p>
<p t="7475140" d="2720">and that I would say is mythological hero</p>
<p t="7483560" d="660">so,</p>
<p t="7484220" d="3460">I am going to start talking to you about Pinocchio a little bit</p>
<p t="7488100" d="1040">weirdly enough</p>
<p t="7489740" d="1480">I hope you enjoy this</p>
<p t="7493980" d="3680">and the reason I want to do it is because I want to put some</p>
<p t="7499500" d="2720">I want to bring what I told you abstractly</p>
<p t="7502680" d="880">down to earth</p>
<p t="7503560" d="1720">and then you can start thinking,</p>
<p t="7505280" d="4080">well, do the conceptions that I have introduced to you, are they good for anything</p>
<p t="7509480" d="940">do they help?</p>
<p t="7511480" d="3040">that&#39;s the, order</p>
<p t="7515540" d="3940">descent into chaos, reestablishment of order</p>
<p t="7519640" d="2960">that&#39;s paradise lost, profane history</p>
<p t="7522700" d="2960">paradise regained, it&#39;s the classic comedy</p>
<p t="7525780" d="2000">and that&#39;s the story of life</p>
<p t="7528560" d="740">and so,</p>
<p t="7529320" d="2400">the question is how do you manage it?</p>
<p t="7532400" d="680">and so,</p>
<p t="7533080" d="4320">that&#39;s a question you really want to know the answer to so you will go</p>
<p t="7537520" d="1840">you will pay money, weirdly</p>
<p t="7539360" d="1820">you&#39;ll line up and pay money</p>
<p t="7541340" d="4300">to see a story about that, even if you don&#39;t even know what that stories about</p>
<p t="7545640" d="960">and the reason</p>
<p t="7546600" d="3100">for that actually part of you does know what the story is about</p>
<p t="7549700" d="3600">you know, you have, your cognition has multiple layers</p>
<p t="7553380" d="1800">you understand things</p>
<p t="7556220" d="2640">that you don&#39;t know that you understand</p>
<p t="7558860" d="3920">in ways that you don&#39;t understand, and you can tell that because, you know</p>
<p t="7562780" d="3640">we talked about Pinocchio a little bit, how absurd it is</p>
<p t="7566420" d="2860">and that it doesn&#39;t matter, well</p>
<p t="7570420" d="6060">[Student]  I have a question, so we have been talking, chaos is when people don&#39;t do what they</p>
<p t="7576480" d="3300">expect you to do in a negative sense, something bad happens to you.</p>
<p t="7579800" d="5080">what if the reaction is extremely positive, like something that...like winning the lottery</p>
<p t="7585200" d="3860">Do you also go into the stress response, or?</p>
<p t="7589840" d="1460">So it would be the same thing...</p>
<p t="7591300" d="4060">[JBP] No it&#39;s not quite the same thing, it&#39;s a good question and we will address that</p>
<p t="7595360" d="1000">we will address that</p>
<p t="7596360" d="4020">I mean, winning the lottery is generally not a good idea for people</p>
<p t="7600940" d="2400">you know, because it&#39;s just too much</p>
<p t="7603380" d="1440">it&#39;s too much for them</p>
<p t="7604820" d="1940">flips their lives upside down</p>
<p t="7607340" d="620">so,</p>
<p t="7607960" d="5040">and they tend, at best, to return to their original baseline level of emotion</p>
<p t="7613040" d="3100">but yes, something remarkably good</p>
<p t="7616140" d="4520">I mean, it&#39;s a lot better that something remarkably bad, obviously, but it</p>
<p t="7620700" d="3560">still can have that destabilizing effect</p>
<p t="7624600" d="4000">so, depends on what elements of your life it disrupts</p>
<p t="7629140" d="4360">like, in some sense you have a map that you are operating</p>
<p t="7633540" d="1940">within, in the world</p>
<p t="7635480" d="3860">and that map is predicated on assumptions of different sorts</p>
<p t="7639400" d="2380">some shallow, some profound</p>
<p t="7641980" d="3120">when the profound assumptions are devastated</p>
<p t="7645100" d="2440">huge chunks of the map are invalidated</p>
<p t="7647560" d="1440">and that can happen</p>
<p t="7649060" d="4000">sometimes when dramatically positive things happen as well</p>
<p t="7653220" d="4680">so, but the fundamental rule is, the more of your</p>
<p t="7658420" d="1960">axiomatic presuppositions</p>
<p t="7662080" d="2940">are disrupted, the harder it is on you</p>
<p t="7665020" d="2480">you know, like maybe you quit your job because you won the lottery</p>
<p t="7667500" d="2680">Hey, I am off to the beach, I am going to drink margaritas</p>
<p t="7670180" d="2580">it&#39;s like that will work for about four days</p>
<p t="7672760" d="5160">you know, you do that for three months you are a beach alcoholic, it&#39;s like that&#39;s a real improvement</p>
<p t="7677920" d="4640">you know, so it&#39;s not that easy, often too if you take people out of their routine</p>
<p t="7683100" d="2180">you know, they just flounder</p>
<p t="7686340" d="4200">their circadian rhythms go, they don&#39;t eat properly, they don&#39;t know what the hell to do</p>
<p t="7691200" d="1000">you know, so</p>
<p t="7692880" d="3620">this is often why people have such a hard time when they retire</p>
<p t="7696500" d="1860">I am going to retire and relax, it&#39;s like</p>
<p t="7702180" d="2760">if I relaxed for two weeks I would die</p>
<p t="7704980" d="2220">you know, I need something to do</p>
<p t="7707200" d="1960">I need to be engaged in something</p>
<p t="7709440" d="800">so, OK</p>
<p t="7712140" d="4660">Pinocchio, Disney movie, an early one, a masterpiece</p>
<p t="7716800" d="1960">so I am going to walk you through it</p>
<p t="7718760" d="1900">and I am going to tell you</p>
<p t="7721080" d="1680">what I think it means, and</p>
<p t="7722760" d="2380">and you can tell me if you think that that is useful,</p>
<p t="7725140" d="4260">and I am only going to do that for about ten minutes today because I do want to cover some of the details</p>
<p t="7729420" d="4680">of the class and then next class we will continue with this, so</p>
<p t="7736580" d="2400">So the movie opens, with</p>
<p t="7739060" d="1360">the opening credits</p>
<p t="7740420" d="3740">which are carved wooden signs, which is like a hint you know</p>
<p t="7744600" d="3600">because Geppetto is a carver, and it starts with this song</p>
<p t="7748200" d="2020">which was actually quite a popular song</p>
<p t="7750300" d="1380">and it&#39;s a bit of a</p>
<p t="7752780" d="1200">what would you call it</p>
<p t="7755060" d="1520">I don&#39;t think that it&#39;s,</p>
<p t="7756580" d="2300">the poetry is particularly profound</p>
<p t="7758940" d="4320">but it was a song that people liked and people still listen to, and</p>
<p t="7763880" d="3760">It&#39;s sets the tone for the movie, which is what music does</p>
<p t="7767640" d="3820">one of the things that is really interesting about movies, that&#39;s really mysterious is that</p>
<p t="7772260" d="760">you know,</p>
<p t="7773020" d="3080">if you go to a movie, there is almost always a soundtrack</p>
<p t="7776720" d="2700">right, if you go to movie and there isn&#39;t a soundtrack</p>
<p t="7779420" d="2840">it kind of feels empty, it feels like there is something missing, and</p>
<p t="7782260" d="1700">you know, it&#39;s as if the music</p>
<p t="7783960" d="2500">You know, when you go to a movie there is lots of things you can&#39;t</p>
<p t="7786460" d="2320">see, the characters are only partial, and</p>
<p t="7788780" d="3900">you don&#39;t know anything about there background, so it&#39;s like a low resolution thing</p>
<p t="7792680" d="3900">and what seems to happen with the music is that it&#39;s provides the emotional background</p>
<p t="7796580" d="4820">the complex context, let&#39;s say, it&#39;s like a substitute</p>
<p t="7801600" d="4880">for the context and it guides you in your, in your perceptions of the movie</p>
<p t="7806480" d="2320">it gives you hints about what is going to happen and,</p>
<p t="7808800" d="4560">and, the funny thing about that is that we just don&#39;t have any problem with that</p>
<p t="7813740" d="3920">you know, it&#39;s like , yeah of course a movie has a soundtrack</p>
<p t="7817660" d="3600">and of course when there is a dramatic scene the music gets dramatic and</p>
<p t="7821260" d="1640">but that doesn&#39;t happen in real life</p>
<p t="7822900" d="3060">so you would wonder why we would accept it in a movie, and</p>
<p t="7825980" d="5440">I think it is partly because we are willing to accept the amplification of reality</p>
<p t="7831420" d="1660">that constitutes a movie</p>
<p t="7833080" d="4740">and in fact we find that compelling and music is one of the things that does that amplification</p>
<p t="7837820" d="3760">the dramatization, and that&#39;s, that&#39;s acceptable to us</p>
<p t="7842200" d="4180">This song I find quite interesting so I am going to take it apart quite a bit,</p>
<p t="7850300" d="4720">in some sense I feel foolish doing it because it&#39;s, you know, it&#39;s a childish</p>
<p t="7855400" d="3240">it&#39;s a childish song in some ways</p>
<p t="7858640" d="500">but,</p>
<p t="7860100" d="5040">but that&#39;s OK, &quot;When you wish upon a star, it makes no difference who you are&quot;</p>
<p t="7866000" d="3000">well, OK, there&#39;s some mysteries there</p>
<p t="7871100" d="3840">people wish upon stars, that&#39;s like a little ritual, right</p>
<p t="7877020" d="800">Why,</p>
<p t="7878840" d="1040">do they do that?</p>
<p t="7882460" d="500">well,</p>
<p t="7885600" d="2000">and what is exactly is a star</p>
<p t="7887780" d="2240">that&#39;s another question because</p>
<p t="7890240" d="2720">there are stars that shine in the heavens</p>
<p t="7893020" d="2240">and there are people who are stars</p>
<p t="7896760" d="600">and so,</p>
<p t="7899060" d="1480">Why are people stars?</p>
<p t="7900920" d="3180">Well they are usually famous people, right, they are people that</p>
<p t="7904380" d="2000">who attract a lot of attention</p>
<p t="7906380" d="3300">and maybe they are people who, who have a lot of talent , that&#39;s a possibility</p>
<p t="7910100" d="7000">Maybe they are models, I don&#39;t mean clothing models although sometimes they are, they are models for emulation</p>
<p t="7917100" d="3900">that&#39;s what being a star means, that&#39;s why People magazine is full of stars</p>
<p t="7921220" d="3880">it&#39;s like they&#39;re heroes brought to earth</p>
<p t="7925100" d="4000">and of course you know nothing about them, all you know is their public persona</p>
<p t="7929100" d="3020">and of course they are usually very attractive and so</p>
<p t="7932440" d="5600">that allows you to project upon them all the things that go along with ideal humanity</p>
<p t="7939040" d="1360">and so they are stars</p>
<p t="7941440" d="4420">and, but still, why stars? well stars beckon in the darkness, right?</p>
<p t="7946080" d="1760">and they are other worldly</p>
<p t="7947860" d="3680">that&#39;s the thing that&#39;s cool, they are not of this earth</p>
<p t="7951800" d="1240">and I mean that</p>
<p t="7953040" d="4840">technically, because obviously they are not of this earth, but I also mean it</p>
<p t="7957920" d="840">I mean it,</p>
<p t="7958760" d="4200">phenomenologically, I mean it as an element of human experiance, so</p>
<p t="7963840" d="1360">most of you are urban</p>
<p t="7966260" d="3060">and so, you have not had the experience of</p>
<p t="7969320" d="4380">perhaps of the full night sky, and you know that is really to bad because</p>
<p t="7974080" d="4800">the full night sky is one of those experiences that actually induces awe</p>
<p t="7979160" d="2320">naturally, you know, and no wonder</p>
<p t="7981480" d="3080">you look up there and there are just stars everywhere</p>
<p t="7984560" d="2880">right, you are looking at the edge of the galaxy, that&#39;s actually</p>
<p t="7987440" d="3300">that&#39;s the Milky Way, right, it&#39;s the edge of the galaxy, it&#39;s like wrah!</p>
<p t="7991000" d="2320">Wow! There is the edge of the galaxy</p>
<p t="7993320" d="5080">and there is just so many of them, and it&#39;s such an expanse, you are looking into infinity</p>
<p t="7998400" d="3860">you are looking into the unknown, you are looking beyond yourself</p>
<p t="8002300" d="1040">that&#39;s for sure</p>
<p t="8003340" d="5580">and, you know, that produces a sense of awe in people, like looking at the Grand Canyon or something like that</p>
<p t="8008920" d="5740">and, it&#39;s, you are looking at something that transcends yourself, but that feeling of awe, that seems to be something that&#39;s</p>
<p t="8015300" d="3440">that&#39;s a natural part of our response</p>
<p t="8018740" d="5580">and, you know, you might feel awe when you meet someone that you regard as particularly admirable as well</p>
<p t="8024320" d="2420">because you feel that there is something transcendent about them</p>
<p t="8026740" d="2320">Here is an interesting thing to think about</p>
<p t="8031020" d="1840">There are people you admire</p>
<p t="8033160" d="2480">and there are people you don&#39;t admire</p>
<p t="8035640" d="3580">and that&#39;s a clue right, that&#39;s a clue as to your value system, and</p>
<p t="8039220" d="6020">it might be not something that you can really put your finger on, it&#39;s like, you find this person captivating, you find this person</p>
<p t="8045280" d="1240">admirable</p>
<p t="8046520" d="4100">and it&#39;s as if there is something inside of you that is looking for what is admirable</p>
<p t="8050620" d="1660">you know, assuming that you are</p>
<p t="8052400" d="4320">and that person who is admirable has a faculty, some faculty</p>
<p t="8056720" d="2200">that you would like to have for yourself</p>
<p t="8058920" d="2260">and so they are a model for emulation</p>
<p t="8061180" d="4880">and that&#39;s part of how people develop, you know, like little kids often develop little hero</p>
<p t="8066080" d="2080">crushes on older kids</p>
<p t="8068160" d="4640">you know, not that much older but sort of the person that is just within their grasp</p>
<p t="8072800" d="2180">and then they follow them around and imitate them and</p>
<p t="8075220" d="3660">So they are imitating what they find admirable, well</p>
<p t="8078880" d="6520">The fact that you find something admirable is a hint as to the structure of your unconscious value system</p>
<p t="8085860" d="4400">and so, you could think even as an exercise, you could think</p>
<p t="8090260" d="4980">what qualities of a human being do I find admirable, you have to ask yourself that, in a sense,</p>
<p t="8095240" d="6180">you can&#39;t really think about it, there is a difference between asking yourself a question and thinking about it</p>
<p t="8101420" d="5120">You know, because, it&#39;s more like when you are asking yourself a question, it&#39;s contemplative</p>
<p t="8106860" d="2080">Well, what do I find admirable?</p>
<p t="8109080" d="2340">It&#39;s a question, you don&#39;t know, and</p>
<p t="8111420" d="6300">if you are fortunate, and this happens quite regularly, an answer will float up from wherever the hell answers float up</p>
<p t="8117720" d="2600">and, Oh yeah that&#39;s one, and you can write that down</p>
<p t="8120320" d="4780">you get some idea of what your ideal is, you know and, and you have one likely</p>
<p t="8125580" d="2080">and what your counter-ideal is</p>
<p t="8131100" d="840">Star</p>
<p t="8131940" d="3740">Well, to wish upon a star is to raise your eyes above the horizon</p>
<p t="8135740" d="3840">and to focus on something transcendent that is beyond you</p>
<p t="8139580" d="4700">to focus on the absolute we could say, to focus on the light that shines in the darkness</p>
<p t="8144680" d="1060">Now, a star is</p>
<p t="8146180" d="3360">People wear diamonds because they are like stars</p>
<p t="8149540" d="1320">or they are like the sun</p>
<p t="8150860" d="3840">and they are pure and perfect and they glitter, so there is something about the light too</p>
<p t="8154700" d="2580">there is something about a source of light</p>
<p t="8157280" d="2260">It&#39;s a source of illumination and enlightenment</p>
<p t="8159540" d="4800">and the light that shines in the darkness is a deep metaphor, right, it&#39;s</p>
<p t="8164340" d="3700">it&#39;s what you want, you want a light to shine in the darkness</p>
<p t="8168040" d="3860">and so, the star has all of that, and so, people wish upon a star</p>
<p t="8172420" d="4640">because they have some intuition that aiming above the mundane</p>
<p t="8177460" d="4400">has the potential to transform themselves, they make a wish, well</p>
<p t="8183120" d="1200">If you are going to</p>
<p t="8185220" d="3360">make a wish you should aim at something high!</p>
<p t="8188580" d="5240">and even just aiming at that is more likely to make the wish come true, and this is not</p>
<p t="8194820" d="820">metaphor,</p>
<p t="8195640" d="3500">you know I have this program which you guys are going to do</p>
<p t="8199140" d="2300">called the future authoring program</p>
<p t="8201440" d="3400">it&#39;s one of two assignments, one is that you write an autobiography</p>
<p t="8204840" d="2560">that&#39;s the past authoring, the other is that you write</p>
<p t="8207400" d="3520">a plan for the future, that&#39;s the future authoring, I would recommend that you get started</p>
<p t="8210920" d="6200">on those right now, like, not right now, but really soon because, they are harder than you think</p>
<p t="8217360" d="3360">and some of you are going to write like 15,000 words</p>
<p t="8220720" d="4660">you are going to get sucked right in, this happens all the time, you are going to get sucked right into it</p>
<p t="8225880" d="660">and so,</p>
<p t="8226540" d="3520">you write an autobiography because you need to know where you are</p>
<p t="8230060" d="5900">and who you are, right now,  because how the hell are you going to plot a pathway to the future unless you know where you are</p>
<p t="8235960" d="2760">and then you need to write about the future because</p>
<p t="8238720" d="2120">you aren&#39;t going to hit something unless you aim at it</p>
<p t="8242440" d="1040">that&#39;s for sure</p>
<p t="8243480" d="4100">and lot&#39;s of times people won&#39;t aim at what they want because they are afraid</p>
<p t="8247580" d="5440">the reason they are afraid is because if you specify what you want you have specified your conditions of failure</p>
<p t="8253280" d="1440">you know when you fail</p>
<p t="8254720" d="4860">and it is better to just keep foggy, it&#39;s like, well I don&#39;t know if I am succeeding or failing but</p>
<p t="8259580" d="5800">you know, I can&#39;t really tell. Well great! Except you can&#39;t hit anything you don&#39;t aim at</p>
<p t="8265580" d="3440">and so, the future authoring program is like a</p>
<p t="8269020" d="3440">it&#39;s an attempt to have your articulate you character</p>
<p t="8272620" d="3780">and so is the past authoring program.  Who are you?</p>
<p t="8276620" d="4800">and, you know, the past authoring program asks you to break your life into</p>
<p t="8281420" d="5640">epochs and then to write about the emotional, you know the things that you regard as important</p>
<p t="8288020" d="3360">Important events that have shaped who you are, and</p>
<p t="8291380" d="4960">you know, you may find that some of those, some of that writing makes you emotional, and I would say</p>
<p t="8296340" d="3200">if you have a memory that is more than 18 months old, roughly speaking</p>
<p t="8299580" d="3680">and when you bring it to mind, it has an emotional impact</p>
<p t="8303260" d="2120">especially a negative emotional impact</p>
<p t="8305440" d="3260">it&#39;s like part of you soul is stuck back there</p>
<p t="8308700" d="4660">and, I know that that&#39;s a metaphorical way of thinking about, but what I mean is that</p>
<p t="8315040" d="7000">The reason that you still experience the emotion is because you have not solved the problem that that situation</p>
<p t="8322040" d="4960">faced you with, and it might be a real problem like maybe you got tangled up with someone</p>
<p t="8327000" d="4240">who was really bad, and that&#39;s rough, man, because you have got to come up with a theory of malevolence to deal with</p>
<p t="8331240" d="2260">something like that, and that&#39;s no joke</p>
<p t="8333500" d="5120">but, if its still producing emotion, that means you have not solved the problem, and</p>
<p t="8338620" d="5940">your brain is still tagging it as threat, it&#39;s a part of you territory that you did not master</p>
<p t="8344560" d="2160">threat, threat, threat, threat</p>
<p t="8346720" d="5040">and until you take it apart, and articulation really helps that, writing really helps that</p>
<p t="8352100" d="3600">then, you are not going to free yourself from it&#39;s grip</p>
<p t="8355700" d="5220">and that, what might not be that pleasant, I mean this one of those situations where doing it</p>
<p t="8361160" d="2960">tends to produce a decrement in peoples mood</p>
<p t="8364120" d="4920">in the short term, but quite radical improvements 3 to 6 months down the road</p>
<p t="8369040" d="5960">you know it is often the case that you unfortunately have to do something you don&#39;t want to do in order to progress</p>
<p t="8375060" d="2220">it&#39;s very, very common</p>
<p t="8377280" d="5180">so, and the future authoring program asks you about different dimensions of your life</p>
<p t="8382700" d="5440">Like, because you&#39;re, you can think of yourself as a personality inside your head but,</p>
<p t="8388280" d="6400">you are nested in systems that transcend you, and they are just as real as whatever is in your head, its like</p>
<p t="8394840" d="3240">Well, what do you need for life?</p>
<p t="8398220" d="4000">Well, that&#39;s pretty easy actually, some friends</p>
<p t="8402220" d="3960">that&#39;s a good thing, intimate relationship, that&#39;s a good thing,</p>
<p t="8406180" d="6320">a family, you know, either the one you are going to produce or the one that you come from where people</p>
<p t="8412500" d="4360">to some degree, love and care for one another, that&#39;s a good thing to work on,</p>
<p t="8416860" d="6380">You need, you need some plan for your career, you have got to fit in somewhere that people regard as</p>
<p t="8423240" d="3360">important and that they will trade with you so that you can live</p>
<p t="8426600" d="3960">you need something worthwhile to do with the time that you are not at work</p>
<p t="8430560" d="3860">and you need to, pay attention to you mental and physical health</p>
<p t="8434680" d="3120">and you need to regulate your use of substances</p>
<p t="8437800" d="5960">which is a strange one, but alcohol does lots of people in, so it&#39;s worth thinking about so that&#39;s why we put it in there</p>
<p t="8443760" d="2080">So then it&#39;s like, what the hell do you want?</p>
<p t="8445940" d="2080">What do want from your friends?</p>
<p t="8448020" d="1340">What do you want from your family?</p>
<p t="8449360" d="1720">What do want from your career?</p>
<p t="8451080" d="2480">If you could have what you wanted, and that&#39;s what the program asks you</p>
<p t="8453820" d="3520">3 to 5 years down the road, you get to have what you want</p>
<p t="8457340" d="3660">Now I am assuming that you are going to approach this like</p>
<p t="8461440" d="7000">reasonable adults and not like 13 year old dreamers, I think, I want the most expensive yacht in the world</p>
<p t="8469360" d="2280">It&#39;s like, fine but, you know</p>
<p t="8471640" d="5180">that isn&#39;t really what, it&#39;s supposed to be more concentrating on your character</p>
<p t="8477760" d="5940">and so, then it asks you to write for 15 minutes without thinking too much about grammer</p>
<p t="8484300" d="2400">or sentence structure or any of that</p>
<p t="8486700" d="3840">about what your life could be like in 3 to 5 years down the road if,</p>
<p t="8490540" d="3620">if you were treating yourself like someone you cared for</p>
<p t="8494160" d="2960">and, you were helping them figure out what they wanted</p>
<p t="8497400" d="3360">and then, it asks you to do the same thing in reverse</p>
<p t="8501060" d="2480">which is to think about</p>
<p t="8503960" d="4760">the ways that you&#39;re radically insufficient and your faults</p>
<p t="8509040" d="3440">and everyone knows this I think, you know, maybe not</p>
<p t="8512740" d="1760">but everyone has a sense of</p>
<p t="8514500" d="3080">if they were going to degenerate how they would do it</p>
<p t="8517580" d="3620">you know, some people would be an alcoholic, some people would be a street person, and it&#39;s like</p>
<p t="8521200" d="2400">there is some doom thing out there that is</p>
<p t="8523660" d="3840">got your name on it if you are particularly incautious  and</p>
<p t="8527660" d="1440">you know, don&#39;t</p>
<p t="8530620" d="3840">and let things fall apart, so, want you to write about that</p>
<p t="8534680" d="3120">what do you not want to have happen in 3 to 5 years</p>
<p t="8538160" d="2880">and there is psychological for this, one is</p>
<p t="8541040" d="4160">If you have something to aim for, that&#39;s a source of positive emotion</p>
<p t="8545200" d="5960">because your positive emotion is mostly generated by evidence that you are moving towards something that you value</p>
<p t="8551160" d="3100">it&#39;s not generated so much by accomplishing something</p>
<p t="8554260" d="3820">because when you accomplish something, you are just left with the problem of whatever you are going to do next</p>
<p t="8558080" d="2440">so you graduate from university, it&#39;s like</p>
<p t="8560680" d="1400">you know, hurray!</p>
<p t="8562160" d="5040">one day you&#39;re at the peak of undergraduate university career, the next day</p>
<p t="8567420" d="3980">you are unemployed and looking for a bad job at Starbucks</p>
<p t="8571780" d="1120">so, you know</p>
<p t="8573020" d="2880">well you see what I mean, you know, it&#39;s that</p>
<p t="8575900" d="3360">you know, one problem that you solve is replaced by another problem</p>
<p t="8579260" d="3640">and so the idea that you are gong to be happy when you solve all your problems, is like</p>
<p t="8582940" d="2620">Hahaha! Good luck with that theory</p>
<p t="8585800" d="1000">but, but</p>
<p t="8586800" d="3840">you know if you are aiming at something worthwhile, and you really believe that it is worthwhile</p>
<p t="8590640" d="6140">and you have thought it through, you know, so that you are not weak, you are not weak, you&#39;ve got your damn arguments mustered</p>
<p t="8596780" d="4320">then when you make progress, even a little bit, you think, hey, that&#39;s alright, and you get a little kick</p>
<p t="8601140" d="1800">a little dopamine kick</p>
<p t="8602940" d="3080">and that&#39;s what you want, because that&#39;s where your positive emotion comes from</p>
<p t="8606020" d="1820">you can use cocaine if you want, but</p>
<p t="8608580" d="3680">ha, but that tends to have relatively</p>
<p t="8612260" d="2960">detrimental medium to long term consequences</p>
<p t="8615220" d="3240">but it activates the same system, so you have to aiming at something</p>
<p t="8618460" d="1880">and you should be aiming at something that&#39;s</p>
<p t="8620700" d="1080">realistic</p>
<p t="8622360" d="880">that you want</p>
<p t="8623580" d="2960">that you could get, you know, like not easily</p>
<p t="8626540" d="3200">because if it&#39;s easy, in some sense you have already got it</p>
<p t="8629740" d="3660">it&#39;s got to push you , and that&#39;s part of the pleasure actually because</p>
<p t="8633400" d="3840">there is two things that want to do when you are pursuing something that is important</p>
<p t="8637240" d="2220">and one of them is to get the thing that is important</p>
<p t="8639620" d="4240">but the other is make yourself better at pursuing things</p>
<p t="8644060" d="1080">right, so</p>
<p t="8645140" d="2760">so you can get both of those at the same time</p>
<p t="8647900" d="3140">you&#39;re aiming at something and increasing your competence at the same time</p>
<p t="8651040" d="2560">it&#39;s like, that&#39;s a good deal, that&#39;s a good deal and</p>
<p t="8653600" d="5000">there is a lot of intrinsic meaning to be felt in that, and second half of the program</p>
<p t="8659420" d="600">you,</p>
<p t="8661100" d="1280">you write out a plan</p>
<p t="8662380" d="3200">for how you are going to do it and how you are going to keep yourself on track</p>
<p t="8665580" d="2640">and you are going to write about why it would be good for you if you did this</p>
<p t="8668220" d="1700">and why it would be good for your family</p>
<p t="8669920" d="2460">and what possible benefits it would have to the comminuty</p>
<p t="8672380" d="3460">and. you know, because you want to nail this thing down and then you want to</p>
<p t="8675840" d="3860">figure out what kind of obstacles are going to come up and how you might overcome them</p>
<p t="8679700" d="3020">and how you might keep yourself on track and all of that</p>
<p t="8682720" d="4800">We know, because we have actually done a lot research on this particular program</p>
<p t="8687680" d="500">that</p>
<p t="8688940" d="4480">if university students do this, and this is more true if they&#39;re not</p>
<p t="8693480" d="2000">to well oriented to begin with</p>
<p t="8695480" d="2400">if university students do this they are</p>
<p t="8698460" d="3460">about 25% less likely to drop out, which is a lot</p>
<p t="8701920" d="3360">and about, their grade point average increases about 20%</p>
<p t="8705960" d="500">so,</p>
<p t="8706460" d="5520">Hurray for that, because you never know when you develop an intervention if it&#39;s going to work</p>
<p t="8711980" d="2340">there is also evidence, but not from my lab</p>
<p t="8714320" d="3360">that doing such things improves your physical health</p>
<p t="8717680" d="3820">and I think the reason for that is, is that when you go over your autobiography</p>
<p t="8721500" d="4180">and you scour out those negative places that you are sort of dragging along with you</p>
<p t="8725720" d="2320">it lowers your overall stress load</p>
<p t="8728040" d="5240">because your brain is kind of, I think it is calculating how dangerous the world is</p>
<p t="8733500" d="2520">by attending to the ratio of</p>
<p t="8736020" d="4660">successes to failures that you have had in your life, something like that and so</p>
<p t="8740680" d="3320">you know if there are holes in your map that you could still fall through</p>
<p t="8744000" d="4680">then your brain regards the territory still as a bit on the dangerous side</p>
<p t="8748680" d="4480">and then, you are more prepared for emergency action and that hard on you, so</p>
<p t="8753460" d="2640">you want to go back there and fix up those</p>
<p t="8757400" d="2560">experiences to the degree that you can</p>
<p t="8759960" d="500">Now,</p>
<p t="8761760" d="2260">those are going to be peer rated</p>
<p t="8764240" d="3120">now that&#39;s complicated but here&#39;s how you do it</p>
<p t="8767600" d="2640">write the thing so that you</p>
<p t="8771020" d="1520">have written it for you</p>
<p t="8773000" d="2960">and then take everything out that you are not</p>
<p t="8775960" d="2000">comfortable sharing with other people</p>
<p t="8777960" d="3040">and so, there is a couple of reasons that I do it that was</p>
<p t="8781000" d="2440">one is just, there is just no other way to do it</p>
<p t="8783440" d="560">because</p>
<p t="8785000" d="1760">if I want to do this with you</p>
<p t="8787020" d="2840">the grading load is too high to do it</p>
<p t="8789860" d="6960">so, I thought well it is still worth doing, and because this is a class about narrative and about self narrative it&#39;s the right thing to do</p>
<p t="8796820" d="2920">and most of you are graduating soon, and it&#39;s like</p>
<p t="8799740" d="3740">it&#39;s helpful, I think that you will find it very helpful, that is what students report</p>
<p t="8804240" d="500">and so,</p>
<p t="8805560" d="1120">You&#39;ll each read</p>
<p t="8808800" d="2320">Three people will read each of your</p>
<p t="8813120" d="5280">offerings and give you a grade and then you get the average of the best two grades</p>
<p t="8818400" d="3240">and they are supposed to provide you with constructive feedback</p>
<p t="8821640" d="4020">constructive feedback is sort of mostly what did you do right</p>
<p t="8825660" d="3540">and maybe some hints about where you could flesh it out, and all that</p>
<p t="8829540" d="3200">but, so that&#39;s that and you need to write an essay</p>
<p t="8833200" d="2940">this is all detailed on the website</p>
<p t="8837520" d="5840">and, that&#39;s the website, if you go to jordonbpeterson.com, on the left there is classes</p>
<p t="8843360" d="5860">if you click classes you get a bunch of tabs and one of the tabs is Psych 434, and that&#39;s obviously this class</p>
<p t="8849780" d="2480">there is some extra readings on there</p>
<p t="8852260" d="3440">and a list of how we are going to go through the course</p>
<p t="8855700" d="4580">the dates aren&#39;t right, I have got to update it and I haven&#39;t finished that yet, but</p>
<p t="8860280" d="2340">the rest of it is pretty much the way it is,</p>
<p t="8862620" d="5540">This writing program is an online program and it guides you through the process of doing it but really</p>
<p t="8868680" d="2640">I would really recommend that you start</p>
<p t="8871700" d="960">like this week</p>
<p t="8873040" d="600">because</p>
<p t="8873640" d="3600">it also works better if you do it over time, and it seems</p>
<p t="8877240" d="2100">like in bursts of writing, you know</p>
<p t="8879340" d="5080">and to sleep between episodes because that&#39;s when your brain consolidates its new information</p>
<p t="8885060" d="2880">and, I would say do it meditatively</p>
<p t="8889000" d="1880">you know, ask yourself</p>
<p t="8891320" d="2480">ask yourself, it&#39;s a different way of</p>
<p t="8893800" d="4360">it&#39;s really funny when you ask yourself questions because part of you will answer</p>
<p t="8898160" d="2040">and you don&#39;t know what the answer will be</p>
<p t="8900200" d="2560">but, and answer comes almost always and</p>
<p t="8902760" d="5780">you know, like you think well what happened to me when I was six, around six that was important</p>
<p t="8909160" d="500">and,</p>
<p t="8910540" d="4480">through some mysterious process perhaps a memory will come to mind</p>
<p t="8915620" d="580">so,</p>
<p t="8917100" d="960">there is a test</p>
<p t="8918620" d="1360">so there is these two</p>
<p t="8920760" d="1840">assignments plus the essay</p>
<p t="8923480" d="640">the essay</p>
<p t="8924520" d="1760">can be on anything you want</p>
<p t="8927060" d="1840">that&#39;s related to the class</p>
<p t="8928900" d="2820">you have to make the case that&#39;s related to the class</p>
<p t="8932340" d="500">so,</p>
<p t="8932980" d="1360">it&#39;s an opportunity to</p>
<p t="8936640" d="3360">write about something that you want to write about</p>
<p t="8942600" d="3400">and there is a final exam and the final exam</p>
<p t="8946000" d="4040">if you read the book and come to the classes you will not have any problem with the final exam because it&#39;s not</p>
<p t="8951100" d="1760">it&#39;s not tricky, it&#39;s just</p>
<p t="8953980" d="2400">a survey of what we have gone through</p>
<p t="8956960" d="3520">and so, I did that, I didn&#39;t have that to begin with but</p>
<p t="8960480" d="3640">you know, you need a carrot and a stick, because you guys are busy and</p>
<p t="8964120" d="1720">you know you are going to triage</p>
<p t="8965840" d="4680">and do the things that are crucial and perhaps not the things that aren&#39;t and no wonder so</p>
<p t="8970520" d="3240">I had to make this crucial because otherwise you won&#39;t read it</p>
<p t="8973760" d="2340">and that&#39;s partly because it is hard</p>
<p t="8976320" d="6020">and so, hopefully the course lectures will help guide you through it, and</p>
<p t="8984980" d="1440">and that&#39;s about that</p>
<p t="8987080" d="6240">So I am going to tell you about a bunch of stories, and I am going to try and explain what they mean</p>
<p t="8993540" d="2240">and what I hope will happen is that</p>
<p t="8996040" d="5040">the world of narrative will open up for you, and that</p>
<p t="9001080" d="4260">and like I found that incredibly useful, it&#39;s incredibly useful</p>
<p t="9005860" d="960">to understand</p>
<p t="9007280" d="2480">these things, it situates you better and</p>
<p t="9009760" d="4180">it also helps you, see what people tell me about this course frequently is that</p>
<p t="9018540" d="1360">it&#39;s something like</p>
<p t="9020800" d="3420">that they already knew what I am telling them</p>
<p t="9024720" d="2480">but they didn&#39;t know that they knew it</p>
<p t="9027300" d="2560">so it makes sense, it clicks, it clicks</p>
<p t="9030160" d="4320">and you know to me what that means is that you have the information</p>
<p t="9035000" d="3000">represented in you, in action</p>
<p t="9038320" d="2320">in your procedures, in your habits</p>
<p t="9040640" d="4600">and in your perceptual structures, it&#39;s implicit, it&#39;s the implicit you</p>
<p t="9045920" d="640">and then,</p>
<p t="9048520" d="2240">I can articulate in part what that</p>
<p t="9050760" d="5660">implicit you is and it fits, click, oh yeah that&#39;s what I am like, that&#39;s what people are like, that&#39;s what people are like</p>
<p t="9056940" d="500">and so,</p>
<p t="9057920" d="6400">well, if any of that happened today during this lecture to you, well, then that&#39;s a good sign that, you might</p>
<p t="9064660" d="1740">benefit from the course</p>
<p t="9066980" d="4560">if it didn&#39;t, well you could try one more lecture and see what happens</p>
<p t="9071600" d="4480">but, you know this sort of what the course is like, and</p>
<p t="9077640" d="3440">if that&#39;s what you want then, this is where you get it</p>
<p t="9082440" d="3360">Good to see all of you and I guess we are done, right?</p>
