<p t="33050" d="6779">I think of all the stories that we&#39;ve investigated
so far, all the fundamental myths of creation</p>
<p t="39829" d="4461">that we&#39;ve investigated so far, the two that
we&#39;re going to talk about in detail today</p>
<p t="44290" d="4560">are probably the two stories that have had
more impact on the course of world history</p>
<p t="48850" d="1620">than any other two.</p>
<p t="50470" d="4401">I&#39;m going to talk in some detail today about
the story of creation laid out in Genesis</p>
<p t="54871" d="4069">and also the story of the Buddha&#39;s enlightenment.</p>
<p t="58940" d="5160">Both stories are also characterized by a kind
of depth that&#39;s virtually elimitless.</p>
<p t="64100" d="6010">And I think in some ways that the topics we&#39;re
going to discuss today are the most enlightening</p>
<p t="70110" d="9600">of all the many ideas that we&#39;ve traveled
through so far in this series.</p>
<p t="79710" d="6750">So, we&#39;re gonna be concentrating on an analysis
of this schema again.</p>
<p t="86460" d="4570">The idea being here of course that the world
of experience, which is the world that mythology</p>
<p t="91030" d="6770">is attempting to describe has these fundamental
constituent elements, one associated with</p>
<p t="97800" d="7500">chaos or nature or the unknown, one associated
with culture or the great father or the predictable.</p>
<p t="105300" d="6810">And another associated with the archetypical
son, the individual who&#39;s the offspring of</p>
<p t="112110" d="5869">the interplay of these two fundamental forces
But given that part of the purpose of this</p>
<p t="117979" d="6271">series is to elucidate the causes of war and
motivation for war, attention paid to the</p>
<p t="124250" d="3970">dualistic nature of the individual is of,
of paramount importance.</p>
<p t="128220" d="4590">So we could say that just as nature has it&#39;s
terrible side and just as culture has its</p>
<p t="132810" d="4330">terrible side, so the individual has his or
her terrible side.</p>
<p t="137140" d="7550">And the depth of that, capacity say for atrocity
and vengefulness is just as deep as the depth</p>
<p t="144690" d="3090">of terror that the unknown itself holds.</p>
<p t="147780" d="7770">I think this is a difficult, a difficult fact
for normal individuals to grasp, given that</p>
<p t="155550" d="5329">we&#39;re highly motivated to view ourselves as,
if not precisely good, at least as relatively</p>
<p t="160879" d="1000">harmless.</p>
<p t="161879" d="5121">But the evidence that as individuals we are
relatively harmless is very, very thin indeed.</p>
<p t="167000" d="9000">And I don&#39;t think it&#39;s possible to understand
the depth of motivation for atrocity and social</p>
<p t="176000" d="3780">conflict without coming to terms with the
capacity for evil that&#39;s characteristic of</p>
<p t="179780" d="1000">the individual.</p>
<p t="180780" d="4940">Now both the story in Genesis and the story
of the Buddha&#39;s enlightenment, lay bare in</p>
<p t="185720" d="3600">many ways the nature of the structure of individual
evil.</p>
<p t="189320" d="2450">And also not only it&#39;s structure, but its
motivation.</p>
<p t="191770" d="6910">Why it is that people would turn more or less
voluntarily away from the good and embrace</p>
<p t="198680" d="3110">what can only be described as it&#39;s polar opposite.</p>
<p t="201790" d="6930">So in addition to making reference to this
structural schema of course, we&#39;re also going</p>
<p t="208720" d="8440">to be discussing it&#39;s, the typical mode of
interaction of these elements of experience.</p>
<p t="217160" d="5890">You may note for example that this diagram
with which you&#39;re now very familiar, the notion</p>
<p t="223050" d="4801">of order, chaos and reestablishment of order
also parallels the structure of the story</p>
<p t="227851" d="4839">in Genesis, the creation where human beings
are created first and exist in a paradisal</p>
<p t="232690" d="1000">state.</p>
<p t="233690" d="7520">That that paradise is disrupted as, as a consequence
of some, some event of virtually cosmic significance,</p>
<p t="241210" d="5470">that as a consequence of that disruption people
are destined to live a profane existence in</p>
<p t="246680" d="12010">constant wait for the next state of order.</p>
<p t="258690" d="4940">So just as this is a fundamental archetypical
structure so that fundamental archetypical</p>
<p t="263630" d="4430">structure is, constitutes the, the basic grammar
for this story in Genesis.</p>
<p t="268060" d="7139">Now what we&#39;re gonna do to begin with is to
describe precisely how this idea of paradise,</p>
<p t="275199" d="5391">descent and the search for paradise is illustrated
symbolically in Genesis and exactly what those</p>
<p t="280590" d="1870">symbolic representations mean.</p>
<p t="282460" d="4220">The idea here being that the reason that the
authors of Genesis, the multiple authors of</p>
<p t="286680" d="5590">Genesis extending over thousands and thousands
of years chose those symbols as not because</p>
<p t="292270" d="5979">they were labouring to be obscure or not because
they were establishing a pre-empirical representation</p>
<p t="298249" d="6600">of reality, a kind of quasi scientific representation,
but because these symbols have an elusive</p>
<p t="304849" d="5521">or metaphorical richness that enables a story,
although short to be characterized by an almost</p>
<p t="310370" d="1259">infinite depth.</p>
<p t="311629" d="1000">That&#39;s part of the reason.</p>
<p t="312629" d="4701">The other part of the reason is that when
you say something profound, you say it using</p>
<p t="317330" d="3339">the language, the clearest language that you
have access to.</p>
<p t="320669" d="5981">And if the story is almost unutterably profound,
then the images in which it is enshrouded</p>
<p t="326650" d="3620">are almost incomprehensibly complex.</p>
<p t="330270" d="7251">It has to be that way because if the target
of the investigation is reality itself, something</p>
<p t="337521" d="5888">so complex that we cannot conceptualize it
fully, then the language that we use to represent</p>
<p t="343409" d="3690">that reality has to stretch us to the limits
of our ability to understand</p>
<p t="347099" d="6100">and it is the case that the story in Genesis
say as much as the stories of Buddhist enlightenment</p>
<p t="353199" d="5641">constitutes an artistic endeavor on the part
of the human race to portray the nature of</p>
<p t="358840" d="6389">human reality and to explain the behavioural
and philosophical consequences of that reality.</p>
<p t="365229" d="5310">That being a tall order perhaps we should
forgive the multiple authors for only being</p>
<p t="370539" d="5841">able to manage it in a way that&#39;s essentially
imagistic and dramatic, rather than explicit,</p>
<p t="376380" d="3899">logical, philosophical and fully developed.</p>
<p t="380279" d="6631">So the first thing I&#39;d like to point out to
you is to, is a statement made by Eliade,</p>
<p t="386910" d="3580">which I think is one of the most enlightening
things I ever read.</p>
<p t="390490" d="5440">Now, the first thing that Eliade does is describe
the universality of flood mythology.</p>
<p t="395930" d="1970">But then he puts a twist on it.</p>
<p t="397900" d="8259">So the idea behind flood mythology is something
like this, if societies deviate from an emergent,</p>
<p t="406159" d="4530">a necessarily emergent kind of morality, a
kind of morality that takes the viewpoint</p>
<p t="410689" d="4340">of all the inhabitants of a given society
into account, if a society deviates from that</p>
<p t="415029" d="3751">viewpoint sufficiently, it dooms itself to
annihilation.</p>
<p t="418780" d="6789">That annihilation being represented mythologically
as the flooding of the society by the precosmogonic</p>
<p t="425569" d="3060">waters, the primordial element or chaos.</p>
<p t="428629" d="6340">So societies that are tyrannical doom themselves
to eradication by chaos, a simple equation.</p>
<p t="434969" d="5771">But made more complicated by Eliade, his observation
that more than one factor plays a role in</p>
<p t="440740" d="1379">the establishment of the tyranny.</p>
<p t="442119" d="5441">On the one hand there&#39;s straight degeneration
of cultural presuppositions in that if you</p>
<p t="447560" d="6650">establish a state or a game, which has particular
rules, because the environment is constantly</p>
<p t="454210" d="4090">transforming itself, the rules by necessity
become out of date.</p>
<p t="458300" d="5209">So merely as a consequence of the progression
of time, the presuppositions on which any</p>
<p t="463509" d="4500">state are founded tend to become less and
less relevant to the current environment.</p>
<p t="468009" d="1000">Okay.</p>
<p t="469009" d="4330">So there's this aging and senility merely
as a consequence of thermodynamic processes.</p>
<p t="473339" d="4570">But then Iliad also points out that there&#39;s
one additional factor which has to be attributed,</p>
<p t="477909" d="5810">not to society, but to the individuals that
make up that society, which is that the strictures</p>
<p t="483719" d="7111">and rules on which society was founded can
be constantly and carefully updated when necessary,</p>
<p t="490830" d="5290">If all the individuals that make up that society
are perfectly willing to confront exemplars</p>
<p t="496120" d="5169">of emerging chaos in their own lives when
those exemplars emerge, which is to say that</p>
<p t="501289" d="4130">it&#39;s perfectly reasonable to be guided in
your personality by the structures of your</p>
<p t="505419" d="1000">state.</p>
<p t="506419" d="3780">But if you face something unknown that those
rules cannot handle, it&#39;s a moral necessity</p>
<p t="510199" d="6361">and obligation on your part to face that emergent
anomaly forthrightly to solve it if you can,</p>
<p t="516560" d="3880">and then to communicate the consequences of
your solution to the rest of the members of</p>
<p t="520440" d="1000">your society.</p>
<p t="521440" d="6240">Now what Eliade points out is that the individual
who, who removes him or her self from the</p>
<p t="527680" d="6640">responsibility of confronting their own anomaly
speeds the process by which the state decays.</p>
<p t="534320" d="5740">So the decay of the state and the possibility
for the emergence of chaos is an interaction</p>
<p t="540060" d="3040">between the tenancy of the state to disorder,
the tendency of the state to, archaism and</p>
<p t="543100" d="6120">senility merely as a consequence of change
and the voluntarily the voluntary unwillingness</p>
<p t="549220" d="4539">of the citizens that comprise that state to
face the unknown courageously when it confronts</p>
<p t="553759" d="1000">them.</p>
<p t="554759" d="3630">So Eliade says: that the deluge myth, deluge
myth is almost universally disseminated.</p>
<p t="558389" d="5120">It is documented in all the continents, although
very rarely in Africa probably because of</p>
<p t="563509" d="1830">the relative shortage of water.</p>
<p t="565339" d="1541">And on various cultural levels.</p>
<p t="566880" d="4610">A certain number of variants seem to be the
result of dissemination, first from Mesopotamia</p>
<p t="571490" d="1430">and then from India.</p>
<p t="572920" d="5919">It is equally possible that one or several
diluvial catastrophes gave rise to fabulous</p>
<p t="578839" d="4480">narratives, but it would be risky to explain
so widespread a myth by phenomena of which</p>
<p t="583319" d="1404">no geological traces have been found.</p>
<p t="584723" d="5106">That majority of the flood myths seem in some
sense to form part of the cosmic rhythm.</p>
<p t="589829" d="5430">The old world, people by a fallen humanity
is submerged under the water and sometime</p>
<p t="595259" d="2890">later a new world emerges from the aquatic
chaos.</p>
<p t="598149" d="5321">In a large number of variants the flood is
the result of the sins or ritual faults of</p>
<p t="603470" d="1610">human beings.</p>
<p t="605080" d="5420">Sometimes it results simply from the wish
of a divine being to put an end to mankind.</p>
<p t="610500" d="3779">The chief causes lie at once therefore in
the sins of men and the decrepitude of the</p>
<p t="614279" d="1000">world.</p>
<p t="615279" d="5680">by the mere fact that it exists - That is,
that it lives and produces - The cosmos gradually</p>
<p t="620959" d="2380">deteriorates and ends by falling into decay.</p>
<p t="623339" d="2550">This is the reason why it has to be recreated.</p>
<p t="625889" d="5401">In other words, the flood realizes on a macrocosmic
scale what is symbolically affected during</p>
<p t="631290" d="1210">the New Year festival.</p>
<p t="632500" d="10960">The end of the world and the end of a sinful
humanity in order to make a new creation possible.</p>
<p t="643460" d="4510">So then the question might arise logically
enough, what is it that would motivate an</p>
<p t="647970" d="4510">individual to work to avoid anomaly when it
emerges in his or her own life.</p>
<p t="652480" d="2150">And to risk an eventual flood.</p>
<p t="654630" d="6790">And even more profoundly, what would motivate
an individual perhaps to work for the antithesis</p>
<p t="661420" d="5260">of order, to work to promote the emergence
of chaos, since we know that people are relatively</p>
<p t="666680" d="6760">ambivalent in their moral stance
Is it possible that we can create a compelling</p>
<p t="673440" d="7310">motivational story for the desire of the individual
as such to work against the emergence of the</p>
<p t="680750" d="2980">good rather than for it.</p>
<p t="683730" d="3279">So let&#39;s take a look at what Genesis says
about the creation of experience.</p>
<p t="687009" d="5071">So first of all, remember we&#39;re taking a phenomenological
stance on this story, which is to say that</p>
<p t="692080" d="6460">this story is not an objective retelling of,
of materialistic emergence.</p>
<p t="698540" d="2970">It's something more specifically dramatic.</p>
<p t="701510" d="2540">It describes the nature of human experience.</p>
<p t="704050" d="1000">Okay?</p>
<p t="705050" d="1479">The nature of conscious human experience.</p>
<p t="706529" d="6670">And in fact the creation story of Genesis
lays explicit stress on individual consciousness</p>
<p t="713199" d="3541">literally as a precondition for being itself.</p>
<p t="716740" d="4959">Which is to say that underlying the story
of Genesis is the notion that without whatever</p>
<p t="721699" d="5111">consciousness is, there would be no segregated
entities and therefore no being.</p>
<p t="726810" d="5930">So this is one manner in which Genesis attempts
to put human beings at the centre of the cosmos,</p>
<p t="732740" d="6180">so to speak, which is the idea that the world
independently of consciousness, whatever that</p>
<p t="738920" d="6039">world is absolutely needs to be reflected
by consciousness in order to exist in any</p>
<p t="744959" d="3831">sense that existence could reasonably be defined.</p>
<p t="748790" d="4590">First chapter:
&quot;In the beginning God created the heaven and</p>
<p t="753380" d="1000">the earth.</p>
<p t="754380" d="1030">And the earth was without form and void.</p>
<p t="755410" d="2260">And darkness was on the face of the deep.&quot;</p>
<p t="757670" d="4620">Now, the idea that the earth was without form
and void takes us back to the [13:48:55] Mesopotamian</p>
<p t="762290" d="6599">creation myth and because the word for void,
the Hebrew word for void is “Tehom”.</p>
<p t="768889" d="3541">And “Tehom” is a word derived from Timat.</p>
<p t="772430" d="6230">And the void, the chaos that constitutes the
unformed condition of the cosmos prior to</p>
<p t="778660" d="6229">the elaboration of being is assimilated to
the same category as Timat, which is this</p>
<p t="784889" d="6471">terrible unformed and frightening aprioric
condition that has to be courageously confronted</p>
<p t="791360" d="2210">in order to manifest itself as being.</p>
<p t="793570" d="3880">&quot;And the earth was without form and void and
darkness was on the face of the deep.&quot;</p>
<p t="797450" d="5860">So now you see another, another interplay
of opposites here between matter and water,</p>
<p t="803310" d="1310">the primordial elements.</p>
<p t="804620" d="1680">So first of all it&#39;s heaven and earth.</p>
<p t="806300" d="4120">And then it&#39;s earth and water and, and the
height and the deep.</p>
<p t="810420" d="3200">And the spirit of God moved upon the face
of the water.</p>
<p t="813620" d="6019">So another opposite: that interaction between
spirit and whatever it is that the precosmogonic</p>
<p t="819639" d="2361">water or chaos constitutes.</p>
<p t="822000" d="2779">&quot;And God said let there be light.</p>
<p t="824779" d="1000">And there was light.</p>
<p t="825779" d="1641">And God saw the light, that it was good.</p>
<p t="827420" d="1949">And God divided the light from the darkness.</p>
<p t="829369" d="1000">&quot;</p>
<p t="830369" d="4020">And then a prototypical division between light,
which is associated with illumination and</p>
<p t="834389" d="4390">enlightenment and consciousness because we&#39;re
conscious during the day.</p>
<p t="838779" d="8691">And the sun and life that emerges nested inside
this, the initial opening lines of this sentence.</p>
<p t="847470" d="5590">Northrop Frye notes that there&#39;s tremendous
emphasis on the notion of a repetitive cycling</p>
<p t="853060" d="5329">of days and nights in the opening sentences
of Genesis, even though from a formal perspective</p>
<p t="858389" d="5851">this emphasis is paradoxical because the notion
of the day emerges before the creation of</p>
<p t="864240" d="1000">the sun.</p>
<p t="865240" d="4320">And Fry&#39;s point is not that this is some careless
gesture on the part of the people who authored</p>
<p t="869560" d="1000">Genesis.</p>
<p t="870560" d="4920">But more that it&#39;s an attempt to emphasize
the idea of a cyclical relationship between</p>
<p t="875480" d="6140">consciousness and light and darkness and chaos
and to highlight the idea that this cyclical</p>
<p t="881620" d="5130">relationship is somehow absolutely vital to
being itself.</p>
<p t="886750" d="5819">So Genesis one five says &quot;and God called the
light day and the darkness he called night.</p>
<p t="892569" d="1911">And the evening and the morning were the first
day &quot;</p>
<p t="894480" d="4640">Frye says &quot;... the central metaphor underlying
beginning is not really birth at all.</p>
<p t="899120" d="2889">It is rather the moment of waking from sleep.</p>
<p t="902009" d="5981">When one world disappears, a world of virtuality
and potential, and another comes into actual</p>
<p t="907990" d="1000">being.</p>
<p t="908990" d="1909">This is still contained within a cycle.</p>
<p t="910899" d="3560">We know that at the end of the day we shall
return to the world of sleep...&quot;</p>
<p t="914459" d="4990">and that&#39;s a notion that has a metaphorical
resonance because there&#39;s the sleep that punctuates</p>
<p t="919449" d="1000">periods of consciousness.</p>
<p t="920449" d="4690">And then there&#39;s the great sleep at the end
of life, which is characterized by the complete</p>
<p t="925139" d="2731">cessation of consciousness.</p>
<p t="927870" d="3120">We know that at the end of the day we shall
return to the world of sleep.</p>
<p t="930990" d="4899">But in the meantime there&#39;s a sense of self-transcendence
of a consciousness getting up from an unreal</p>
<p t="935889" d="2871">into a real or at least more real world.</p>
<p t="938760" d="5100">This sense of awakening into a greater degree
of reality is expressed by Haraclitis as a</p>
<p t="943860" d="5159">passing from a world where everyone has his
own logos, into a world where there&#39;s a common</p>
<p t="949019" d="3141">logos - experience that we all share.</p>
<p t="952160" d="5429">&quot;Genesis presents the creation as a sudden
coming into being of a world through articulate</p>
<p t="957589" d="6821">speech, which is another aspect of logos&quot;logos
incorporates the idea of creative exploration,</p>
<p t="964410" d="5000">And then the formulation of the consequences
of that exploration in verbally communicable</p>
<p t="969410" d="1320">categories
Right?</p>
<p t="970730" d="5740">Which give our, give our aspects of our being
their defined boundaries and parameters and</p>
<p t="976470" d="5880">enable us to establish a shared mode of social
being- through articulate speech conscious</p>
<p t="982350" d="2190">perception light and stability.</p>
<p t="984540" d="3190">Something like this metaphor of awakening
may be the real reason for the emphasis on</p>
<p t="987730" d="1789">days and such recurring phrases.</p>
<p t="989519" d="3860">&quot;And the evening and the morning were the
first day&quot;, even before the day as we know</p>
<p t="993379" d="8510">it was established with the creating of the
sun</p>
<p t="1001889" d="6221">The most fundamental pair of conflicting and
cyclically interacting pairs of opposites</p>
<p t="1008110" d="7269">that is portrayed in Genesis is essentially
the pairing of chaos versus order, chaos versus</p>
<p t="1015379" d="1661">generative order.</p>
<p t="1017040" d="5109">And a poem by F.I Tiuitchev expresses this
idea extremely well and very powerfully.</p>
<p t="1022149" d="1531">So I&#39;m going to read it to you.</p>
<p t="1023680" d="5040">When sacred night sweeps heavenward she takes
the glad the winsome day.</p>
<p t="1028720" d="3339">Unfolding it,
rolls up it&#39;s golden carpet that had been</p>
<p t="1032059" d="2871">spread over an abysmal pit.</p>
<p t="1034930" d="2390">Gone vision like as the external world.</p>
<p t="1037320" d="5050">And man a homeless orphan has to face
in utter helplessness naked, alone</p>
<p t="1042370" d="2300">the blackness of immeasurable space.</p>
<p t="1044670" d="6410">Upon himself he has to lean with mind
abolished, thought unfathered in the dim</p>
<p t="1051080" d="1979">depths of his soul he sinks.</p>
<p t="1053059" d="3101">For nothing comes
from outside to support or limit him.</p>
<p t="1056160" d="5580">All life and brightness seem an ancient dream
while in the substance of the night</p>
<p t="1061740" d="6020">unraveled, alien, he now perceives
a faithful something that is his by right.</p>
<p t="1067760" d="3550">Um, absolutely brilliant poetic statement,
I think.</p>
<p t="1071310" d="6270">Laying out very nicely, very richly the, the
fundamental nature of the existential paradox</p>
<p t="1077580" d="2180">that constitutes human life.</p>
<p t="1079760" d="4150">Pointing to a very profound sense of futility
and fear.</p>
<p t="1083910" d="4950">But then beyond that to the notion that in
the depths of the unknown, in the depths of</p>
<p t="1088860" d="5660">the darkness and in the depths of all that,
that&#39;s fundamentally unfaceable, there still</p>
<p t="1094520" d="6390">lurks something that can be discovered given
sufficient courage.</p>
<p t="1100910" d="6590">Another fundamental division portrayed indirectly
in Genesis, the word versus chaos.</p>
<p t="1107500" d="4920">So what you have in genesis is an absolutely
stellar idea.</p>
<p t="1112420" d="6110">I think perhaps the most fundamental contribution
of archaic Jewish thinking to western and</p>
<p t="1118530" d="5130">world civilization, which is that although
it is easier in some ways to consider the</p>
<p t="1123660" d="6270">actual matrix of things, their material substrate
as the strata from which they emerge, it is</p>
<p t="1129930" d="7190">equally reasonable and perhaps more pragmatically
useful to note that things only exist because</p>
<p t="1137120" d="4670">of the interaction between the logos, the
word that characterizes consciousness.</p>
<p t="1141790" d="1650">And whatever this matrix is.</p>
<p t="1143440" d="5600">So in Jewish thought and then Christian thought,
and of course in thoughts of that sort echoed</p>
<p t="1149040" d="5420">throughout the world, there&#39;s the idea that
consciousness associated with the transcendent</p>
<p t="1154460" d="5340">directly associated with the deity is actually
the thing that in interaction with this matrix</p>
<p t="1159800" d="3730">give, gives rise to being.</p>
<p t="1163530" d="5840">Genesis plays a stress, places stress on this
notion of the internal logos, the individual</p>
<p t="1169370" d="2420">consciousness in two very complex ways.</p>
<p t="1171790" d="6840">It first says that it&#39;s the word of God, the
logos of God that gives, that gives order</p>
<p t="1178630" d="2070">to chaos and makes being emerge.</p>
<p t="1180700" d="7400">But then even more particularly it&#39;s the,
it's the self-conscious logos of individual</p>
<p t="1188100" d="3770">humans, their capacity not just to see the
world as an object.</p>
<p t="1191870" d="5530">But also to see themselves as an object that
gives the world the particular value slant</p>
<p t="1197400" d="1060">that it has for us.</p>
<p t="1198460" d="5480">which is to say that not only are we in a
world where the subject and the object are</p>
<p t="1203940" d="1050">separated.</p>
<p t="1204990" d="4720">And, and therefore experience and suffer the
consequences of that separation-But even more</p>
<p t="1209710" d="6450">particularly we are the only creatures who
are so conscious that we can observe ourself</p>
<p t="1216160" d="1000">as objects.</p>
<p t="1217160" d="4610">And the consequence of that is that because
we&#39;ve extended our consciousness to ourself,</p>
<p t="1221770" d="4550">we&#39;re capable of conceptualizing things that
other creatures cannot conceptualize.</p>
<p t="1226320" d="5290">Such as the infinite possibility that lays
manifest of the unknown but also the fact</p>
<p t="1231610" d="6100">that as individuals we&#39;re subject to our finite
limitations, right?</p>
<p t="1237710" d="1670">That we can become diseased.</p>
<p t="1239380" d="1430">That we can become mentally ill.</p>
<p t="1240810" d="2030">And that finally we&#39;ll die.</p>
<p t="1242840" d="5630">And so the idea here is that something like
the extension of logos to the object, to the</p>
<p t="1248470" d="7520">subject has made human existence finally problematic.</p>
<p t="1255990" d="5130">And genesis refers to this as essentially
the heritable sin of Adam.</p>
<p t="1261120" d="6290">Because we&#39;re aware of our own vulnerability
as a genetic consequence merely of being human.</p>
<p t="1267410" d="6000">There&#39;s a transformation in the nature of
experience that has essentially cosmic significance.</p>
<p t="1273410" d="10890">Lao Tzu in the Tao Te Ching makes a comment
on the formless chaos that constitutes the</p>
<p t="1284300" d="3130">matrix of things, the origin of things in
the following manner.</p>
<p t="1287430" d="5960">He says &quot;there was something formless yet
complete that existed before heaven and earth</p>
<p t="1293390" d="2180">without sound, without substance.</p>
<p t="1295570" d="1710">&quot;
This is the void or the chaos.</p>
<p t="1297280" d="3650">&quot;Dependent on nothing, unchanging all pervading.</p>
<p t="1300930" d="1000">Unfailing.</p>
<p t="1301930" d="2570">One may think of it as the mother of all things
under heaven.&quot;</p>
<p t="1304500" d="6820">The idea here being that whatever experience
is in the absence of a delimited human consciousness,</p>
<p t="1311320" d="2790">is something that's outside the boundaries
of time.</p>
<p t="1314110" d="2820">Because time -temporality is a human attribute.</p>
<p t="1316930" d="5100">And it&#39;s outside the boundaries of spatial
limitation because only human beings with</p>
<p t="1322030" d="6720">their delimited and fixed size can attribute
spatial aspects to being itself.</p>
<p t="1328750" d="6290">So whatever it is, is that exists without
us, is so comprehensive and so complete and</p>
<p t="1335040" d="6610">transcends temporal dimensions to such a great
degree that it can&#39;t be conceptualized as</p>
<p t="1341650" d="1330">being at all.</p>
<p t="1342980" d="3910">It's something that transcends being to
such a degree that it&#39;s not even nameable</p>
<p t="1346890" d="5200">but still exists as &quot;the mother of all things
under heaven&quot;.</p>
<p t="1352090" d="7300">Now Genesis formally associates the human
being with logos.</p>
<p t="1359390" d="6980">And this is a determinative move in human
history just as the Mesopotamians first hypothesized</p>
<p t="1366370" d="5530">that their emperor was equivalent to Marduk,
the force that confronted Timat and carved</p>
<p t="1371900" d="5180">her into pieces and made the world, and just
as the Egyptians conceptualized their pharaoh</p>
<p t="1377080" d="6370">as the intermingling between Osiris, the stability
of the state and Horus the exploratory hero.</p>
<p t="1383450" d="5710">And then disseminated that identity down the
aristocratic levels, closer and closer to</p>
<p t="1389160" d="2120">the individual, individual.</p>
<p t="1391280" d="7390">So the ancient Hebrews said, “and God said
let us make man in our image after our likeness.”</p>
<p t="1398670" d="6800">Now, it could be said that the logical derivation
of that statement is that god looks like human</p>
<p t="1405470" d="1000">beings.</p>
<p t="1406470" d="2230">Or conversely that God is an old man with
a beard.</p>
<p t="1408700" d="3620">But it means something I think that&#39;s more
sophisticated than that.</p>
<p t="1412320" d="6030">Which is that the central aspect that&#39;s associated
with this transcendent deity, the logos, which</p>
<p t="1418350" d="5330">is the thing that gives rise to order as a
consequence of it&#39;s confrontation with chaos</p>
<p t="1423680" d="3880">is also the thing that centrally characterizes
human consciousness.</p>
<p t="1427560" d="5910">And so with that there&#39;s this transcendent
notion that inside each human being is a spark</p>
<p t="1433470" d="1990">of genuine divinity.</p>
<p t="1435460" d="5040">And it's the manifestation of that divinity
in human temporal and spatial parameters that</p>
<p t="1440500" d="4670">literally keeps the cosmos generating.</p>
<p t="1445170" d="8100">&quot;So God created his, man in his own image
in the image of God created he, him.</p>
<p t="1453270" d="4990">Male and female created he them and let them
have dominion over the fish of the sea and</p>
<p t="1458260" d="4110">the fowl of the air and over the cattle and
over all the earth and over every creeping</p>
<p t="1462370" d="1800">thing that creepeth upon the earth.</p>
<p t="1464170" d="1000">&quot;</p>
<p t="1465170" d="3450">Now fundamentalist Christians read this as
an injunction, right?</p>
<p t="1468620" d="4030">This is what human beings should do, dominate
all other living things.</p>
<p t="1472650" d="4300">But it&#39;s more like a description, which is
that the consequence of the embeddedness of</p>
<p t="1476950" d="5150">this spark of divinity in the individual is
precisely what gave rise to the human ability</p>
<p t="1482100" d="1340">to dominate the planet.</p>
<p t="1483440" d="4810">Which is an ability that at least at the moment
seems fundamentally unparalleled, with no</p>
<p t="1488250" d="2020">limit in sight.</p>
<p t="1490270" d="4180">So it&#39;s not an injunction so much as a cold-hearted
description.</p>
<p t="1494450" d="6720">There&#39;s a very profound idea underlying the
necessity of the creation of the individual</p>
<p t="1501170" d="1000">human being.</p>
<p t="1502170" d="4900">Here&#39;s a line of archaic Jewish speculation
that runs something like this:</p>
<p t="1507070" d="7340">Why is the creation of a limited subject necessary
if God&#39;s omniscient and omnipotent and omnipresent?</p>
<p t="1514410" d="2940">Why would he bother creating anything outside
of himself?</p>
<p t="1517350" d="2820">And the line of speculation runs like this.</p>
<p t="1520170" d="6780">The one thing that a being that is complete
in all regards even all hypothetical regards</p>
<p t="1526950" d="3170">lacks by necessity his limitation.</p>
<p t="1530120" d="6030">And as a consequence of that anything that&#39;s
absolute is not complete and can&#39;t be complete</p>
<p t="1536150" d="1150">without limitation.</p>
<p t="1537300" d="3271">And so there&#39;s an emergent idea in Genesis.</p>
<p t="1540571" d="5399">And most notions of the emergence of human
consciousness that the absolute needs the</p>
<p t="1545970" d="6620">reflection point of a delimited being to actually
spring into some kind of defined actuality.</p>
<p t="1552590" d="5600">So that being itself becomes an interplay
between the necessary limitations of the finite</p>
<p t="1558190" d="4200">and the transcendent reality of the absolute.</p>
<p t="1562390" d="7580">And so being is something that emerges because
of the fact as another ancient Jewish tradition</p>
<p t="1569970" d="5190">has it, God and man are in a sense twins,
mutually dependent on one another for their</p>
<p t="1575160" d="3420">defined being.</p>
<p t="1578580" d="4070">From such a perspective, being has the same
nature as a game.</p>
<p t="1582650" d="2520">When you&#39;re playing a game you have to play
by rules.</p>
<p t="1585170" d="4310">Which means that there are things that you
can do while playing the game.</p>
<p t="1589480" d="1260">But there are many, many things you can&#39;t
do.</p>
<p t="1590740" d="4100">And that the game could not exist without
the limitations.</p>
<p t="1594840" d="4240">Also predicated on the idea that the imposition,
the Nietzschian idea that the imposition of</p>
<p t="1599080" d="5980">limitations on a structure actually gives
rise to the possibility of diverse new forms.</p>
<p t="1605060" d="4440">Which is also a very sophisticated way of
conceptualizing the world.</p>
<p t="1609500" d="7230">So from the perspective of Genesis, the individual
is the locale of the experiential drama.</p>
<p t="1616730" d="57670">And the fact that the individual is limited
is a necessary precondition for being.</p>
