<p t="32780" d="6760">So let's take a look at the structure of
paradise as it's presented in Genesis.</p>
<p t="39540" d="4460">So the first aspect of the initial paradaisal
state is un-selfconsciousness.</p>
<p t="44000" d="6739">Now if you look and factor analytic studies
of human personality you note that self-consciousness</p>
<p t="50739" d="5651">although it is arguably our greatest gift
also loads almost entirely on the factor that</p>
<p t="56390" d="1640">defines negative affect.</p>
<p t="58030" d="5619">And you might also notice that when you say,
I became self-conscious you generally put</p>
<p t="63649" d="4341">a negative cast on that in that I was talking
before a group of people and suddenly I was</p>
<p t="67990" d="1910">seized by self-consciousness.</p>
<p t="69900" d="4680">And as a consequence of that I was flooded
by negative emotion and was fundamentally</p>
<p t="74580" d="1000">immobilized.</p>
<p t="75580" d="6590">So it's a very paradoxical, a very paradoxical
state of being, our highest rational gift</p>
<p t="82170" d="6970">say, and the only on that clearly distinguishes
us from animals is also that which, when manifested,</p>
<p t="89140" d="2979">makes us almost unbearable anxious</p>
<p t="92119" d="4151">The initial paradaisal state when Adam and
Eve first walked in the Garden of Eden is</p>
<p t="96270" d="4559">characterized by an animal-like unselfconsciousness.</p>
<p t="100829" d="5131">Adam and Eve, whatever they are, are not clearly
segregated from the rest of the world.</p>
<p t="105960" d="3199">They have no idea, for example, of their own
nakedness.</p>
<p t="109159" d="4460">And if you think about what nakedness means,
you immediately understand that that's also</p>
<p t="113619" d="4070">a very profound, dramatic representation.</p>
<p t="117689" d="4511">You know with children around the age of 3
or 4, many of them regardless of their mode</p>
<p t="122200" d="5230">of upbringing, start to become very concerned
about privacy, say with regard to bodily functions</p>
<p t="127430" d="4130">and also very concerned about ever showing
themselves without clothing</p>
<p t="131560" d="6860">and it's perfectly reasonable to presume
that that's a consequence of their emergent</p>
<p t="138420" d="4370">self-consciousness, an event that takes place
somewhere between the ages of 2 and 5 and</p>
<p t="142790" d="4870">that's a defining moment that makes them
segregatable, say from their mother.</p>
<p t="147660" d="6500">And so you also have images of Paradise that
flow through Western history that are characterized</p>
<p t="154160" d="5650">by the image of the unconscious union between
the mother and child</p>
<p t="159810" d="6670">which is an imagistic representation that
eradicates the tension of self-consciousness</p>
<p t="166480" d="2810">both for the mother and for the child.</p>
<p t="169290" d="5919">So the notion that the child is living in
a paradaisal condition that is somehow lost</p>
<p t="175209" d="5110">as he or she approaches adulthood gives another
sort of symbolic layer to the notion of the</p>
<p t="180319" d="2401">pre-selfconscious paradise.</p>
<p t="182720" d="4710">It's also a place where order and chaos
are in perfect balance</p>
<p t="187430" d="7500">and you know that because what paradise means
is para – around, daisa – a wall, while</p>
<p t="194930" d="4199">Eden means delight or a place of delight.</p>
<p t="199129" d="4811">Paradaisa, paradise is a walled garden, a
walled place of delight</p>
<p t="203940" d="5670">and a garden is precisely that place where
the forces of nature or chaos and the forces</p>
<p t="209610" d="3060">of culture are held in perfect balance, right?</p>
<p t="212670" d="1410">That's what a garden is.</p>
<p t="214080" d="4750">It's nature given form by culture and it's
a place that's archetypically pleasant a</p>
<p t="218830" d="5800">place where the intervention of human activity
has produced a kind of stability that transcends</p>
<p t="224630" d="6059">that of nature because it's a cultural construct
but also that transcends that of culture because</p>
<p t="230689" d="5171">all of the plants and the other growing things
that constitute a garden are somehow transcendent</p>
<p t="235860" d="7969">even though they're under the cultivating
hand of culture and the individual.</p>
<p t="243829" d="6220">If you look at the manner in which the fall
story is represented, you can also see that</p>
<p t="250049" d="4591">the place of craziest stability can be regarded
as a kind of paradise.</p>
<p t="254640" d="4409">So if you remember the story of Moses leading
his people through the desert, it's clearly</p>
<p t="259049" d="3591">the case that when the Israelites were in
the desert, even though they got away from</p>
<p t="262640" d="5220">the tyranny it was easy to look back and say
well you know, tough as it was, the place</p>
<p t="267860" d="3380">that we were before was much better than the
place we are now.</p>
<p t="271240" d="5941">So it's perfectly reasonable and expectable
for people who are caught in a crisis to look</p>
<p t="277181" d="5849">back to the time prior to the dawn of that
crisis with longing even if the crisis that</p>
<p t="283030" d="4870">they're presently experiencing is a necessary
precondition for further development of personality.</p>
<p t="287900" d="5870">So the story that's laid out in Genesis
has its structure something like this.</p>
<p t="293770" d="3940">Before we became self-conscious the world
was perfect.</p>
<p t="297710" d="4080">As a consequence of the rise of self-consciousness
we were thrown out of the Garden of Eden,</p>
<p t="301790" d="5400">out of paradise and destined to live the profane
existence that characterizes our present mode</p>
<p t="307190" d="4270">of being where we're subject to knowledge
of mortality and the possibility of Illness</p>
<p t="311460" d="2160">and alienation from God.</p>
<p t="313620" d="5970">And wouldn't it be ever so great if we could
only return to that condition of unself-consciousness</p>
<p t="319590" d="1590">and make all our problems go away.</p>
<p t="321180" d="6290">And you see this kind of pathological paradaisal
reminiscence manifesting itself in the most</p>
<p t="327470" d="6290">banal forms of conservatism which are always
projecting the ideal – the ideal path somewhere</p>
<p t="333760" d="3490">back into the unattainable reaches of time.</p>
<p t="337250" d="5680">And also in those situations that obtain psychologically
when people are absolutely possessed by depression</p>
<p t="342930" d="7380">and anxiety and wish for their consciousness
to come to an end if not metaphorically so</p>
<p t="350310" d="6880">they desire to sleep, then actually so that
suicide is viewed as a kind of unconsciousness</p>
<p t="357190" d="5699">whose paradaisal nature, the absence of all
opposition, is viewed as clearly preferable</p>
<p t="362889" d="4411">to the difficulties of actually maintaining
being.</p>
<p t="367300" d="10390">Eliade says, the idea of paradise once and
then paradise lost is not something unique</p>
<p t="377690" d="2670">to Western or great Eastern societies.</p>
<p t="380360" d="6100">It's a widespread motif, just as wide as
the flood motif.</p>
<p t="386460" d="2850">Regardless of where you go in the world you
find this notion.</p>
<p t="389310" d="5560">“When heaven had been abruptly separated
from the earth, that is when it had become</p>
<p t="394870" d="6240">remote as in our days, when the tree or vine
connecting earth to heaven had been cut or</p>
<p t="401110" d="4660">the mountain which used to touch the sky had
been flattened out then the paradaisal stage</p>
<p t="405770" d="5950">was over and man entered into his present
fallen condition.</p>
<p t="411720" d="5669">In effect all myths of paradise show us primordial
man enjoying a beatitude, a spontaneity and</p>
<p t="417389" d="4780">freedom which he has unfortunately lost in
consequence of the fall.</p>
<p t="422169" d="4911">That is of what followed upon a mythical event
that caused the rupture between heaven and</p>
<p t="427080" d="1000">earth.”</p>
<p t="428080" d="12369">As I said, Eden is delight, a place of delight,
by terminological definition whereas paradise</p>
<p t="440449" d="2620">is a walled garden.</p>
<p t="443069" d="7091">I want to show you what knowing that does
for analysis of the relationship between eastern</p>
<p t="450160" d="1610">and western thought.</p>
<p t="451770" d="6560">So let me tell you quickly the story of the
Buddha and I'm going to represent it fundamentally</p>
<p t="458330" d="2769">like this.</p>
<p t="461099" d="5171">Buddha starts his life in what's essentially
a walled garden by all – by all reasonable</p>
<p t="466270" d="1929">comparative analysis.</p>
<p t="468199" d="6961">And as a consequence of his emergent self-consciousness,
the unself-conscious child-like perfection</p>
<p t="475160" d="5500">of that early state is permanently disrupted
so you have a situation where the greatest</p>
<p t="480660" d="4819">redemption story of the East follows precisely
the same dramatical tract as the greatest</p>
<p t="485479" d="2060">creation story of the West.</p>
<p t="487539" d="1451">So this is the story.</p>
<p t="488990" d="4649">Buddha's father is visited by an angel who
tells him that his son is going to grow up</p>
<p t="493639" d="5971">to be the greatest temporal profane ruler
the world has ever seen or a great spiritual</p>
<p t="499610" d="1000">leader.</p>
<p t="500610" d="5370">And his father, being a pragmatic and conservative
man, decides that there's no possible way</p>
<p t="505980" d="4939">I'm going to allow my son to take the ambivalent
road of spiritual enlightenment.</p>
<p t="510919" d="6680">I'm going to allow him to fall completely
in love with the world so that he will remain</p>
<p t="517599" d="2591">attached to this domain.</p>
<p t="520190" d="7170">So prior to Buddha's birth, his father constructed
a great city with walls around it and inside</p>
<p t="527360" d="7830">that city he removes all signs of pain, frustration
and disappointment, any sign of ugliness and</p>
<p t="535190" d="5250">age, the only people who are allowed to exist
within this city, are those who are in perfect</p>
<p t="540440" d="4840">mental and physical health, who are paragons
of beauty and virtue.</p>
<p t="545280" d="8779">And the idea that lurks behind that archetypal
story is that when a father has a child his</p>
<p t="554059" d="5731">moral obligation is to shield the developing
consciousness of that child from contact with</p>
<p t="559790" d="6300">any of the horrors of life that could provide
the child with an experience too traumatic</p>
<p t="566090" d="2620">for that developing consciousness to apprehend.</p>
<p t="568710" d="4469">So because it's an archetypal story it relates
to the development of all people, not just</p>
<p t="573179" d="4780">the redemptive saviour and that's the motif
that the Buddhist story initially follows.</p>
<p t="577959" d="6431">A good father makes his father fall in love
with life by enticing that child into a direct</p>
<p t="584390" d="2540">relationship with all that life has to offer.</p>
<p t="586930" d="5230">So Buddha grows up within this walled garden,
this unselfconscious paradise.</p>
<p t="592160" d="5659">But precisely because he's being shielded
to this degree and allowed to mature, his</p>
<p t="597819" d="5671">consciousness continues to expand and the
world outside the boundaries that his parents</p>
<p t="603490" d="3930">have established for him starts to attract
his attention.</p>
<p t="607420" d="5600">Now we know already that the forbidden fruit,
right, the lure of what's outside the walls</p>
<p t="613020" d="4240">is something that human beings just can't
keep their mangy little paws off, right?</p>
<p t="617260" d="5280">We are absolutely uncontrollably curious and
the best way to make sure that we investigate</p>
<p t="622540" d="5159">something is to lay down a structure that
says, whatever you do under whatever circumstances</p>
<p t="627699" d="2331">never look there, right?</p>
<p t="630030" d="4610">And then the automatic systems that underlie
our orienting and that motivate our seeking</p>
<p t="634640" d="4990">experience are constantly pulling our attention
precisely to that forbidden spot, compelling</p>
<p t="639630" d="3520">us to investigate exactly that which has been
forbidden.</p>
<p t="643150" d="6860">So because Buddha is a consciousness developing
in a healthy manner he immediately becomes</p>
<p t="650010" d="4760">curious about what lies beyond the limits
that have been established with him and he</p>
<p t="654770" d="2990">makes a decision to go outside of paradise.</p>
<p t="657760" d="4410">right, which seems a particularly ridiculous
thing to do, given that in principle he had</p>
<p t="662170" d="2850">everything he could possibly want inside the
walls.</p>
<p t="665020" d="4840">But then again we have the troublesome notion
of the original sin of Adam, right, which</p>
<p t="669860" d="7340">is that if any of you were offered a forbidden
fruit again under circumstances mythologically</p>
<p t="677200" d="3970">equivalent to those that obtained in the beginning,
you'd immediately reach your hand out and</p>
<p t="681170" d="4870">take it because what we haven't got for
human beings is always far more compelling</p>
<p t="686040" d="9000">than what we have got
So Buddha goes outside the walls.</p>
<p t="695040" d="4419">But his father, who's a good father although
somewhat conservative, decides he's going</p>
<p t="699459" d="4481">to rig the game a little bit so he gets rid
of everybody that's diseased or unhappy</p>
<p t="703940" d="4360">or uncomfortable or ugly or old or anything
that could possibly disturb the Buddha.</p>
<p t="708300" d="5470">and he lines the streets with flower waving
women and puts petals on the road and sends</p>
<p t="713770" d="1810">his son out in a gilded chariot.</p>
<p t="715580" d="5020">But the gods who are lurking around, right,
the trouble making gods who represent chaos</p>
<p t="720600" d="6100">and disorder and the unknown decide to send
in front of Buddha a sick man who hobbles</p>
<p t="726700" d="6150">unsteadily into view.
and Buddha asks his retainer precisely what</p>
<p t="732850" d="5500">this phenomena represents and his retainer
says, well you know, human beings like you</p>
<p t="738350" d="5910">since you're human are subject to the deterioration
of these mere physical powers in an arbitrary</p>
<p t="744260" d="1000">way.</p>
<p t="745260" d="3180">And this man is one person who's been so
afflicted.</p>
<p t="748440" d="5930">And so Buddha is completely disenchanted by
his exploratory move out into the terrible</p>
<p t="754370" d="4260">unknown and runs back into the castle walls
and shuts the door and is perfectly happy</p>
<p t="758630" d="1590">to think of nothing for months.</p>
<p t="760220" d="6040">But then as his anxiety habituates and his
curiosity grows, he can't stand the notion</p>
<p t="766260" d="3260">of never going outside the walls again and
outside he goes again.</p>
<p t="769520" d="5659">And this time after his father prepares the
route ever so carefully the gods send inside</p>
<p t="775179" d="2511">an old man who hobbles into view.</p>
<p t="777690" d="5820">And Buddha look at him in shock and horror
and says to his retainer, just precisely what's</p>
<p t="783510" d="1309">going on here?</p>
<p t="784819" d="4081">And his retainer says, well that's an old
man.</p>
<p t="788900" d="4210">Everybody gets old and you're going to get
old too and that's the way of all humanity.</p>
<p t="793110" d="5800">And that's the point at which Buddha's
self-consciousness expands not to only include</p>
<p t="798910" d="6280">the possibility of degeneration but to include
the temporal horizon that's characteristic</p>
<p t="805190" d="1000">of life.</p>
<p t="806190" d="4790">And he finds that so terribly shocking that
he runs back into the castle and shuts the</p>
<p t="810980" d="3349">walls down and plays with his friends for
another six months until his anxiety, or maybe</p>
<p t="814329" d="4181">a year, until his anxiety finally habituates
and he goes out one final time.</p>
<p t="818510" d="6390">And this time the gods send a funeral parade
for him and he sees his first dead body.</p>
<p t="824900" d="4380">And this such a terrible shock to him that
he can't even go back to the castle.</p>
<p t="829280" d="5510">So his father prepares for him a great party
in the woods near the castle full of nude</p>
<p t="834790" d="4090">dancing women who are perfectly willing to
flaunt themselves and to offer themselves</p>
<p t="838880" d="1000">to him.</p>
<p t="839880" d="4870">But Buddha is so absolutely and catastrophically
shocked by this notion of emergent death that</p>
<p t="844750" d="4390">he can't take any pleasure whatsoever in
what's being offered to him and he leaves</p>
<p t="849140" d="2230">the kingdom once and for all.</p>
<p t="851370" d="3740">And you think, well that's exactly what
happens to you when you grow up, right?</p>
<p t="855110" d="4349">If you're reasonably well socialized and
properly looked after then your curiosity</p>
<p t="859459" d="4001">gets the better of you and you keep going
out into the world until what your parents</p>
<p t="863460" d="3609">have established for you is no longer sufficient
for you.</p>
<p t="867069" d="4061">And as a consequence of that movement out
into the world, you find out all sorts of</p>
<p t="871130" d="5539">things characteristic of your own life that
not only your parents can't precisely explain</p>
<p t="876669" d="5751">to you but even the broader formal structures
of your culture have a very difficult time</p>
<p t="882420" d="1000">handling.</p>
<p t="883420" d="6070">And when you finally do encounter such realities
and allow their effect on you to fully manifest</p>
<p t="889490" d="5849">itself well then you're finally independent
and you no longer can return home.</p>
<p t="895339" d="4511">But from that point forward you're also
burdened as Adam is burdened when he loses</p>
<p t="899850" d="6290">his paradaisal unself-consciousness with the
full revelation of what it means to be limited</p>
<p t="906140" d="1210">and alive.</p>
<p t="907350" d="3720">So what happens to Buddha as a consequence
of this revelation?</p>
<p t="911070" d="6390">He becomes an apprentice and the chronicles
of the Buddha's adventure are careful to</p>
<p t="917460" d="7300">say that he becomes the world's most proficient
practitioner of Samkhya, which was a philosophical</p>
<p t="924760" d="2500">precursor to yoga and then to yoga.</p>
<p t="927260" d="4309">So he masters all the positions and the asanas
until he's disciplined physically to an</p>
<p t="931569" d="1971">almost unlimited degree.</p>
<p t="933540" d="4889">And then he decides that he'll adopt a stance
of world renunciation which is also something</p>
<p t="938429" d="1711">he's remarkably good at.</p>
<p t="940140" d="4559">And he starves himself until the chroniclers
say he resembles nothing so much as a pile</p>
<p t="944699" d="1221">of dust.</p>
<p t="945920" d="5220">And then, having exhausted all the disciplinary
structures that his sophisticated culture</p>
<p t="951140" d="6100">has to offer him but still not precisely finding
the answer that he's looking for, he retreats</p>
<p t="957240" d="6080">into the forest, place of the unknown, and
sits himself at the base of a tree.</p>
<p t="963320" d="3200">Underneath the tree he's visited by visions
and temptations.</p>
<p t="966520" d="3140">The first vision is an essentially erotic
one.</p>
<p t="969660" d="6649">Life itself tempts him back out of his self-conscious
state into the domain of pure physical pleasure,</p>
<p t="976309" d="4221">a perfectly reasonable temptation, right,
and one that's powerful enough so that Hindu</p>
<p t="980530" d="6630">philosophers say as their churches and cathedrals
are covered with erotic drawings, if you can't</p>
<p t="987160" d="4230">get past the erotic drawings into the church
that's the domain that you should still</p>
<p t="991390" d="1080">inhabit, right.</p>
<p t="992470" d="4190">In the dawning phases of life at least till
middle age that's the appropriate mode of</p>
<p t="996660" d="5360">being to be enticed and seduced by the physical
pleasures that life has to offer.</p>
<p t="1002020" d="5850">But in the final analysis those are not sufficient
to solve the problem of emergent self-consciousness.</p>
<p t="1007870" d="7410">And so the angel of death visits him and offers
him the opportunity to exist permanently in</p>
<p t="1015280" d="1080">a state of nirvana.</p>
<p t="1016360" d="5660">A very, very interesting twist on the story
because you have to wonder, given the association</p>
<p t="1022020" d="5399">say between suicidelity and the notion of
paradise that exists underneath that, if what</p>
<p t="1027419" d="4861">Buddha isn't being offered by the angel
of death is in fact death and the cessation</p>
<p t="1032280" d="5299">of all the problems of being regardless he
rejects that, attains enlightenment briefly</p>
<p t="1037579" d="5021">and then decides to return to the world to
share what he's discovered with all of suffering</p>
<p t="1042600" d="1000">humanity.</p>
<p t="1043600" d="6160">The idea being that the Buddha who is the
awakened or enlightened one is capable of</p>
<p t="1049760" d="6680">attaining a transcendent state but also knows
fully that because human beings have a shared</p>
<p t="1056440" d="6110">social aspect it is not possible for any one
person to attain redemption until all people</p>
<p t="1062550" d="5940">attain redemption, the reason being that it's
very difficult to be transcendent and enlightened</p>
<p t="1068490" d="8310">when you see someone who's sick lying in
a ditch.</p>
<p t="1076800" d="9450">So then we shift from that back to Genesis
and the tempted fall of man and read the third</p>
<p t="1086250" d="1000">chapter.</p>
<p t="1087250" d="3160">And they were both naked, the man and his
wife and were not ashamed.</p>
<p t="1090410" d="1310">Well what does that mean?</p>
<p t="1091720" d="4230">Well, Freud pointed out that one of human
being's most common nightmares is to be</p>
<p t="1095950" d="2420">stripped of clothing in front of a crowd.</p>
<p t="1098370" d="2510">Now why would that be precisely?</p>
<p t="1100880" d="5420">Well your naked self is the most vulnerable
aspect of you, right?</p>
<p t="1106300" d="2350">We're all clothed and for good reason.</p>
<p t="1108650" d="3490">Partly that's protection from the terrible
natural world, right?</p>
<p t="1112140" d="5970">But it also offers us the possibility of placing
a barrier between ourselves, our vulnerable</p>
<p t="1118110" d="4500">selves and the searching and critical gaze
of the community, right?</p>
<p t="1122610" d="4590">Because not only are we vulnerable to the
rigours of nature, we're also vulnerable</p>
<p t="1127200" d="3940">to the depredations and criticisms of society.</p>
<p t="1131140" d="5410">And the notion that a man and a woman could
exist naked and not know it is a clear – is</p>
<p t="1136550" d="7230">a clear finger pointing in the direction of
a story that says these people were not conscious</p>
<p t="1143780" d="4090">or if conscious they certainly were not self-conscious.</p>
<p t="1147870" d="2020">And how does the story develop?</p>
<p t="1149890" d="4930">";The serpent was more subtle than any beast
of the field which the Lord God had made.</p>
<p t="1154820" d="4740">And he said unto the woman: yea, hath God
said you shall not eat of every tree in the</p>
<p t="1159560" d="1000">Garden.</p>
<p t="1160560" d="3640">And the woman said unto the serpent, well
we may eat of the fruit of the trees of the</p>
<p t="1164200" d="5740">Garden but of the fruit of the tree which
is in the centre of the Garden God has said</p>
<p t="1169940" d="3750">you should not eat of it, neither shall you
touch it lest ye die.</p>
<p t="1173690" d="7200">And the serpent said to the woman: you won't
die for God knows that in the day you eat</p>
<p t="1180890" d="6240">thereof then your eyes shall be opened, right,
a clear pointing to the notion of an awakening</p>
<p t="1187130" d="6200">and an illumination-- And ye shall be like
gods knowing good and evil,";</p>
<p t="1193330" d="6670">right, which attributes to humanity, a dawning
sense of morality explicit morality, the faculty</p>
<p t="1200000" d="3650">for comprehension that we do not share with
any other animal.</p>
<p t="1203650" d="3830">";And when the woman saw that the tree was
good for food and that it was pleasant to</p>
<p t="1207480" d="4200">the eyes and a tree to be desired to make
one wise, she took of the fruit thereof and</p>
<p t="1211680" d="4790">did eat and gave also unto her husband with
her and he did eat.</p>
<p t="1216470" d="2800">";
Women, trouble.</p>
<p t="1219270" d="2320">What's the tree?</p>
<p t="1221590" d="2040">Well we talked about this a little bit before.</p>
<p t="1223630" d="5840">So you say, well if you look at the structure
of experience from this particular perspective</p>
<p t="1229470" d="3750">and you think about that in a horizontal plane,
vertical plane, sorry, with the layers one</p>
<p t="1233220" d="4800">on top of another, then you can imagine the
tree as the thing that unites these three</p>
<p t="1238020" d="1000">layers.</p>
<p t="1239020" d="4750">The tree is the domain that unites chaos and
order and the individual, the structure running</p>
<p t="1243770" d="1490">up through the middle of it.</p>
<p t="1245260" d="4420">And you see a representation of that interestingly
enough, from Norse mythology.</p>
<p t="1249680" d="5860">This is the Yggdrasill the axis mundi the
tree of the gods, the tree that stands in</p>
<p t="1255540" d="2740">the middle of the Norse paradise.</p>
<p t="1258280" d="3120">And one of the things that's very interesting
about this particular tree is that if you</p>
<p t="1261400" d="5170">look at its roots the roots are covered with
snakes and serpents and underneath the snakes</p>
<p t="1266570" d="1650">and serpents is water.</p>
<p t="1268220" d="6760">And so that you see that the tree that stands
at the centre of the world is rooted in chaos</p>
<p t="1274980" d="6160">fundamentally, is rooted in whatever it is
that constitutes the pre-cosmogonic matrix</p>
<p t="1281140" d="1130">of being.</p>
<p t="1282270" d="8410">And then the central aspects of this domain
are nicely laid out as the domain of territoriality,</p>
<p t="1290680" d="4460">the ends of the borders that the individual
understands and the habitual territory that</p>
<p t="1295140" d="5880">he inhabits and then the tree in the centre
represents whatever it is that's central</p>
<p t="1301020" d="3420">to this – to our mode of being.</p>
<p t="1304440" d="5750">And so let's take a look at that in some
detail and flesh it out symbolically.</p>
<p t="1310190" d="7350">We find Eliade is saying the tree that stands
hypothetically at the centre of the world</p>
<p t="1317540" d="5480">is precisely that structure that shamans climb
when they make their transition from normal</p>
<p t="1323020" d="3380">mode of earthly being into their transcendent
mode of being.</p>
<p t="1326400" d="4920">So Eliade says the symbolism of the ascension
into heaven by means of a tree is clearly</p>
<p t="1331320" d="4090">illustrated by the ceremony of initiation
of a Buryat shaman.</p>
<p t="1335410" d="4340">The candidate climbs up a post in the middle
of his yurt, his tent, reaches the summit</p>
<p t="1339750" d="2020">and goes out by the smoke hole.</p>
<p t="1341770" d="4220">But we know that this opening made to let
out the smoke is likened to the hole made</p>
<p t="1345990" d="2500">by the pole star in the bulk of heaven.</p>
<p t="1348490" d="5040">So you can imagine there's a conceptualization
of the world as centred around a particular</p>
<p t="1353530" d="6330">axis and that the tent is regarded as, at
least transitorily as a symbolic equivalent</p>
<p t="1359860" d="3190">of the cosmological structure.</p>
<p t="1363050" d="3680">Among other peoples the tent hole is called
the pillar of the sky and is compared to the</p>
<p t="1366730" d="5340">pole star around which the world rotates,
at least from the visual perspective and is</p>
<p t="1372070" d="1860">named elsewhere the nail of the sky.</p>
<p t="1373930" d="4300">Thus, the ritual post set up in the middle
of the yurt is an image of the cosmic tree</p>
<p t="1378230" d="4030">which is found at the centre of the world
with the pole star shining directly above</p>
<p t="1382260" d="1000">it.</p>
<p t="1383260" d="3260">By ascending it, the candidate enters into
heaven.</p>
<p t="1386520" d="3850">That is why as soon as he comes out of the
smoke hole of the tent he gives a loud cry</p>
<p t="1390370" d="9090">invoking the help of the gods Up there he
finds himself in their presence.</p>
<p t="1399460" d="7020">The tree is an absolutely archaic symbol and
it seems to me most likely that it represents</p>
<p t="1406480" d="1970">the structure of the nervous system.</p>
<p t="1408450" d="5300">I think a structure that's rooted not so
much in the spinal, sensory motor structures</p>
<p t="1413750" d="6670">but deeply in the autonomic structures, stretching
down into the centre of the body and planting</p>
<p t="1420420" d="5560">the mind firmly in its material substrate
so that the autonomic system and its projections</p>
<p t="1425980" d="5280">up into the amigdylla and limbic system and
then up into the cortex constitute the interface</p>
<p t="1431260" d="5100">between the spiritual domain that our psyche
inhabits and the material domain that constitutes</p>
<p t="1436360" d="1130">our body.</p>
<p t="1437490" d="4840">The tree at the centre of our being.</p>
<p t="1442330" d="1000">What does the tree do?</p>
<p t="1443330" d="1570">Well it bears fruit.</p>
<p t="1444900" d="1430">Well what sort of fruit?</p>
<p t="1446330" d="5300">Well there are multiple medieval representations
that are quite peculiar showing Christ, for</p>
<p t="1451630" d="3870">example, as the fruit of the tree of the knowledge
of good and evil.</p>
<p t="1455500" d="1150">The fruit of the tree of life.</p>
<p t="1456650" d="1310">And what does that mean?</p>
<p t="1457960" d="5390">It means that conceptualizations like the
hero are the products of whatever it is that</p>
<p t="1463350" d="2260">this tree represents.</p>
<p t="1465610" d="2500">The tree is something that produces fruit.</p>
<p t="1468110" d="3280">Fruit is also something that can be ingested.</p>
<p t="1471390" d="10800">And as Eric Newman points out wherever liquor,
fruit, herbs, etc. appear as the vehicles</p>
<p t="1482190" d="4940">of life and immortality, including the water
and bread of life, the sacrament of the host</p>
<p t="1487130" d="5100">and every form of food cult down to the present
day we have an ancient mode of human expression</p>
<p t="1492230" d="1120">before us.</p>
<p t="1493350" d="5930">So imagine the idea of the – of the Piagetian
idea of assimilation and then accommodation</p>
<p t="1499280" d="6060">and then understand its assimilative, nutritive,
underlying metaphorical nature.</p>
<p t="1505340" d="5670">The idea being that there's a tight analogy
between ingesting something material and undergoing</p>
<p t="1511010" d="2760">a transformation of energy.</p>
<p t="1513770" d="4430">Attendant upon that, right, which is what
happens when you eat and ingesting a piece</p>
<p t="1518200" d="5380">of information which offers you a new mode
of doing things so you can say well people</p>
<p t="1523580" d="2620">will trade work for information.</p>
<p t="1526200" d="3250">They will trade food for information.</p>
<p t="1529450" d="4500">There must be a kind of equivalence between
work and information and food and information</p>
<p t="1533950" d="2370">because otherwise the trade wouldn't make
sense.</p>
<p t="1536320" d="6010">And then you realize that if you're informed
you can undertake transformations of yourself</p>
<p t="1542330" d="4570">and the material world in a much more efficient
manner because that's what being informed</p>
<p t="1546900" d="1000">means.</p>
<p t="1547900" d="4740">And that means that being informed, acquiring
some information and eating something are</p>
<p t="1552640" d="4340">all tied up in a complex way into the same
metaphorical structure.</p>
<p t="1556980" d="5160">Eat something forbidden, transform as a consequence.</p>
<p t="1562140" d="4900">Conscious realization is acted out in the
elementary scheme of nutritive assimilation</p>
<p t="1567040" d="4610">and a ritual act of concrete eating is the
first assimilation known to man.</p>
<p t="1571650" d="1000">Conscious realization is acted out through
ritual by an act of eating.</p>
<p t="1572650" d="1000">Since the act of eating represents a very
familiar example of assimilation.</p>
<p t="1573650" d="5430">The assimilation and ingestion of the content,
the eaten food, produces an inner change.</p>
<p t="1579080" d="3970">Transformation of the body cell through food
intake is the most elementary of animal changes</p>
<p t="1583050" d="2630">experienced by man.</p>
<p t="1585680" d="5010">How a weary, enfeebled and famished man can
be turned into an alert, strong and satisfied</p>
<p t="1590690" d="5190">being or a man perishing of thirst can be
refreshed or even transformed by an intoxicating</p>
<p t="1595880" d="1000">drink.</p>
<p t="1596880" d="5300">This is and must remain a fundamental experience
so long a man shall exist.</p>
<p t="1602180" d="7620">Eric Newman's point being that our psychological
experience of the capacity of psychological</p>
<p t="1609800" d="6370">transformation through eating is a metaphor
waiting to be applied to the equivalent experience</p>
<p t="1616170" d="4760">that we obtain, the equivalent excitement
and sense of transformative possibility that</p>
<p t="1620930" d="6580">we acquire as a consequence of coming across
some new and truly valuable piece of information.</p>
<p t="1627510" d="5000">So you have the idea that the tree that stands
at the centre of the world, the individual</p>
<p t="1632510" d="3210">mode of being, is something that bears fruit.</p>
<p t="1635720" d="4910">And the ingestion of that fruit, that idea
say or that piece of information is something</p>
<p t="1640630" d="2910">that can produce a permanent transformation.</p>
