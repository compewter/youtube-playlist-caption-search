<p t="159" d="7430">Hi there. This is my message to Millennials about how to change the world and I would say how to change the world properly</p>
<p t="8200" d="5240">[of] course the question, then is well exactly what do you mean by properly and of course that's the fundamental issue</p>
<p t="13440" d="2159">So I'm going to walk through that little bit</p>
<p t="15599" d="6540">So I'm gonna and I've also got an offer to make to any millennials that are willing to watch this so</p>
<p t="23199" d="7580">This was triggered in [part] by something I read recently by Jonathan hate and Jonathan haidt is the professor of ethical leadership at the nyu</p>
<p t="31119" d="2479">Stern school of business, and he's been a very astute</p>
<p t="34180" d="4160">Commentator recently on some of the political battles that have been going on in the social sciences</p>
<p t="39250" d="6169">[noting] for example that there is very little political diversity in the views of social scientists and perhaps even less on</p>
<p t="45520" d="2000">the part of the people in the humanities</p>
<p t="48160" d="6619">And hate recently wrote something which all all what are you linked to in the and the description of this video?</p>
<p t="55840" d="6979">Where he claimed that universities have to decide between Social justice and truth and on the side of truth he puts</p>
<p t="63219" d="3469">Philosopher call named John Stuart Mill an English Philosopher who said</p>
<p t="67330" d="3739">He who knows only his side of the case knows little of that</p>
<p t="71710" d="3139">His reasons may be good and no one may have been able to refute them</p>
<p t="74850" d="4529">But if he is equally unable to refute the reasons on the opposite side if he does not</p>
<p t="79990" d="4340">Does not so much as know what they are he has no ground for preferring either opinion</p>
<p t="84330" d="1719">And then he juxtaposes</p>
<p t="86049" d="6500">John Stuart Mill with Karl Marx who said the Philosopher's have only interpreted the world in various ways the point is to [change] it</p>
<p t="92670" d="3569">He considers Marx the Patron Saint of Social justice</p>
<p t="96970" d="4969">University which is oriented around changing the world in part by overthrowing power structures and privilege</p>
<p t="102579" d="3230">It sees political diversity as an obstacle to action</p>
<p t="106360" d="5809">male on the other hand according to hate is the Patron saint [of] what he calls truth you which sees truth as a</p>
<p t="112270" d="7190">Process in which flawed individuals challenge each other's biased and incomplete reasoning and in the process all become smarter</p>
<p t="119920" d="5150">Hate points out the truth university dies when it becomes intellectually uniform or politically, orthodox</p>
<p t="125320" d="7129">So I guess this video is in part my call along with Jonathan haidt for young people to join</p>
<p t="132819" d="6050">Truth universe versity, but there's a problem with that because the university is where the truth is being sought</p>
<p t="138870" d="2130">That's the university, but there's a problem</p>
<p t="141000" d="3930">and that is that young people want to change the world and it's part of what Piaget the</p>
<p t="145150" d="7280">developmental psychologist piaget called the Messianic stage and there's some real utility in that because we're social creatures and</p>
<p t="153310" d="6980">As we construct ourselves and formulate ourselves and bring our own character into being predicated on our on our</p>
<p t="160930" d="1980">biological</p>
<p t="162910" d="3500">Platform our biological being we also simultaneously have to integrate</p>
<p t="166780" d="4760">Adjust to integrate with and negotiate with Society which sometimes needs to be changed</p>
<p t="172000" d="2119">The structure of [Society] has to be preserved</p>
<p t="174370" d="5000">But it has to be [updated] and proved as it moves forward and so part of the problem is how to update and improve it</p>
<p t="179370" d="1270">without</p>
<p t="180640" d="3620">doing [that] so rapidly that you destroy everything of any value, so</p>
<p t="184840" d="4339">The problem I have with the marxist perspective, and I've had this problem with it for a long time</p>
<p t="189180" d="3390">Is that I don't think [that] you should trust people whose primary goal?</p>
<p t="193480" d="1050">when when</p>
<p t="194530" d="5630">when they're attempting to change the world for the better is to change other people and you can tell who those people are because they're</p>
<p t="200160" d="5369">always blaming other people and they're looking for victims they're looking for perpetrators and victims and then they're going off to stop the</p>
<p t="205660" d="2539">perpetrators, and I think that's wrong because as</p>
<p t="208720" d="4130">Alexander solzhenitsyn said he's a great Russian writer who helped bring down the soviet union</p>
<p t="212850" d="4319">He said the line between good and Evil runs down every every [humans] heart</p>
<p t="217360" d="2779">So that so the real battle as far as I'm concerned</p>
<p t="220140" d="5220">And I think this goes along with the true tradition in [which] John stuart mill is is firmly placed in is that?</p>
<p t="225940" d="2690">to overcome Tyranny and malevolence and</p>
<p t="229300" d="6229">Chaos and Nihilism and the Desire to bring everything to a halt you have to repair the fissures</p>
<p t="236170" d="4279">And-And-and the rift that's in your own soul, basically and that means that you have to confront</p>
<p t="240970" d="2239">the the Evil that lives in your own heart</p>
<p t="243209" d="6029">and there's a there's a statement from the new testament [that] I think is very much apropos with regards to this particular idea and</p>
<p t="249640" d="1440">this is</p>
<p t="251080" d="5810">This is part of the sermon on the mount which is a central text in in western in the western tradition</p>
<p t="256890" d="7619">I would say [obviously] central to Christianity but central to everything that western civilization has built and so christ says to his followers</p>
<p t="265510" d="2000">Why be holdest thou?</p>
<p t="267510" d="5640">the mote that is in thy brother's eye, but considerest not the beam that is in thine own eye or</p>
<p t="273790" d="6589">How wilt thou say to thy brother let me pull out the mote out of thine eye and behold a beam is in [thine] own</p>
<p t="280380" d="4470">eye thou hypocrite first cast out [the] beam out of thine own eye and then</p>
<p t="285310" d="3650">Shalt thou see clearly to cast the mote out of thy brother's eye</p>
<p t="289600" d="3140">Well, I like that quote because it places the responsibility</p>
<p t="293290" d="6829">For change at every level of being on the individual and obviously the individual interacts with society</p>
<p t="300120" d="4380">But the idea here is that unless the individual straightens out his or her [own] soul</p>
<p t="304840" d="6740">There's no possibility that the impact the individual can have on society can be anything, but [buts] a harmful in proportion to the harm</p>
<p t="311580" d="4289">That's still in the soul. These are important [things] to know they're vitally important things to know</p>
<p t="316450" d="5000">So okay, so but then we're faced with the conundrum that young people also want to change the world</p>
<p t="321450" d="5549">but that's no problem because I [think] you can bring you could bring truth university together with the desire to</p>
<p t="327160" d="2000">to make real change, but change</p>
<p t="329680" d="2330">Change change has to start [at] the right place</p>
<p t="332010" d="4799">so I'm going to tell you how I [think] you should change yourself so that you can change the world and</p>
<p t="337180" d="3500">So that the world that you bring into being will be a better world and all the worst one</p>
<p t="340930" d="6320">Remember remember you need to know about this that the world that the followers of Marx brought into being in the 20th century</p>
<p t="347320" d="6919">Killed more than a hundred million people say in China and russia. [I] mean the soviet Union and [in] places like Cambodia and Vietnam</p>
<p t="354790" d="3079">The world certainly changed as a consequence of Marxist doctrine</p>
<p t="357870" d="3780">But it didn't [change] in in a good direction and of course the Marxist doctrine is</p>
<p t="361870" d="5420">Making itself heard in a massive way across the west again now so all right</p>
<p t="367290" d="3329">So what should you do about that? Well? Here's an idea?</p>
<p t="371620" d="2780">The first thing you have to do is orient yourself now</p>
<p t="374400" d="7799">You probably have all watched pinocchio and pinocchio is about how a marionette someone who's whose strings are being pulled by Forces Beyond his comprehension</p>
<p t="382600" d="3079">[that's] the situation of the undeveloped individual</p>
<p t="386200" d="2539">Geppetto who's a Benevolent father so a benevolent?</p>
<p t="389650" d="4009">Symbol a symbol of benevolent culture makes a puppet his son</p>
<p t="393660" d="6269">and then wishes on a star now a star is something that glitters up in the sky and it's and it's associated with the</p>
<p t="400210" d="3599">Transcendent and Beyond and the divine and you know if you look up in the night, [sky]</p>
<p t="403810" d="4139">And it's very dark [you] get a feeling of awe it's because you're confronting your soul</p>
<p t="407949" d="5790">so to speak your individual soul is confronting the cosmos and you can feel a relationship between you and and and</p>
<p t="413930" d="5929">and the totality so looking up into the sky is like a religious experience if it's a starry sky and</p>
<p t="419930" d="4880">to wish upon a star is to find in a light that orient's you like the North star and</p>
<p t="424970" d="2659">To pick a highest goal to pick the highest goal</p>
<p t="427629" d="4290">You can conceive of and so that's what geppetto does he raises his eyes above his</p>
<p t="432169" d="5570">his Day-To-day concerns and tries to establish a relationship with the highest of all possible values and</p>
<p t="438319" d="6710">And and he has the most profound of wishes and the most profound of wishes is that the puppet that he's created</p>
<p t="445219" d="6770">Could become a genuine individual genuinely fully fully developed human being and that's what you can wish for [yourself]</p>
<p t="452180" d="3470">That's you can wish and and and and aim for that in yourself</p>
<p t="455659" d="750">and then</p>
<p t="456409" d="6500">You see that's how you deal [with] the suffering that's attendant on life because life is suffering and because life is very hard and people</p>
<p t="462909" d="4650">Get sick, and they become mentally ill and and and there's malevolence in the world</p>
<p t="467560" d="2279">And there's tragedy and so life is very very hard</p>
<p t="469840" d="729">and if</p>
<p t="470569" d="6649">you're not properly oriented with regards to life the fact that it's hard and the fact that it's full of suffering can can warp and</p>
<p t="477219" d="3450">twist and Bend you until you become murderous and resentful and and</p>
<p t="480889" d="6170">even go Beyond murderous and resentment to wish for for genocide and evil even to wish for [the] destruction of everything and</p>
<p t="487279" d="4820">So you have to learn [how] to strengthen yourself as an individual [so] that you can bear?</p>
<p t="492319" d="600">the</p>
<p t="492919" d="5959">Burden of being without becoming corrupt you have to decide that that is what you're aiming [for] is that you want to become [a] fully</p>
<p t="498879" d="2000">developed human being and stop being a</p>
<p t="501319" d="3800">Pathetic Marionette whose strings are being pulled by Horrible Forces behind the scenes</p>
<p t="505909" d="5000">So I would say to wish on a stars to Aim at the highest good in the question, then is well</p>
<p t="510909" d="1690">What what is the good?</p>
<p t="512599" d="1050">well</p>
<p t="513649" d="1520">We can answer that in two ways</p>
<p t="515169" d="3000">We could say that the good is the opposite of evil</p>
<p t="518169" d="2000">And I can tell you what evil is evil</p>
<p t="520370" d="6289">is the conscious desire to produce suffering where suffering is not necessary and so if you read about</p>
<p t="527000" d="1829">What happened in the NaZi Concentration?</p>
<p t="528829" d="5090">camps for example or in the in the Russian concentration camps during the soviet time of the soviet union</p>
<p t="533920" d="6420">you'll get a good flow favor for what constitutes evil and evil is the desire to exploit the vulnerability of other people to</p>
<p t="540620" d="1380">self-consciously exploit the</p>
<p t="542000" d="6529">Vulnerability of other people and to elevate their suffering beyond their or anyone's ability to tolerate and so the good is the opposite of that</p>
<p t="548530" d="5040">Whatever the opposite of that is the good is harder to get a handle on but here's one hint</p>
<p t="553570" d="4109">and I got this from reading jean Piaget partly who's a developmental pSychologist and</p>
<p t="558890" d="1830">Piaget talked about the</p>
<p t="560720" d="3350">Equilibrated state and in equilibrated state is like a game the children play</p>
<p t="564380" d="3589">Where every child wants to play the game you have a little social group?</p>
<p t="567970" d="6270">And that's the children's play group and any of us the individuals within it those are the individual children and the structure is the game</p>
<p t="574820" d="2869">and it's a good game if everyone wants to play it and</p>
<p t="578240" d="7399">And piaget noted that a game like that will outperform a game that people have to be terrorized to play because it doesn't entail it</p>
<p t="585640" d="7500">doesn't require any enforcement cost and so I've sort of developed the idea of [nil] equilibrated state to think that if</p>
<p t="593420" d="3619">If you're aiming at the good, then you want what's good for you?</p>
<p t="597250" d="3899">And I mean good [for] you as if you were taking care of yourself, and we're good to yourself</p>
<p t="601150" d="2000">We were treating yourself like someone you loved</p>
<p t="603440" d="5029">That was good for you in a way that [would] also be good for your family, and then it would be good for you</p>
<p t="608470" d="4409">And your family in a way that was also good for society and then it would be</p>
<p t="613100" d="4190">Good for you, and your family and society in a way that would [be] good for the world</p>
<p t="617810" d="1640">And then it would be good now</p>
<p t="619450" d="5670">And it would be good next week and the week after and a year from now and is long into the future [as] you can</p>
<p t="625120" d="6539">See, so the good is something that's equilibrate across multiple levels of being in multiple time frames simultaneously</p>
<p t="631660" d="5340">And it isn't necessarily that you know what that is going to be at any given moment, but you can orient yourself</p>
<p t="637000" d="2909">So that's the state that you [want] to exist in and I can tell you</p>
<p t="640400" d="3170">As far [as] I [can] tell when you exist in that state</p>
<p t="644480" d="1770">even moment by Moment</p>
<p t="646250" d="4639">Your life is imbued with a sense of meaning and that sense of meaning can help you transcend</p>
<p t="651230" d="3409">Suffering the Philosopher Nietzsche said he who has a why</p>
<p t="655490" d="2630">Can Bear [anyhow] he who has a why?</p>
<p t="658490" d="6349">Can bear [anyhow] and so Nietzsche's idea was that if there was purpose in your life of sufficient grandeur that?</p>
<p t="665690" d="2299">not only could the suffering in life be a</p>
<p t="668900" d="2000">but maybe it even be</p>
<p t="671030" d="4760">appreciated like it could be that you're willing to bear the burden of being because of</p>
<p t="676040" d="660">the</p>
<p t="676700" d="5630">Exciting things that you can do with being the things you can build and the things that you can bring about and that might be</p>
<p t="682330" d="6390">The highest imaginable state of being and that's that's a form of paradise, but it's not a paradise that you attain by transforming others</p>
<p t="688720" d="3299">It's a paradise that you attain by transforming yourself</p>
<p t="692020" d="730">and</p>
<p t="692750" d="4730">That's a very difficult thing to do and it's a very frightening thing to do because it means that you're you're</p>
<p t="697610" d="3380">Retooling your soul, and that's that's a job for a real</p>
<p t="701690" d="4820">That's the job for a forthright and honorable person and it's an exciting enough</p>
<p t="706510" d="2250">Task so that it will keep you occupied for the rest of your life</p>
<p t="708760" d="2100">and then magical things will happen to you well your</p>
<p t="710930" d="5269">While you're doing it, and the world will arrange itself around you in the most wonderful way in a musical way</p>
<p t="716270" d="3440">So that every part of what you're experiencing plays off</p>
<p t="720260" d="3080">against every other part in a manner that has meaning</p>
<p t="723710" d="5239">embedded in every aspect of it and you experience that by the way you experience that when you listen to a piece of [music] that</p>
<p t="728950" d="3239">You love music represents that and that's why people it's why music</p>
<p t="732860" d="5719">Nourishes the soul why it's the highest form of art at least in my opinion. So you have to live your life as if</p>
<p t="739100" d="4489">Being is a symphony, and you're playing you're playing your instrumental part</p>
<p t="767840" d="2899">Once you are it yourself. Then you have an [obligation]</p>
<p t="770740" d="5070">I would say an obligation to the development of your soul to speak the truth you have to be oriented properly though</p>
<p t="775810" d="1870">Because the truth is is something that</p>
<p t="777680" d="5780">Exists in service to an ideal an ideal of sorts then you can imagine that you could use your [language] two ways you can use</p>
<p t="783460" d="2000">your language to manipulate the world and</p>
<p t="785750" d="2840">To extract from it what you want, so for example</p>
<p t="788590" d="4019">Maybe you go out on a date with someone and you decide that the end goal of the date is to</p>
<p t="792740" d="3800">Have a sexual partner for the night and then you can craft your language to manipulate</p>
<p t="796610" d="5180">The person into providing you with you with what you want, and that's like an instrumental use of language</p>
<p t="802220" d="3109">But the problem with [that]. There's many problems with that</p>
<p t="805330" d="4619">But one of them is is that what if your idea about what you should want is wrong like maybe that's not the way to</p>
<p t="809950" d="4559">treat someone that you're on a date with out on a date with maybe maybe you're</p>
<p t="815180" d="2929">minimizing and reducing the interactions between you</p>
<p t="818900" d="3109">from what could be a healthy and</p>
<p t="822710" d="3440">Elevated state of interaction and discourse to something that's that</p>
<p t="826880" d="4669">Basically the pursuit of impulsive pleasure and not maybe that's not good for you</p>
<p t="831770" d="5659">Next week and the week after and a month down the road maybe orienting yourself towards impulsive pleasure is a very bad idea</p>
<p t="837890" d="6530">Remember what happens in Pinocchio pinocchio goes to pleasure island and pleasure island is a place where impulsive pleasures can be had</p>
<p t="844880" d="5780">at a moment's notice but what pinocchio discovers along with Jiminy cricket that pleasure island is run by</p>
<p t="851570" d="1620">masked</p>
<p t="853190" d="5030">Totalitarians there they're all dressed in black you remember. They're there turning the children and</p>
<p t="858740" d="1710">Adolescents who are on Pleasure Island?</p>
<p t="860450" d="2809">They're depriving about their voice turning them into brain</p>
<p t="863540" d="5389">Jackasses and preparing to sell them as slaves to the salt mines and so there's an implication in that story that</p>
<p t="869150" d="2029">the pursuit of Impulse of pleasure is</p>
<p t="871700" d="4580">One route to totalitarianism and slavery, and I believe that so perhaps</p>
<p t="876860" d="6739">Orienting your language towards the gathering of the impulsive pleasure is a miss is a misuse of your highest gift</p>
<p t="883600" d="2550">You're the gift of logos the gift of communication</p>
<p t="886400" d="1740">The alternative is to orient</p>
<p t="888140" d="5390">Yourself towards the highest good as we already described and then speak the truth which and you can you can tell when you're doing that?</p>
<p t="893530" d="5279">because or you can tell when you're not doing that because if you're if you're not telling the truth if you're using someone else's words</p>
<p t="898810" d="1340">You're being</p>
<p t="900150" d="4710">Elated into sense by forces that are behind the scenes. You're not using your own words</p>
<p t="905080" d="5539">You're the puppet of an ideology or another thinker or your own impulsive desires</p>
<p t="910620" d="3240">And you can tell when you're speaking like that because it makes you feel weak</p>
<p t="913860" d="3029">It makes you feel weak and ashamed and you can localize that feeling</p>
<p t="917530" d="2000">physiologically if you listen to yourself talk</p>
<p t="919900" d="1830">you can tell when</p>
<p t="921730" d="1320">when you're speaking</p>
<p t="923050" d="6889">Properly you will experience a feeling of integration and strength and when you're speaking in a deceitful or manipulative Manner</p>
<p t="929940" d="4740">You'll feel that you're starting to come apart at the seams and what you need to do is practice</p>
<p t="934870" d="4220">Only saying things that make you feel stronger, and that'll mean to begin with it</p>
<p t="939090" d="4140">You'll notice that almost everything you say is a lie. It's either a lie or someone else's words</p>
<p t="943300" d="4549">It's very hard to find your [old] words, but you don't actually exist until you have your own words</p>
<p t="948520" d="4940">So okay, so then you you try to teach yourself how to speak your own truth</p>
<p t="953460" d="5220">And you listen to other people while you're doing that because they can help you shape and correct your words</p>
<p t="959470" d="2270">They'll react to them badly if you formulate your ideas</p>
<p t="961960" d="3229">Badly and if you listen and pay attention then you can learn to formulate your words</p>
<p t="965350" d="3409">More and more clearly and accurately and that makes you more and more powerful</p>
<p t="968760" d="6330">It makes you it gives you more and more authority which is the which is the beneficial form of power, okay?</p>
<p t="975090" d="3090">So you do that, and then you have to make a decision of Faith</p>
<p t="978180" d="5489">And that's basically well that you can either either use [your] language to manipulate the world and make it do what you want</p>
<p t="984190" d="5780">or you can use your language to try to articulate the truth as carefully as you possibly can and then</p>
<p t="991060" d="3230">[you] can see what happens you have to let go of your desire</p>
<p t="994750" d="4430">For the for the consequences that you want you have to assume that if you speak the [truth]</p>
<p t="999700" d="2690">The results are the best that is possible under the circumstances</p>
<p t="1002730" d="4429">[and] so it's a it's a it's an exciting way of living in some sense some sense</p>
<p t="1007160" d="5969">It's like continually walking off a cliff because you don't know what's going to happen next [if] all you do is say what you think?</p>
<p t="1013200" d="3619">You know and maybe you're at work, and you say what you [think] and you get fired you think oh my God?</p>
<p t="1016820" d="6929">That's a terrible catastrophe, but maybe it's not because maybe if you're working somewhere, and you have to lie to maintain your job</p>
<p t="1023750" d="1050">Maybe you shouldn't be there</p>
<p t="1024800" d="5939">Maybe it's deadening your soul and damaging you in some permanent manner and making you corrupt and so</p>
<p t="1031140" d="2750">You have to orient yourself you have to speak the truth</p>
<p t="1034070" d="5849">as carefully as you can you have to listen to others so that you correct your speech and then you have to allow the</p>
<p t="1040350" d="4340">Consequences that ensue to unfold as they will that's the ultimate act of Faith</p>
<p t="1044690" d="3000">I would say and that's what you do if you belong to truth university</p>
<p t="1048030" d="4130">All right, so more practically speaking then you should educate yourself</p>
<p t="1052160" d="2250">and it's not that easy to do now because</p>
<p t="1054750" d="5630">You have to find people who can [actually] tell you mostly what to read and maybe also how to write because writing is a way</p>
<p t="1060380" d="2520">Of formulating your thoughts ever more precisely</p>
<p t="1062900" d="4650">that's why you go to university to learn how to write if you learn if you know how to write you can think if</p>
<p t="1067770" d="4400">You can think and speak and communicate in writing? You're you're unbelievably?</p>
<p t="1073020" d="2900">powerful in the Authority Manner because</p>
<p t="1076830" d="4700">arguments move the world Forward and if your arguments are tight and [well-constructed] and</p>
<p t="1081990" d="4969">Lucid and well edited and carefully thought through and you have five rationales for everything that you're doing</p>
<p t="1087210" d="4040">Which is what happens if you learn to write properly, then you're like a force of nature man</p>
<p t="1091290" d="1250">No one can take you down</p>
<p t="1092540" d="4589">And that's one of the things that people aren't taught about why you go get educated especially in the humanities</p>
<p t="1098340" d="2000">humanities education if it's real</p>
<p t="1100950" d="1560">organizes your pSyChe</p>
<p t="1102510" d="1980">grounds you puts you on a</p>

<p t="1110840" d="2640">They're the great people of the past in [my] list</p>
<p t="1113640" d="2989">they're the great men of the past and that's just how it is and</p>
<p t="1116790" d="3559">So here's who I would recommend I put reading lists up at Jordan B</p>
<p t="1120360" d="3830">Peterson Com there's two of them and the people that I recommend</p>
<p t="1124920" d="3679">Primarily are their books written by the followed list of people Fyodor [dostoyevsky]</p>
<p t="1129180" d="3679">Leo Tolstoy, who I think perhaps the greatest novelists the world has ever seen</p>
<p t="1133500" d="6949">Alexander solzhenitsyn another great russian novelist. I don't know what it is about the russians, but man they produce they produce writers that are</p>
<p t="1141150" d="3229">incomparable Alexander solzhenitsyn wrote a book called [the] gulag archipelago</p>
<p t="1144950" d="7260">where he analyzed the soviet prison Camp system that arose after the leninist revolution in the second decade of the 20th century and</p>
<p t="1152670" d="2390">details [an] absolutely precisely how the</p>
<p t="1155940" d="6319">[tenets] of Marxism the Marxist tenants that are supposed to free everyone and change the world produce legislation</p>
<p t="1162360" d="4400">[that] was that was absolutely murderous in its consequences and solzhenitsyn</p>
<p t="1167970" d="7400">Painstakingly traces the logical Pathway from the original Marxist principles to the legislation to the to the genocides</p>
<p t="1175800" d="5300">because you'll hear people who are basically marxist to say things like well true Marxism never existed and</p>
<p t="1181410" d="7700">Solzhenitsyn took that bad argument apart in the in the [mid-70s] and and the gulag archipelago was an intellectual bomb it it</p>
<p t="1189330" d="870">it</p>
<p t="1190200" d="1080">demolished any</p>
<p t="1191280" d="3860">Credibility that Marxism had to intellectual respectability you have to read the book</p>
<p t="1195210" d="5359">The book is about the central issue in our culture at the moment if you don't read it. You're not informed</p>
<p t="1200570" d="4199">You can't participate in the debate except as a puppet and so I wouldn't recommend</p>
<p t="1205500" d="5989">Participating in this debate as a puppet because you don't know who's behind the scenes pulling the strings if you remember the pinocchio story</p>
<p t="1211650" d="2240">The forces that we're pulling the strings were not</p>
<p t="1214860" d="2359">They were not forces that were acting in Pinocchio's</p>
<p t="1217220" d="5459">best interest that's for sure George orwell English essayist incomparable commentator on</p>
<p t="1223050" d="5479">Socialist totalitarianism even though he was a left winger and a Brilliant one aldous Huxley wrote brave New world</p>
<p t="1228840" d="2780">Had some very brilliant things to say about the potential</p>
<p t="1231690" d="6410">demolition of sexual choice of choice of sexual partner as a part of part of a you dystopian future Friedrich Nietzsche a</p>
<p t="1239010" d="2359">Philosopher who described himself as as</p>
<p t="1242400" d="7280">Someone who thought with a hammer and Nietzsche is a very very dangerous person and an absolutely Brilliant writer and [Carl] jung who?</p>
<p t="1250320" d="5420">Was a student of Nietzsche and who Nietzsche was the philosopher who announced the death of God back in the late?</p>
<p t="1255960" d="2000">1800s and jung spent his whole life</p>
<p t="1258150" d="6560">Attempting to revivify God that's one way of thinking about it, and so if you or educate yourself</p>
<p t="1264710" d="4199">And this is [a] really good place to start if you read these authors then you'll know what else to read if you read these</p>
<p t="1268910" d="3660">authors it'll it'll take you a good long time and it will be very very hard on you and and</p>
<p t="1273030" d="2000">You won't be the same person when you come out?</p>
<p t="1275030" d="5790">And that's very frightening and because being torn down and rebuilt his note is no joke</p>
<p t="1280820" d="5190">But it beats the hell out [of] the alternative which is just to stagnate and stay as stagnant infant</p>
<p t="1286110" d="3829">Which is which is not something. I recommend there's nothing uglier than a</p>
<p t="1290640" d="2119">stagnant 40 year old infant</p>
<p t="1293580" d="3829">So that's equivalent. Just so you know - pinocchio back to the pinocchio story</p>
<p t="1297690" d="5589">rescuing geppetto from the underworld remember and he was he had kind of turned into a half jackass after being at the</p>
<p t="1303860" d="6410">Pleasure Island where he was enticed by the way from a couple of people who that was the fox and the cat who attempted to?</p>
<p t="1310520" d="3739">entice himself into believing that he [was] a victim and needed a vacation, so</p>
<p t="1314809" d="5660">pinocchio was enticed [onto] pleasure island by two two figures that played on his sense of</p>
<p t="1320630" d="4609">Victimization and neuroses and suffering to convince him that he didn't have to he didn't have to take any</p>
<p t="1325520" d="1159">[responsibility] for his own existence</p>
<p t="1326679" d="6330">And he could just busy himself with impulsive pleasures right that's how he fell into the hands of the totalitarian, so on Pleasure Island</p>
<p t="1334910" d="2329">Anyways, Pinocchio after he left?</p>
<p t="1337760" d="5660">Pleasure Island had to go into the ocean twice and the second time [he] went into the ocean he was looking for his father well</p>
<p t="1344210" d="5719">everyone's father from a mythological perspective is dying in the underworld in the Chaos because</p>
<p t="1350540" d="2209">everyone inhabits a culture</p>
<p t="1352750" d="4199">that's that's sick and old so to speak and it's sick [and] old because it was made by the dead and</p>
<p t="1357050" d="3379">the living have to revivify it continually in order for it to be a</p>

<p t="1365570" d="4220">Constructions of culture although not only constructions of culture and you have to understand history</p>
<p t="1370340" d="2119">Because otherwise you can't understand yourself</p>
<p t="1372460" d="1050">You're a historical creature</p>
<p t="1373510" d="4500">And so you have to rescue your dead father from the belly of the beast from the dragon</p>
<p t="1378110" d="2930">Guests remember the whale in pinocchio is also a fire-breathing dragon</p>
<p t="1381050" d="6889">[and] that means you have to face the thing that you most fear and when you do that, you'll rescue your father from the underworld</p>

<p t="1393910" d="4380">I put a free copy of it on Jordan B. Peterson [Com] so you can download it</p>
<p t="1398290" d="6539">I take apart these sorts of things in detail. So anyways you have to revivify your father before you can become real and</p>
<p t="1405350" d="2000">that's part of the problem with the</p>
<p t="1407570" d="5660">The [feminists] in feminist and Social Justice warrior insistence on the existence of the patriarchy it's like</p>
<p t="1413690" d="3739">Everyone's known since the beginning of time that culture is corrupt and tyrannical</p>
<p t="1417429" d="6750">But it's also protective and benevolent even the language used is a product of culture and so you don't overthrow the patriarchy</p>
<p t="1424370" d="3530">Yuri vivify your culture and you do that by adopting</p>
<p t="1428330" d="5060">Responsibility for your own being and then acting as a moral agent in the culture, that's what you do</p>

<p t="1439090" d="6720">They'll take you apart. They'll devastate you and then they'll rebuild you into something far greater than you are now [you're] [hurt]</p>

<p t="1503930" d="2000">it's alright today and</p>
<p t="1506510" d="1830">That's what to aim for</p>
<p t="1508340" d="3109">So then and here's something that will help you my colleagues</p>
<p t="1511450" d="4049">And I have developed a series of online writing programs called the self authoring suite</p>
<p t="1515500" d="4440">And they help people write about their past and organize that and their present</p>
<p t="1520190" d="6500">Personality and organize and understand that and then the future and the future authoring program asks you to write about</p>
<p t="1526970" d="2000">six different dimensions of your life</p>
<p t="1529700" d="3859">so it asks you first of all treat yourself as if you're someone that you want to help and</p>
<p t="1533900" d="3589">Lend that someone that you love and take care of and someone that you want to help and then</p>
<p t="1537680" d="6109">It asks you well if you could if you [could] organize your life in the best possible Manner and in keeping with those principles</p>
<p t="1543790" d="2000">We discussed earlier um</p>
<p t="1545960" d="5659">What do you want? What? Do you want for your career like what do you want? What would make your life meaningful?</p>
<p t="1551620" d="3540">What do you want for your career? What do you want for your family and from your family?</p>
<p t="1555160" d="2000">What do you want for an intimate relationship?</p>
<p t="1557480" d="3440">How are you going to handle how are you going to take care of your mental and physical health?</p>
<p t="1560920" d="5040">How are you going to handle drug drug and alcohol use it asks you a series [of] fundamental questions like that</p>
<p t="1566090" d="5479">To get your mind moving, and then it asks you to write for 15 minutes about what your life could be [like]</p>
<p t="1571970" d="2090">fifty three to five years in the future if</p>
<p t="1574130" d="4010">it was laid out like you were laying out a life for someone you deeply cared about and</p>
<p t="1578300" d="5479">so you're asked to write for 15 minutes about that without worrying too much about structure the structure of the [argument] or</p>
<p t="1584210" d="6109">Any grammatical niceties that [that's] put off for later, so that gives you a little heaven dame for right?</p>
<p t="1590320" d="570">It's like well</p>
<p t="1590890" d="4950">If I could have this my life would be clearly worthwhile even if I had to put up with a fair bit of suffering along</p>
<p t="1595840" d="4619">the way that's what you're trying to construct and you can think about that as a heaven worth moving towards and</p>
<p t="1600620" d="2989">then the second part of the program asks you to write about</p>
<p t="1604310" d="5510">what your life would be like three to five years down the road if all of your bad habits and nihilistic tendencies and</p>
<p t="1610760" d="3200">proclivity towards resentment and lack of Desire to shoulder responsibility</p>
<p t="1614180" d="4069">if all your weak points got the upper hand and just ordered you into the ground and</p>
<p t="1618620" d="5210">Everyone knows that you know what you'd be like if you just let everything slide and and you know what particular hell</p>
<p t="1623830" d="4559">You were ended up heading towards and so the set the second part of the program asks you to write about</p>
<p t="1628910" d="5150">What your life would be like three to five years down the road if everything just went to hell around you and so that gives?</p>
<p t="1634060" d="2000">you a hell to avoid and heaven to strive for</p>
<p t="1636820" d="3119">You need both of those because that's what keeps you properly motivated in life</p>
<p t="1639940" d="3750">And then the second half of the program that the next part of the program</p>
<p t="1644150" d="5390">helps you turn your vision of the desirable future into an implementable reality and to</p>
<p t="1649850" d="6739">Articulate it fully and to articulate the arguments for why you want that and those even help you overcome your own doubts, right?</p>
<p t="1656590" d="1710">It's not only to argue against other people</p>
<p t="1658300" d="5189">It's to argue against the chattering Demons of Nihilism and hopelessness and ideological</p>
<p t="1663830" d="2539">possession that that exists in your mind and in society</p>
<p t="1666890" d="5030">Simultaneously you need powerful weapons to fight back against those so here's an offer for you</p>
<p t="1671960" d="4549">We've made the future authoring program available free for the next while</p>
<p t="1676510" d="3989">I don't know how long a while be but let's assume a week or something like that and</p>
<p t="1681050" d="2000">so if you go to</p>
