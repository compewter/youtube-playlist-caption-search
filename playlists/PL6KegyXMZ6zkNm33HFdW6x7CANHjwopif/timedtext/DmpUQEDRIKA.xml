<p t="7410" d="3890">So I want to talk about some more attributes
of this structure.</p>
<p t="11300" d="7110">Okay, now, broadly speaking what we’re going
to say is that a motivation sets up one of</p>
<p t="18410" d="1000">these frameworks.</p>
<p t="19410" d="3280">I’m going to call this framework a story.</p>
<p t="22690" d="2650">Now there’s lots of things you could call
it.</p>
<p t="25340" d="4580">You could call it an expectancy model, you
could call it a game; I’m going to call</p>
<p t="29920" d="4500">it a story and we’re going to say well what
you do is you have a life story and your life</p>
<p t="34420" d="3060">story is composed of nested sub-stories.</p>
<p t="37480" d="3899">You could also think of it as a personality,
but a story is like a personality in action.</p>
<p t="41379" d="2541">So, we’ll just stick with story.</p>
<p t="43920" d="4299">The story has a starting place, that’s where
you are, and the story has an endpoint, that’s</p>
<p t="48219" d="1000">where you’re going.</p>
<p t="49219" d="3331">And you’re always in one of those stories,
or you’re asleep.</p>
<p t="52550" d="7020">So, you’re either pursuing something in
the real world that is of value, that’s</p>
<p t="59570" d="4919">directly motivated, or you’re pursuing another
situation where the reason you’re pursing</p>
<p t="64489" d="3901">it is because it fulfills a bunch of motivational
states now and into the future.</p>
<p t="68390" d="3120">So that ‘s what you’re doing when you
pursue, say a career.</p>
<p t="71510" d="5790">And, if you’re not doing that, then your
mind is wandering and what it’s doing is</p>
<p t="77300" d="6140">it’s wandering through the space of hypothetical
worlds where you can play hypothetical roles.</p>
<p t="83440" d="2170">And if you’re not doing that then you’re
asleep.</p>
<p t="85610" d="2360">So you’re in one of these all the time.</p>
<p t="87970" d="4310">Now they shift, and that’s one of the things
that’s quite interesting about them.</p>
<p t="92280" d="3590">The shift can take place on all sorts of levels.</p>
<p t="95870" d="4090">You can differently conceptualize the way,
where you are.</p>
<p t="99960" d="3749">You can differently conceptualize where you’re
going, and you can differently conceptualize</p>
<p t="103709" d="2080">how you’re going to get there.</p>
<p t="105789" d="8321">Now, I won’t go into that for the moment.</p>
<p t="114110" d="5040">So let’s say you’re going from point A
to point B. At the highest level of resolution</p>
<p t="119150" d="1930">that means that you’re acting.</p>
<p t="121080" d="4100">And then other things that happen is not only
are you acting, you’re configuring your</p>
<p t="125180" d="1000">perceptions.</p>
<p t="126180" d="1370">We already talked a little bit about this.</p>
<p t="127550" d="3800">You know what you should highlight, what you
should bring your high resolution thinking</p>
<p t="131350" d="2870">to bear on, and you know what you should ignore.</p>
<p t="134220" d="4200">And what you should ignore is those things
that are likely to remain constant as you</p>
<p t="138420" d="6710">pursue the set of transformations, or that
aren’t going to interfere with what you’re</p>
<p t="145130" d="1000">doing.</p>
<p t="146130" d="3570">And so you just have to concentrate, especially
if you set your environment up properly, and</p>
<p t="149700" d="1000">that’s another thing.</p>
<p t="150700" d="4150">Part of the way that people deal with the
complexity of the world is by just not having</p>
<p t="154850" d="1400">it around.</p>
<p t="156250" d="4220">You know so for example, even if you look
in this room, a lot of things are radically</p>
<p t="160470" d="2540">simplified so that you don’t get overwhelmed.</p>
<p t="163010" d="2180">“How many of you have computers here?</p>
<p t="165190" d="3090">Okay, now what does your computer look like?</p>
<p t="168280" d="1140">Keyboard?</p>
<p t="169420" d="1140">Screen?</p>
<p t="170560" d="1700">What about the rest of it?</p>
<p t="172260" d="1130">Flat?</p>
<p t="173390" d="1130">Shiny?</p>
<p t="174520" d="1130">Aluminum?</p>
<p t="175650" d="1130">Why?”</p>
<p t="176780" d="3190">Because you want to act like that’s one
thing.</p>
<p t="179970" d="4260">You don’t want to act like it’s – “how
many transistors are on a chip now?</p>
<p t="184230" d="2630">Like a billion or more?”</p>
<p t="186860" d="3170">A lot, and they’re down to molecular size
those things.</p>
<p t="190030" d="5360">They’re so small now, this is really funny,
they’re so small now that – so imagine</p>
<p t="195390" d="2280">electrons running along a wire.</p>
<p t="197670" d="3500">Now the weird thing about an electron is it
might be there and it might be somewhere else.</p>
<p t="201170" d="5240">So it’s got this vague, non-locality about
it.</p>
<p t="206410" d="2870">You know like maybe it’s supposed to be
there but it’s actually over there; and</p>
<p t="209280" d="1890">would happen now and then.</p>
<p t="211170" d="4550">But the wires are so damn thin now that there’s
some good probability that the electron will</p>
<p t="215720" d="2540">be outside the wire, and that causes short-circuits.</p>
<p t="218260" d="6410">So, that’s quite, well you’ve got quantum
level complexity mucking up your circuitry</p>
<p t="224670" d="1149">in your computer.</p>
<p t="225819" d="2401">But look, the computer is designed this way,
right?</p>
<p t="228220" d="3090">It’s designed so you can ignore it.</p>
<p t="231310" d="1960">The outside of it is a flat shell.</p>
<p t="233270" d="2870">It’s a low-resolution image.</p>
<p t="236140" d="3760">And, not the keyboard because you have to
move it, not the screen and everything else</p>
<p t="239900" d="1440">is flat.</p>
<p t="241340" d="4420">The designer, the primate designer of this
computer does not want your poor primate brain</p>
<p t="245760" d="4400">to be overwhelmed by the fact that this thing
is incomprehensibly complex.</p>
<p t="250160" d="3630">Cars are the same they have that nice shiny
shell on them and so that you can just sort</p>
<p t="253790" d="2919">of low resolution it and that’s good enough.</p>
<p t="256709" d="5431">The walls painted roughly the same color,
we’re doing a lot things around us to reduce</p>
<p t="262140" d="1529">the sensory lobe.</p>
<p t="263669" d="4741">Plus, there are people beadling away in the
background like mad making sure the lights</p>
<p t="268410" d="4000">stay on and making sure the heat stays on,
you know making sure you have air in here.</p>
<p t="272410" d="3350">The place isn’t burning down, there aren’t
crazy people wandering around in here with</p>
<p t="275760" d="1690">shotguns and rifles.</p>
<p t="277450" d="5370">There’s a lot going on so that you can sit
here and pretend that you know enough to stay</p>
<p t="282820" d="1000">alive.</p>
<p t="283820" d="7020">So, we’re also removing a tremendous amount
of complexity as a consequence of social cooperation.</p>
<p t="290840" d="6060">Okay, so these are all parts of the way that
you simplify the world.</p>
<p t="296900" d="4070">You’re in a radical simplification structure
that’s the external society.</p>
<p t="300970" d="3190">Then within that there’s only certain things
you want, and then within that there’s only</p>
<p t="304160" d="6340">certain things you can detect, and then within
that there’s only certain features that</p>
<p t="310500" d="5340">pop out as necessary to contemplate in the
realm that you’re dealing with.</p>
<p t="315840" d="4400">Now, one thing you might ask is well, “what
time span are you usually dealing with?”</p>
<p t="320240" d="3690">You know cause what the world’s made of
depends on the time span; and that’s a tough</p>
<p t="323930" d="1000">one.</p>
<p t="324930" d="1750">We know that it’s more than 1/10th of a
second.</p>
<p t="326680" d="3090">But you can think years into the future, right?</p>
<p t="329770" d="2390">So I might say well, “why are you going
to university?”</p>
<p t="332160" d="3730">Or I might say, “what are you doing right
now?”</p>
<p t="335890" d="3710">And then the answer would be, well I’m sitting
in class.</p>
<p t="339600" d="2060">And then the question would be, “well why
are you sitting in class?”</p>
<p t="341660" d="4120">And the answer to that would be well because
I want to take this course.</p>
<p t="345780" d="1000">“And why?”</p>
<p t="346780" d="2700">Well it’s because I want to get my degree.</p>
<p t="349480" d="1000">“Why?”</p>
<p t="350480" d="4350">Well, because I want to be prepared for a
career and, you know, a productive and high</p>
<p t="354830" d="1800">quality life when I get out.</p>
<p t="356630" d="1000">Well, “why?”</p>
<p t="357630" d="5190">Well you know you can keep saying why, pretty
much indefinitely and as you answer you go</p>
<p t="362820" d="2319">farther and farther out in time scales.</p>
<p t="365139" d="4451">Now, it’s a tricky thing because one of
the things I might tell you, and this is a</p>
<p t="369590" d="5260">very complex cognitive problems is, “well
where should you stop?”</p>
<p t="374850" d="5850">So for example, I could say, “do you want
100 dollars now or do you want 50 000 years</p>
<p t="380700" d="1220">in 75 years?”</p>
<p t="381920" d="3790">You’re going to think, “well I’ll probably
take the 100 dollars now.”</p>
<p t="385710" d="1660">“Well how about in 200 years?”</p>
<p t="387370" d="3380">It’s like, well I’m not going to be there
I’ll take the 100 bucks now.</p>
<p t="390750" d="3010">So obviously thinking out 200 years is not
that helpful.</p>
<p t="393760" d="5750">Now you might think well no, you should calculate
the effects of your actions on the vastest</p>
<p t="399510" d="5550">time span possible and include the largest
number of people, if you’re really going</p>
<p t="405060" d="1480">to equilibrate it.</p>
<p t="406540" d="2250">But the problem is you can’t do the computations.</p>
<p t="408790" d="5580">Because you get, you get this called combinatorial
explosion happening, which is that, it’s</p>
<p t="414370" d="2920">like a chessboard.</p>
<p t="417290" d="1540">You make one move, okay fine.</p>
<p t="418830" d="3350">But then you could make four and with each
of those you could make four more and then</p>
<p t="422180" d="2820">with each of those you could make four more
and soon if you’re looking twenty moves</p>
<p t="425000" d="3430">ahead, it’s like there’s so many moves
that the other person could possibly make,</p>
<p t="428430" d="2030">that looking that far ahead is pointless.</p>
<p t="430460" d="2239">You can’t do the computations.</p>
<p t="432699" d="4271">And so, we don’t know how far you should
look into the future, it depends on how stable</p>
<p t="436970" d="2210">your environment is.</p>
<p t="439180" d="5810">But, one month seems okay, a year, yeah, three
to five years, that’s what Ill have you</p>
<p t="444990" d="2480">do when I have you do the future-authoring
program.</p>
<p t="447470" d="2479">“Twenty years?”</p>
<p t="449949" d="2241">Hmm, probably not.</p>
<p t="452190" d="4350">And the reason for that is the margin of error
in your prediction grows so large that your</p>
<p t="456540" d="3290">prediction isn’t worth anything, and you
can really see how that’s the case now,</p>
<p t="459830" d="3240">cause like, “what’s it going to be like
in twenty years?”</p>
<p t="463070" d="1670">When I was a kid I used to read science fiction.</p>
<p t="464740" d="3410">It was like, plausible accounts of the potential
future.</p>
<p t="468150" d="3310">It’s like, now, who knows?</p>
<p t="471460" d="1780">Anything could happen.</p>
<p t="473240" d="1000">Anything could happen.</p>
<p t="474240" d="2310">You know you could be three quarters robot
in twenty years.</p>
<p t="476550" d="1899">You could have a lifespan of ten thousand
years.</p>
<p t="478449" d="1981">I mean, we just do not know.</p>
<p t="480430" d="2650">We could be living in caves again with everything
in ruins.</p>
<p t="483080" d="2350">We don’t have a clue what’s going to happen.</p>
<p t="485430" d="4780">So twenty-year span, I would say, get friendly
with computers.</p>
<p t="490210" d="1910">So twenty-year span is too long.</p>
<p t="492120" d="6150">So, okay, anyways what I ‘m pointing out
is that you have to calculate, you have to</p>
<p t="498270" d="5709">calculate what you’re doing in across multiple
spans of time, and in the combination, and</p>
<p t="503979" d="2201">in combination with many many people.</p>
<p t="506180" d="1489">And that makes things very complex.</p>
<p t="507669" d="3641">But that’s how you’re building the structures
that you live within.</p>
<p t="511310" d="2979">Alright, so back to this.</p>
<p t="514289" d="5660">You’re at point A you’re going to point
B. So, you are somewhere.</p>
<p t="519949" d="2070">Now, that’s interesting.</p>
<p t="522019" d="1421">You are somewhere.</p>
<p t="523440" d="3079">Now generally what people think about when
they think about being somewhere is that they’re</p>
<p t="526519" d="1000">in a place.</p>
<p t="527519" d="1730">But you’re not just in a place.</p>
<p t="529249" d="3101">You’re in a place at a time.</p>
<p t="532350" d="4200">And I really want to stress that because we
know that the universe, we know that the environment</p>
<p t="536550" d="2190">is four-dimensional, not three-dimensional.</p>
<p t="538740" d="7089">That’s important because you could be in
the same place, and in the next second you’re</p>
<p t="545829" d="3110">still where you were but you’re in a completely
different place.</p>
<p t="548939" d="5731">So for example, if someone walked in here
with a pistol, this would not be the same</p>
<p t="554670" d="1000">place.</p>
<p t="555670" d="3250">Okay, so there’s a reason I’m telling
you that.</p>
<p t="558920" d="5339">And then, there’s the future, and that’s
also a place in time and a place in space.</p>
<p t="564259" d="5950">Okay, now you’re getting from point to the
other, and you’re going to do that by implementing</p>
<p t="570209" d="1000">certain behaviors.</p>
<p t="571209" d="3271">Now you might say, what can happen while your
doing that?</p>
<p t="574480" d="2149">Well here’s three things that can happen.</p>
<p t="576629" d="5351">The thing you want, that can happen.</p>
<p t="581980" d="5839">Something you don’t want, but that you understand,
and something you don’t understand at all,</p>
<p t="587819" d="1601">something completely beyond your comprehension.</p>
<p t="589420" d="3709">And that would generally be a traumatizing
event of some sort.</p>
<p t="593129" d="2421">So, you can either know what’s going to
happen.</p>
<p t="595550" d="4259">Or you cannot know and still be able to cope
with it, or you can not know and not cope</p>
<p t="599809" d="1491">with it.</p>
<p t="601300" d="3180">Of the negative ones they correspond to that
hierarchy, right?</p>
<p t="604480" d="4930">If it’s a little thing that you don’t
understand you just modify a little behavior.</p>
<p t="609410" d="4969">If it’s a big thing that you don’t understand,
well then what?</p>
<p t="614379" d="1380">Well then everything falls apart.</p>
<p t="615759" d="5000">Don’t know where you are, don’t know where
you’re going, and all the behaviors you</p>
<p t="620759" d="1591">have are not helpful.</p>
<p t="622350" d="2139">And that’s when your world falls apart.</p>
<p t="624489" d="3280">So, generally that doesn’t happen.</p>
<p t="627769" d="2880">So, let’s say I set my target on the door.</p>
<p t="630649" d="1310">I’m going to walk to the door.</p>
<p t="631959" d="2250">So here’s what happens.</p>
<p t="634209" d="5401">Instantly, I’m slightly, I have slight negative
emotion about the fact that any of blank issue</p>
<p t="639610" d="1380">in the way people exist.</p>
<p t="640990" d="5829">Because what my brain is doing is reconfiguring
the world, to chart a straight path and anything</p>
<p t="646819" d="5351">that’s in the way is going to make me uneasy-
frustrated, disappointed, anxious.</p>
<p t="652170" d="2810">And you can think about this when you do house
design, by the way.</p>
<p t="654980" d="3570">So, when you’re setting up a room, what
you want to do is figure out what the room</p>
<p t="658550" d="1000">is for.</p>
<p t="659550" d="2060">Then you want to clear the paths for that.</p>
<p t="661610" d="5210">Because then when you walk into the room,
the room will say, “Welcome!</p>
<p t="666820" d="2860">You can do the things you want to do here,
easily.”</p>
<p t="669680" d="2829">And if you don’t do that, it’s all cluttered
up.</p>
<p t="672509" d="3421">It’s like, there’s no difference between
that and being confused mentally.</p>
<p t="675930" d="1860">It’s exactly the same thing.</p>
<p t="677790" d="5239">So, okay, so let’s say I now stand up and
that works and then I walk that way, and that</p>
<p t="683029" d="1000">way and that way.</p>
<p t="684029" d="3970">I keep my eyes on the door, and I’m getting
towards the door.</p>
<p t="687999" d="5991">Well I’m moderately positive about that,
because I’m getting where I’m going, but</p>
<p t="693990" d="5289">I’m also moderately positive about it because
the fact that I’m getting where I’m going</p>
<p t="699279" d="2641">validates my whole theory.</p>
<p t="701920" d="2840">So one of the things that the behaviorists
didn’t get right when they were thinking</p>
<p t="704760" d="5679">about punishment - If an animal lays out a
behavior and you punish it, it’ll stop manifesting</p>
<p t="710439" d="1991">that behavior.</p>
<p t="712430" d="2519">But that isn’t all that happens.</p>
<p t="714949" d="2961">You think about punishing a human being.</p>
<p t="717910" d="4180">They stop manifesting the behavior, but the
behavior isn’t the whole damn thing.</p>
<p t="722090" d="2679">The thing you’re in is this, it’s the
whole thing.</p>
<p t="724769" d="3022">It’s the conception of where they are, it’s
the conception of where they’re going, and</p>
<p t="727791" d="2098">it’s all the behaviors they might need to
get there.</p>
<p t="729889" d="4070">So, you know, maybe they’ll try to circumvent
the punishment, walk around it.</p>
<p t="733959" d="5651">Maybe they’ll try a few more behaviors,
but what happens, you know, so I’m tied</p>
<p t="739610" d="2810">by a chain and I don’t know it, I’m tied
by a chain to the wall.</p>
<p t="742420" d="2800">I start walking that way and I figure out
that I’m chained.</p>
<p t="745220" d="3169">Well, so much for that stupid theory, I’m
not getting to the door.</p>
<p t="748389" d="5831">I’m going to let that view of the world
disintegrate, I’m going to be very upset</p>
<p t="754220" d="4369">about that, and then I have to come up with
another one, which might be, “well how do</p>
<p t="758589" d="2000">I get rid of the chain?”</p>
<p t="760589" d="3521">So when you fail, two things happen.</p>
<p t="764110" d="4319">The behavior that you’re manifesting doesn’t
work, that’s the behaviorist routine.</p>
<p t="768429" d="5981">But it’s worse than that because the whole
little personality that you’re using to</p>
<p t="774410" d="3940">construe the world falls apart.</p>
<p t="778350" d="5490">And the more important the thing is that has
fallen apart, the more of a catastrophe it’s</p>
<p t="783840" d="1299">going to be for you.</p>
<p t="785139" d="2570">So let’s say you’re going to medical school,
that’s what you want to do.</p>
<p t="787709" d="4031">Alright, so, you’re taking the course to
write the exam to pass the course with an</p>
<p t="791740" d="3789">A to apply to medical school to get into medical
school to be a doctor.</p>
<p t="795529" d="2910">You fail the test, “what just happened?”</p>
<p t="798439" d="3900">“ Well, did your whole future fall apart?”</p>
<p t="802339" d="2690">“Or did you just fail the test?”</p>
<p t="805029" d="1581">Who knows, right?</p>
<p t="806610" d="4699">Maybe you’re whole future just fell apart,
it’s like, now you have a GPA of 3.3, like</p>
<p t="811309" d="4541">No, you have to go to the Caribbean to a private
medical school.</p>
<p t="815850" d="3560">You’re not going to get in anywhere in Canada
or the United States, it’s like, okay, “is</p>
<p t="819410" d="1000">your life over?”</p>
<p t="820410" d="1000">“Do you jump off a bridge?”</p>
<p t="821410" d="1700">Well sometimes people do.</p>
<p t="823110" d="4469">And it’s because the little sub-personality
that they created which is the “me that</p>
<p t="827579" d="4331">will be a doctor”, it’s one of these things
the little story, it’s so integral to their</p>
<p t="831910" d="4799">entire identity, that when it collapses they’re
done.</p>
<p t="836709" d="2590">And people get suicidal when that sort of
thing happens.</p>
<p t="839299" d="2931">Okay, so well, “what are you supposed to
do when that happens?”</p>
<p t="842230" d="2509">Well, that’s something that we’ll talk
about.</p>
<p t="844739" d="4690">You know, from the perspective of mental hygiene,
one of the things I would recommend is that</p>
<p t="849429" d="4320">when things go wrong for you, you start at
the highest level of resolution in your hierarchy</p>
<p t="853749" d="1000">and work upward.</p>
<p t="854749" d="3210">You don’t say, “well God, now everything’s
over!”</p>
<p t="857959" d="5470">You know, you might say, “okay, what can
I do to ensure that I do better on the next</p>
<p t="863429" d="1000">test?”</p>
<p t="864429" d="5340">So, then you could analyze your subroutines,
your micro-subroutines, like how much do you</p>
<p t="869769" d="1570">study a day?</p>
<p t="871339" d="2841">Well, sometimes people will tell me “I study
six hours a day.”</p>
<p t="874180" d="1829">It’s like, no you don’t.</p>
<p t="876009" d="3531">You sit in front of what you’re supposed
to be doing for six hours a day, but if you</p>
<p t="879540" d="2570">actually study for more than three I would
be shocked.</p>
<p t="882110" d="6719">Cause I’ve met almost no one in my entire
life, who can sustain high-level concentration</p>
<p t="888829" d="4841">for more than 3 hours, for more than 6 days
a week for more than a year.</p>
<p t="893670" d="1700">You’ll just burn yourself to a crisp.</p>
<p t="895370" d="2989">So no, you’re deluding to yourself into
thinking that you’re studying six hours</p>
<p t="898359" d="1000">a day.</p>
<p t="899359" d="3861">You’d be way better off to cut it down to
two and a half and actually do it.</p>
<p t="903220" d="2770">There’s micro-routine analysis that you
can do.</p>
<p t="905990" d="3920">So that might be helpful, then you can implement
that and run it, that’s what you’d do</p>
<p t="909910" d="1229">if you’re a behavioral psychologist.</p>
<p t="911139" d="3430">Someone comes and says, “my life’s over”
and you say, “well let’s go through the</p>
<p t="914569" d="1031">micro-routines.”</p>
<p t="915600" d="1000">Well, they say, “well what do you mean?</p>
<p t="916600" d="1729">Well they say, “I can’t be a doctor.”</p>
<p t="918329" d="1000">Well, okay.</p>
<p t="919329" d="1651">“Could you be a nurse?</p>
<p t="920980" d="1579">Would that work?</p>
<p t="922559" d="3691">Could you be a medical technician?”</p>
<p t="926250" d="4989">You know, could you be a social worker?</p>
<p t="931239" d="5660">Etc, like okay so your domain is helpful medical
type of person.</p>
<p t="936899" d="5310">Well one element of that is doctor, but it
doesn’t exhaust the entire realm of possibilities.</p>
<p t="942209" d="2550">So I’d say flex up a bit!</p>
<p t="944759" d="2851">You know, it’s not the only path.</p>
<p t="947610" d="3509">And so that would be a more high-level adjustment,
that’d be a more cognitive adjustment.</p>
<p t="951119" d="3630">If you’re in Cognitive Behavioral Therapy,
it’s like, let’s check out your subroutines,</p>
<p t="954749" d="5240">make you more effective at studying, but you
know, let’s loosen up your top-level abstractions.</p>
<p t="959989" d="2121">You should be a good person, let’s say.</p>
<p t="962110" d="1779">Whatever you decide that means.</p>
<p t="963889" d="4800">One element of that is, be productively employed
in a way that doesn’t make you bitter and</p>
<p t="968689" d="1000">nasty.</p>
<p t="969689" d="4400">Okay, doctor might be one way of solving that,
although I wouldn’t be so sure of that.</p>
<p t="974089" d="3810">But it’s not the only way of solving it.</p>
<p t="977899" d="8480">So, alright, you go from point A to B. You
go from point A to point B, and things can</p>
<p t="986379" d="1171">happen along the way.</p>
<p t="987550" d="5180">Things you like – positive emotion, you’re
getting there, plus you’re right.</p>
<p t="992730" d="4089">Things that produce negative emotion – you’re
not getting there, okay.</p>
<p t="996819" d="3760">You can either solve them easily, with small
behavioral adjustment, or you have to go up</p>
<p t="1000579" d="7030">the hierarchy of value and adjust it with
the least possible damage, generally speaking-</p>
<p t="1007609" d="5290">because that’s another rule of thumb in
therapy.</p>
<p t="1012899" d="3500">I can’t be a doctor so I’m going to be
an engineer.</p>
<p t="1016399" d="1701">Well, no.</p>
<p t="1018100" d="5279">You’ve got three years behind you, don’t
just throw it away, use what you’ve got</p>
<p t="1023379" d="3511">and make a minor course deviation, if you
can do it.</p>
<p t="1026890" d="4020">And you know we can talk about broader scale
transformations, but they’re costly.</p>
<p t="1030910" d="4169">But you know stick as close to the path as
you can, while altering it enough so that</p>
<p t="1035079" d="8081">you can proceed to your final goal.</p>
<p t="1043160" d="3760">And so, well I think this is where we’ll
stop today, that leads us to the next part</p>
<p t="1046920" d="1000">of the story.</p>
<p t="1047920" d="2810">So, here’s the kind of story that someone
can tell.</p>
<p t="1050730" d="2610">I was at point A and I went to point B and
here’s how I did it.</p>
<p t="1053340" d="2010">And you’re pretty happy about that story.</p>
<p t="1055350" d="5170">Maybe you go on Youtube and, I found this
a year ago, I had this old car wanted to put</p>
<p t="1060520" d="4680">a stereo in it and so I typed in, “how to
put a stereo in an x old car” and there’s</p>
<p t="1065200" d="5880">a helpful retired southern guy who, you know,
made a Youtube video out of it.</p>
<p t="1071080" d="5780">I was interested in his little story, and
he didn’t have a car stereo in his car and</p>
<p t="1076860" d="3880">he wanted one, I didn’t have a car stereo
in my car and I wanted one.</p>
<p t="1080740" d="3270">So his little story about how to do that was
very interesting to me.</p>
<p t="1084010" d="3530">So I ran the little tape and I did it.</p>
<p t="1087540" d="6400">Great, not particularly transformational,
but good enough.</p>
<p t="1093940" d="1500">I got some information.</p>
<p t="1095440" d="4350">Alright, so that’s an alright story and
you’re running around all of the time interfacing</p>
<p t="1099790" d="3050">with other people and you’re telling them
you’re little story and they’re telling</p>
<p t="1102840" d="1960">you their little story.</p>
<p t="1104800" d="3850">But you know so that’s one thing that interests
people – how to do something successfully.</p>
<p t="1108650" d="2810">But a lot of what people talk about is something
different.</p>
<p t="1111460" d="3760">Which is, I was trying to get from point A
to B and it didn’t work and now I’m at</p>
<p t="1115220" d="1680">a place where it didn’t work.</p>
<p t="1116900" d="2430">And so it’s a problem, right?</p>
<p t="1119330" d="3260">The world’s opened up around me, I don’t
know what to do.</p>
<p t="1122590" d="3750">And the reason you talk to people about that,
is because they have brains.</p>
<p t="1126340" d="1000">And so do you.</p>
<p t="1127340" d="2430">And you might as well have two brains working
if you can and if you’re reciprocal, you</p>
<p t="1129770" d="5780">know, you’re in trouble you come to me,
and we talk it out, and maybe I can help.</p>
<p t="1135550" d="7930">And then because we’re playing a interitive
game, now you owe me a favor.</p>
<p t="1143480" d="6090">Now, you know, I’m not going to be too restrictive
about that, but you know, socially intelligent</p>
<p t="1149570" d="2500">people are reciprocal.</p>
<p t="1152070" d="4760">Ben Franklin once said, you’re new in a
neighborhood what should you do to get integrated?</p>
<p t="1156830" d="2490">He said, ask a neighbor for a favor.</p>
<p t="1159320" d="3650">A small favor – don’t ask will you build
me a new house?</p>
<p t="1162970" d="4180">It’s like, no that’s not going to work.</p>
<p t="1167150" d="4040">But, “my dog’s on the front lawn would
you watch him for 2 minutes while I run to</p>
<p t="1171190" d="1160">the corner store?”</p>
<p t="1172350" d="1310">It’s like, okay they can do that.</p>
<p t="1173660" d="1100">Well why would you do that?</p>
<p t="1174760" d="2630">Well it opens up the possibility of a reciprocal
exchange.</p>
<p t="1177390" d="3760">It’s very very smart, cause now they can
ask you for a favor.</p>
<p t="1181150" d="2510">So you get the trade thing going.</p>
<p t="1183660" d="5000">People who are highly social are really good
at identifying and maintaining reciprocal</p>
<p t="1188660" d="1000">obligations.</p>
<p t="1189660" d="3750">So, we use each other as problem solving resources.</p>
<p t="1193410" d="2040">And a lot of our communication is exactly
that.</p>
<p t="1195450" d="4820">And so basically the story you’re telling
isn’t I was at point A and I went to point</p>
<p t="1200270" d="1000">B and everything worked.</p>
<p t="1201270" d="3020">The story is this instead.</p>
<p t="1204290" d="6930">It’s half of this.</p>
<p t="1211220" d="3270">I was at point A (that’s the top left hand
corner), I was at point A and I was going</p>
<p t="1214490" d="3280">to point B but something didn’t work.</p>
<p t="1217770" d="4730">And then things collapsed, you know, to a
greater or lesser extent, depending on the</p>
<p t="1222500" d="4820">severity of the event, and the closeness of
your friendships that you’re telling the</p>
<p t="1227320" d="3740">story, you’re not going to tell catastrophic
stories to someone on a bus that you just</p>
<p t="1231060" d="2300">sat down beside, unless you have a mental
illness.</p>
<p t="1233360" d="3130">Well, really it’s the truth.</p>
<p t="1236490" d="3940">Sometimes you sit down on a bus, and someone
who has a mental illness will come and sit</p>
<p t="1240430" d="3880">beside you and they will immediately tell
you horrible things about their life.</p>
<p t="1244310" d="2010">And the reason for that is, they have to.</p>
<p t="1246320" d="3390">They don’t have anyone to talk to, they
can’t sort out their brains.</p>
<p t="1249710" d="4680">They’re so desperate, they’re so ruined,
they’re in chaos.</p>
<p t="1254390" d="9170">They’re so ruined, that the proclivity to
proclaim the chaos absolutely overwhelms them.</p>
<p t="1263560" d="3550">And you just can’t deal with someone like
that most of the time because the magnitude</p>
<p t="1267110" d="4420">of the problem they’re facing you with is
way beyond your capacity to solve, so it’s</p>
<p t="1271530" d="1000">just awkward.</p>
<p t="1272530" d="1000">It’s not good.</p>
<p t="1273530" d="2920">Anyways, you say, I was going from point A
to point B, didn’t work!</p>
<p t="1276450" d="5700">Now I don’t know where I am, I don’t know
where I’m going and I’m lost.</p>
<p t="1282150" d="3283">And you say, “in my experience when I was
in a situation like this, I did this, I did</p>
<p t="1285433" d="4797">this and I know someone else in that situation
who did this maybe you could try those.”</p>
<p t="1290230" d="3580">Or maybe you just shut up, and you let the
person talk!</p>
<p t="1293810" d="1740">And that’s often extremely useful.</p>
<p t="1295550" d="2780">And the reason you do that is because they’re
thinking.</p>
<p t="1298330" d="3170">Because people think they think, but they
don’t.</p>
<p t="1301500" d="1890">they talk.</p>
<p t="1303390" d="1000">Thinking is hard.</p>
<p t="1304390" d="4770">Right, it’s a very complex abstract, cognitive
operation.</p>
<p t="1309160" d="4280">And I don’t think that they’re many more
people who can think, than there are people</p>
<p t="1313440" d="1550">who can really read.</p>
<p t="1314990" d="3740">And that’s probably 2-5% of the population
at most.</p>
<p t="1318730" d="2990">And so most of the way that people deal with
that is that they talk.</p>
<p t="1321720" d="4500">And that’s their thinking, and so they have
some ideas about what might be going on, but</p>
<p t="1326220" d="5430">they’re mixed and muddy, so they’re basically
throwing out these ideas, “did this happen?</p>
<p t="1331650" d="1000">Is he like this?</p>
<p t="1332650" d="1110">Is she like that?</p>
<p t="1333760" d="1610">Did I do this?”</p>
<p t="1335370" d="4390">And then they watch you, and if you’re nodding
about one then they think, oh well, you know,</p>
<p t="1339760" d="3880">that seems plausible, and they you lay out
another, and they don’t even notice and</p>
<p t="1343640" d="3040">then you think well that’s off the table,
I didn’t think that was a very good idea,</p>
<p t="1346680" d="6430">but now I’ve got some social validation,
and soon they talk it out, and instead of</p>
<p t="1353110" d="6260">having sixty vaguely defined problems, now
they have five very tightly defined problems.</p>
<p t="1359370" d="2900">They’re feeling a lot better about that,
right, because it’s five snakes instead</p>
<p t="1362270" d="1000">of sixty.</p>
<p t="1363270" d="2040">And maybe they can deal with five snakes.</p>
<p t="1365310" d="3190">So you’ve already helped them a whole bunch
just by listening.</p>
<p t="1368500" d="4380">You know, and then maybe you can be an active
listener, they lay out their story and you</p>
<p t="1372880" d="3600">say, well you said something here that doesn’t
make any sense with this thing that you said.</p>
<p t="1376480" d="2500">So you know, how would you reconcile those?</p>
<p t="1378980" d="5020">You know, it’s this dialectical process
and so the person collapses into chaos, and</p>
<p t="1384000" d="4350">they come and tell you about it and you rescue
them if you can out of the chaos and then</p>
<p t="1388350" d="3200">they pop back up the other side.</p>
<p t="1391550" d="5220">Clinical practice is actually a formalized
version of an ideal relationship.</p>
<p t="1396770" d="2670">So you think, “what’s an ideal relationship?”</p>
<p t="1399440" d="4900">Well, I would say that an ideal relationship
is where both of you are trying to get better</p>
<p t="1404340" d="2280">than you are and you’re helping each other
do it.</p>
<p t="1406620" d="2800">It’s something like that.</p>
<p t="1409420" d="2840">You know if I have a good relationship with
you I would rather that you’re the best</p>
<p t="1412260" d="1500">you, you can be.</p>
<p t="1413760" d="4350">And I would assume that you would also like
that for me.</p>
<p t="1418110" d="4610">I mean things interfere with that because
you might say, well if given how horrible</p>
<p t="1422720" d="5090">I am, if my partner all of a sudden got a
clue, they’d leave, so I’d better interfere</p>
<p t="1427810" d="1990">with that as much as I possibly can.</p>
<p t="1429800" d="1300">People do that all the time.</p>
<p t="1431100" d="3130">You know one of the things they’ll do is
make sure their partner isn’t too attractive.</p>
<p t="1434230" d="3050">It’s like, if you’re so attractive, why
are you with someone like me?</p>
<p t="1437280" d="3280">It’s like, I’ll criticize you when you
look attractive and that’ll fix that.</p>
<p t="1440560" d="2850">So, and people do that sort of thing all the
time.</p>
<p t="1443410" d="2620">This is the revolutionary story.</p>
<p t="1446030" d="2580">This is the real story people tell.</p>
<p t="1448610" d="5290">I was here and I got bloody-well knocked off
my perch and then for a while things were</p>
<p t="1453900" d="1000">not good.</p>
<p t="1454900" d="4850">And then you know I reconfigured myself, I
learned some things, I did some exploration,</p>
<p t="1459750" d="1590">I made some changes, and poof!</p>
<p t="1461340" d="1640">Off the other side I come.</p>
<p t="1462980" d="2030">And I’m a better person for it.</p>
<p t="1465010" d="5010">And if you listen to the way people talk about
their pasts, especially with regards to traumatic</p>
<p t="1470020" d="1160">events, they’ll often tell you that.</p>
<p t="1471180" d="2700">They’ll say, well you know in retrospect
that was the best thing that ever happened</p>
<p t="1473880" d="1000">to me.</p>
<p t="1474880" d="2870">It’s like, those are the people who come
out the other side I’ll tell you.</p>
<p t="1477750" d="5600">Lots of people, they fall into the belly of
the beast and they never come out.</p>
<p t="1483350" d="1690">You see that fairy tales some times.</p>
<p t="1485040" d="4120">So there will be a hero, and he’ll conquer
some sort of dragon or some sort of monster</p>
<p t="1489160" d="2030">and when he cuts it open and a bunch of people
come out.</p>
<p t="1491190" d="1170">It’s like, yeah!</p>
<p t="1492360" d="2290">They’re the ones that got swallowed by the
thing.</p>
<p t="1494650" d="3170">And it isn’t until that person comes along
that solves the problem that all those other</p>
<p t="1497820" d="1820">people get to come out.</p>
<p t="1499640" d="2550">So, that’s a revolutionary story.</p>
<p t="1502190" d="2230">It’s the archetypal revolutionary story.</p>
<p t="1504420" d="2450">And it’s the story of human progress.</p>
<p t="1506870" d="4600">Socially, politically, economically, psychologically.</p>
<p t="1511470" d="3850">And you see that reflected, for example, one
of the things I could tell you about Christianity</p>
<p t="1515320" d="2340">is that it’s a revolutionary narrative.</p>
<p t="1517660" d="4291">At the beginning, so if you look at the Bible,
structured like a piece of literature, at</p>
<p t="1521951" d="4359">the beginning there’s a fall, everyone was
doing fine and then they wake up and they</p>
<p t="1526310" d="3070">find out that the bottom is dropped out.</p>
<p t="1529380" d="4920">And then the whole rest of this book is about,
okay, how do you get back up?</p>
<p t="1534300" d="5670">Actually it is in this, I’ll tell you, partly
what the Bible is, is the attempt by, broadly</p>
<p t="1539970" d="5020">speaking Western civilization, so that would
be all the way from the Middle East, to the</p>
<p t="1544990" d="4550">west - it’s the West’s attempt to figure
out what’s wrong with life and how to fix</p>
<p t="1549540" d="1080">it.</p>
<p t="1550620" d="5600">And it’s the collaboration of thousands
of people over thousands of years, of course</p>
<p t="1556220" d="3980">you can say that about any ancient moral tradition.</p>
<p t="1560200" d="3390">So, the question is, “well is there an answer
to that question?”</p>
<p t="1563590" d="7630">Well that’s one of the next things we’re
going to try to figure out.</p>
<p t="1571220" d="3190">Well let’s say you’re driving down the
401.</p>
<p t="1574410" d="1040">Your car breaks down.</p>
<p t="1575450" d="4720">You’re off by the side of the road, maybe
it’s snowing, it’s like “how bad is</p>
<p t="1580170" d="1000">that?”</p>
<p t="1581170" d="1090">Well you don’t know.</p>
<p t="1582260" d="4570">Maybe someone slides on the snow and runs
over you, you’re dead, it’s really bad.</p>
<p t="1586830" d="4550">So you’re freaking out, maybe your phone
isn’t working so you check your phone, that’s</p>
<p t="1591380" d="2580">not working, it’s like all of a sudden things
have gotten worse.</p>
<p t="1593960" d="2360">So this person drives up behind you and they
stop.</p>
<p t="1596320" d="2100">You’re a bit nervous about them because
what are they up to?</p>
<p t="1598420" d="3760">And they come up, they open the hood and they
say, “well this thing’s loose.”</p>
<p t="1602180" d="1000">And they put it in there.</p>
<p t="1603180" d="1280">It’s like, are you happy?</p>
<p t="1604460" d="4130">Well, yes, because what’s happened to you
is magic.</p>
<p t="1608590" d="2890">First of all you’re not in a car, soon as
it stops working by the way.</p>
<p t="1611480" d="2690">It’s only a car when it’s working.</p>
<p t="1614170" d="2590">When it’s not working it’s a bag of snakes,
right?</p>
<p t="1616760" d="2440">It’s like, uh oh, this car isn’t working.</p>
<p t="1619200" d="1790">“What could be wrong with it?”</p>
<p t="1620990" d="1000">OH!</p>
<p t="1621990" d="2690">It’s an infinite number of things, none
of which I understand!</p>
<p t="1624680" d="3090">And those things are all attached to people
who are going to fix the car.</p>
<p t="1627770" d="1580">“Can I trust them?</p>
<p t="1629350" d="1000">Do I even know who they are?</p>
<p t="1630350" d="1650">Are they going to empty my wallet?</p>
<p t="1632000" d="2620">Do I need to have a new car?”</p>
<p t="1634620" d="3800">So you don’t know, and then well your day
is gone.</p>
<p t="1638420" d="4900">So all of a sudden, what happens is you’re
environment complexifies radically.</p>
<p t="1643320" d="4110">And you get all nervous because there’s
a lot of paths in there that you might have</p>
<p t="1647430" d="2220">to traverse to get back to where you’re
going.</p>
<p t="1649650" d="1450">Someone comes along and goes, tap!</p>
<p t="1651100" d="3080">It’s like you’re happy, and all the complexities
collapsed.</p>
<p t="1654180" d="7020">In one path it went poof, your story is now
implementable again.</p>
<p t="1661200" d="1320">And you’ll pay people for that.</p>
<p t="1662520" d="1000">You do it all the time.</p>
<p t="1663520" d="2100">It’s like, you got a problem, you take it
to an expert.</p>
<p t="1665620" d="4960">They say, it’ll take you an infinite amount
of time to traverse all these possible paths</p>
<p t="1670580" d="3010">so you’re basically screwed, but if you
give me a hundred dollars I can tell you how</p>
<p t="1673590" d="2210">to do it in five minutes.</p>
<p t="1675800" d="1270">You think, “yes!</p>
<p t="1677070" d="1280">That’s worth it!”</p>
<p t="1678350" d="3410">So of course it’s efficient, that’s why
we trade.</p>
<p t="1681760" d="3049">It’s exactly why we trade.</p>
<p t="1684809" d="4441">Things are going to go wrong with you that
I could help, and vice versa, what a deal!</p>
<p t="1689250" d="2740">That’s partly why we’re social and why
we maintain it.</p>
<p t="1691990" d="6370">Like as a collective, we’re way more intelligent
than we would be if we were one person.</p>
<p t="1698360" d="3940">So, alright, that’s a revolutionary story.</p>
<p t="1702300" d="4530">That’s a collapse into the underworld, and
a rebirth.</p>
<p t="1706830" d="3790">And so as soon as you know that it’s so
cool to know that because now, whenever you</p>
<p t="1710620" d="3990">read a classic story of any sort you can think
oh that’s a voyage to the underworld!</p>
<p t="1714610" d="5250">I’ve been there, and you have! everyone’s
been there, the underworld is where that’s</p>
<p t="1719860" d="4410">chaos it’s chaos, it’s where you go when
your life falls apart.</p>
<p t="1724270" d="1700">It has a structure.</p>
<p t="1725970" d="4780">And what’s even cooler about that is, once
you know this, there’s actually guides through</p>
<p t="1730750" d="1000">it.</p>
<p t="1731750" d="1000">It’s like, okay, your world fell apart.</p>
<p t="1732750" d="3020">“What do you do about it?”</p>
<p t="1735770" d="2210">Dying of stress is a bad idea.</p>
<p t="1737980" d="2000">You don’t have to do that.</p>
<p t="1739980" d="4910">So I was talking to one of the students during
the break.</p>
<p t="1744890" d="3790">We were talking about character, and I said,
well, the best thing you can do is build your</p>
<p t="1748680" d="1000">character.</p>
<p t="1749680" d="1000">Here’s a test of character.</p>
<p t="1750680" d="4760">A family member is dying, okay, are you useful
or useless?</p>
<p t="1755440" d="2240">That’s the first question.</p>
<p t="1757680" d="5360">And then a deeper question is, do you make
it as good as it can be?</p>
<p t="1763040" d="3370">Which isn’t going to be that good by the
way, or do you turn it into hell?</p>
<p t="1766410" d="3480">Because you can, and lots of people do.</p>
<p t="1769890" d="2980">So one of the tests of character is - okay,
there’s a crisis.</p>
<p t="1772870" d="1560">Like really!</p>
<p t="1774430" d="2770">“How are you going to respond?</p>
<p t="1777200" d="1000">Are you going to be helpful?</p>
<p t="1778200" d="1760">Or are you going to be useless?”</p>
<p t="1779960" d="1750">Or ever worse, are you going to make it worse?</p>
<p t="1781710" d="5670">I would say, helpful, and the thing that’s
so cool about human beings is that we can</p>
<p t="1787380" d="1440">do that.</p>
<p t="1788820" d="4990">People are so tough it’s insane; as long
as they put themselves in the position.</p>
<p t="1793810" d="2610">My sister-in-law works as a palliative care
nurse.</p>
<p t="1796420" d="4160">It’s like all she does is work with people
who are going to die in two weeks.</p>
<p t="1800580" d="5000">She’s a happy person, partly because she
goes home and thinks, hey this isn’t a palliative</p>
<p t="1805580" d="1660">care ward!</p>
<p t="1807240" d="2290">Well really man!</p>
<p t="1809530" d="2150">Things can be worse.</p>
<p t="1811680" d="2670">And she knows that and she’s reminded of
it every day.</p>
<p t="1814350" d="2530">That’s a person who does not take things
for granted.</p>
