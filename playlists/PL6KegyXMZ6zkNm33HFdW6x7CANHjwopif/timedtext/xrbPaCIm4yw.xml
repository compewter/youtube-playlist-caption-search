<p t="49780" d="4520">Now one of the things that people are very
much confused by in the modern world is what</p>
<p t="54300" d="6349">archaic people meant by gods, and that's
because whatever the deities were that had</p>
<p t="60649" d="3711">the motive force that archaic people attributed
to the gods seemed to have disappeared in</p>
<p t="64360" d="5970">modern culture. Now the Jungian in hypothesis
is that's because they turned into psychological</p>
<p t="70330" d="5810">traits, fundamentally, or motivational forces,
so what the, what archaic societies would</p>
<p t="76140" d="3020">describe as gods, we would describe as motivational
forces,</p>
<p t="79160" d="5530">so, for example, Venus is a goddess, the goddess
of love, and we would associate her power</p>
<p t="84690" d="7000">with love and sex fundamentally, and the reason
that that's a reasonable association from</p>
<p t="92630" d="6419">the archaic standpoint is because the motive
quality that makes up what Venus represents</p>
<p t="99049" d="7000">is transpersonal, which means it's not limited
to one person and it's immortal in that</p>
<p t="106439" d="4341">the motive force that characterizes sexual
affiliation exists whether or not a single</p>
<p t="110780" d="3820">individual exists.
so it's transpersonal, has the force of</p>
<p t="114600" d="6309">a personality , because, if you fall in love,
you're motivated by a certain set of standards</p>
<p t="120909" d="3971">and perspectives, right, if you're gripped
by beauty, say, or if you're gripped by</p>
<p t="124880" d="6990">lust, that imposes a particular view of the
world on you and impels your actions, sometimes</p>
<p t="131870" d="5260">despite your will, and so that would be equivalent,
from the archaic perspective, to possession.</p>
<p t="137130" d="5130">And it's clearly the case that archaic societies
who are engaged in warfare, for example, would</p>
<p t="142260" d="4970">conduct rituals to ensure that the warriors
that made up their societies were, in fact,</p>
<p t="147230" d="4390">possessed by the correct god, so it might
be Mars, for example, the Roman God of War,</p>
<p t="151620" d="3589">so that on the battlefield they exhibited
the proper characteristics of somebody who</p>
<p t="155209" d="6171">was in a battle, right, rage you can think,
rage, so possession by the God of War would</p>
<p t="161380" d="2590">be equivalent to this possession by a state
of rage</p>
<p t="163970" d="5900">Now, it's not quite that simple, it isn't
only that archaic people externalized motive</p>
<p t="169870" d="3890">forces and gave them the status of deities,
what they did was more complex than that,</p>
<p t="173760" d="3680">and I think you can understand that a little
bit better if you start to, if you start to</p>
<p t="177440" d="4579">give some, uh, thought to the modern behavioral
notion of the stimulus.</p>
<p t="182019" d="5601">Now the stimulus is a very, very weird concept,
because the behaviourists who were interested</p>
<p t="187620" d="4700">in taking apart what was inside the brain
would attribute motive force to the stimulus,</p>
<p t="192320" d="4800">right, they'd say, if you present an animal
with a stimulus, he will therefor act, and</p>
<p t="197120" d="5299">that meant that the behaviours were making
the presupposition that the motive power resided</p>
<p t="202419" d="3901">in some manner in the stimulus. Well and why,
why would they think like that?</p>
<p t="206320" d="5530">Well, it's an archaic mode of thought in
a sense. You can imagine a child saying, um,</p>
<p t="211850" d="5090">one of my friends today made me really angry,
right, which means that the child is essentially</p>
<p t="216940" d="5479">conflating his or her own internal emotional
state with the proximal stimulus that gave</p>
<p t="222419" d="5151">rise to that state, and you see complex associations
like that taking place with regards to the</p>
<p t="227570" d="4370">apprehension of beauty, say, because beauty
is a very, very complex and difficult to localize</p>
<p t="231940" d="6340">phenomena; if you're very attracted to someone,
are you attracted by them? Well in a sense,</p>
<p t="238280" d="3290">of course, you are, because there they are,
but in another sense you're not at all because</p>
<p t="241570" d="6430">what's happening is that you're engaged
as much in the in attraction as anything that's</p>
<p t="248000" d="3729">motivating you from the outside world, and
I think that partly accounts for your sense</p>
<p t="251729" d="4401">of foolishness, especially if the person that
you're attracted to doesn't return your</p>
<p t="256130" d="280">attraction,</p>
<p t="256410" d="7000">I mean, you, you know that from your perceptual
perspective you're attracted and dominated</p>
<p t="263699" d="5331">by the object, but, uh, by the same token,
you know entirely that, easy as it is to presume</p>
<p t="269030" d="5630">it's them and their fault, say, pretty much
it all has to do with you, so in the modern</p>
<p t="274660" d="4409">world where we've been able to separate
out the object and the motive force of the</p>
<p t="279069" d="4940">object, the deities have sort of moved inside
of us and become psychological forces, but</p>
<p t="284009" d="3650">you can understand if you think about it in
this manner that things weren't so clear</p>
<p t="287659" d="4750">prior to the dawn of the empirical age,</p>
<p t="292409" d="7000">that gives you a little bit of background
with regards to what the notion of deity meant</p>
<p t="300689" d="7000">to archaic societies who still utilize those
notions as explanatory terms. Okay, so we</p>
<p t="308870" d="4859">know that if you're caught up in one of
these little, uh, world games, that you may</p>
<p t="313729" d="5000">be motivated by something very, very fundamental,
right, a, a tendency that transcends you the</p>
<p t="318729" d="6250">tendency to propagate yourself, say, Freud's
fundamental motivational level, sexual affiliation</p>
<p t="324979" d="6351">or the tendency to maintain yourself, those
you could say are the fundamental gods of</p>
<p t="331330" d="4570">existence, the fundamental driving forces,
and it's there, it's the interaction of</p>
<p t="335900" d="4829">those two forces over great periods of time
that produce the great diversity of life and,</p>
<p t="340729" d="4660">and human life, that we see before us, and
each of those fundamental, most fundamental</p>
<p t="345389" d="7000">of gods, have their differentiated minion
so to speak so that while engaged in the meta</p>
<p t="352870" d="6560">goal of self preservation, you act out plots
of hunger and plots of thirst and you move</p>
<p t="359430" d="6799">from cold to hot or from hot to cold depending
on your particular, uh, on your particular,</p>
<p t="366229" d="4171">on the particular temperature of your surroundings
or with regards to self propagation.</p>
<p t="370400" d="4889">You're attracted to people or are repelled
by them for reasons that are frequently absolutely</p>
<p t="375289" d="3880">beyond your comprehension by the way, so I
just found out this week, uh, and this is</p>
<p t="379169" d="5250">absolutely staggering, I think, that if you,
um, if you run an experiment on a group of</p>
<p t="384419" d="4800">women and you track their menstrual cycle,
and then you give them t-shirts that men have</p>
<p t="389219" d="5801">worn to smell, that women who are ovulating
like the smell of symmetrical men better than</p>
<p t="395020" d="4459">A-symmetrical men, so and that's partly
because symmetrical men are probably more</p>
<p t="399479" d="5960">healthy, but this is a good example of how
the motive forces that configure your world</p>
<p t="405439" d="4591">are dependent on instinctual forces that are
not only beyond your consciousness, but they're</p>
<p t="410030" d="5580">beyond even, at the moment, any of our, uh,
explicit explanations.</p>
<p t="415610" d="7000">So, uh, another finding that's very similar
that I came across recently, it turns out</p>
<p t="424280" d="6719">that mice will not mate with mice that have
RH blood factors that are likely to produce,</p>
<p t="430999" d="7000">um, unfit offspring, uh, the more closely
genetically related the RH factors, the more</p>
<p t="438050" d="5669">likely there is to be a, a, an, a catastrophe
with regards to offspring, and the mice seem</p>
<p t="443719" d="5181">to detect the RH factor by smell so recently
this was run by, with women, and it is also</p>
<p t="448900" d="4389">the case that women prefer men whose RH factors
are at an optimal distance from them in terms</p>
<p t="453289" d="4821">of smell, so this is some example of how these
unbelievably archaic systems, â€˜cause like</p>
<p t="458110" d="6869">the old factory systems are unbelievably archaic,
produce alterations in world view at a level</p>
<p t="464979" d="7000">that's massively below consciousness, so
underneath your cortical shell, which is tonically</p>
<p t="474680" d="5319">inhibiting all your emotional and motivational
systems, lies all these motivational and emotional</p>
<p t="479999" d="4230">systems, and they have branches that grow
up into the cortex, and they have the capacity</p>
<p t="484229" d="5800">to control your behaviour completely and voluntarily,
so, for example, if you're gripped by fear,</p>
<p t="490029" d="3831">if you're gripped by fear, it's very,
very difficult to overcome that voluntarily,</p>
<p t="493860" d="3519">and at least initially you won't be able
to, which is to say that when the chips are</p>
<p t="497379" d="6900">down, the underlying motivational and emotional
systems have control. Okay. So then what happens</p>
<p t="504279" d="3760">from that perspective, then what happens when
you encounter something you don't understand,</p>
<p t="508039" d="4771">and I think the best way to explain it is
something like generalize disinhibition, which</p>
<p t="512810" d="5419">is that all your underlying motivational and
emotional systems are more or less disinhibited</p>
<p t="518229" d="4201">simultaneously, and the reason for that is
because you want to be maximally prepared</p>
<p t="522430" d="4180">to do whatever the hell is necessary to do
when you are somewhere that you don't understand,</p>
<p t="526610" d="4930">and because you don't know what that thing
is going to be, all your systems go on, and</p>
<p t="531540" d="4590">when psychologists talk about stress, which
is an abysmal word, right, it means everything</p>
<p t="536130" d="5380">and nothing, when psychologists talk about
stress, what they mean is, generalized disinhibition</p>
<p t="541510" d="1230">of emotion and motivation</p>
<p t="542740" d="7000">so then you come to the case of ancient Egypt
And one of the things Eliade points out, which</p>
<p t="551550" d="3760">I think is really interesting, I mean really
phenomenal, the story I'm going to tell</p>
<p t="555310" d="6219">you right now was essentially revealed in
Egyptian culture at the dawn of the culture</p>
<p t="561529" d="4851">rather than developing over the course of
the culture. So the Egyptians had a revelation,</p>
<p t="566380" d="5880">right, immediately that the most fundamental
of gods was the one who created as a consequence</p>
<p t="572260" d="7000">of his tongue and his speech, very much akin
to the Sumerian idea with regards to Marduk</p>
<p t="581300" d="2159">and also to later Judao-Christian ideas.</p>
<p t="583459" d="5861">so here's the story. There's four players
in this drama, OK? There's Osiris, his wife</p>
<p t="589320" d="7000">Isis, Horace their son, and Seth. And Seth
is Osiris' evil brother, OK? Now Osiris</p>
<p t="599220" d="6520">was a remarkable guy. He was the founder of
the Egyptian state from the mythological perspective,</p>
<p t="605740" d="4580">so kind of like Romulus and Remus for Rome,
a myth or like George Washington for the U.S.,</p>
<p t="610320" d="6340">right? A mythologized figure who represented
all of the Pharaohs and people for that matter</p>
<p t="616660" d="2100">who'd actually constructed the Egyptian
state.</p>
<p t="618760" d="4960">Osiris, father of Egypt, so to speak, but
Osiris is kind of old and a little archaic</p>
<p t="623720" d="4970">and maybe a little bit senile and even possibly
a little bit naÃ¯ve in that you know even</p>
<p t="628690" d="5040">no matter how great you were in your youth,
as time goes on you lose contact with environmental</p>
<p t="633730" d="4919">transformations and the old rules that you
lived by are not necessarily applicable to</p>
<p t="638649" d="4690">the present and some of those things that
you ignore become paramount in importance.</p>
<p t="643339" d="5571">And it turns out that Osiris has an evil brother,
Seth, and Seth eventually turns into Satan</p>
<p t="648910" d="6739">as mythology develops through the centuries.
And Seth is a nasty guy, right, I mean what</p>
<p t="655649" d="6541">he wants more than anything is undeserved
dominion over the Egyptian state. Now Osiris,</p>
<p t="662190" d="4519">because he's not paying attention and because
he isn't sufficiently cognizant anymore</p>
<p t="666709" d="7000">of the power of evil, more or less ignores
his evil brother, who in turn chops him into</p>
<p t="675290" d="6950">pieces and then distributes his pieces all
over the Egyptian state. Now you might say:</p>
<p t="682240" d="4459">why didn't he just kill him, right? I mean
you'd think chopping him up would kill him</p>
<p t="686699" d="4931">but he's a god, you can't just kill them.
The reason in mythology, and you see this</p>
<p t="691630" d="4129">in movies as well, where the villain never
quite dies or the hero never quite dies, is</p>
<p t="695759" d="5580">because even if you eliminate individual embodiments
of what those figures represent, new embodiments</p>
<p t="701339" d="3821">manifest themselves virtually immediately.
So one of the things mythology is quite clear</p>
<p t="705160" d="4950">about is that you never win a final battle
with evil. It's a permanent property of</p>
<p t="710110" d="6250">the world.</p>
<p t="716360" d="6190">So anyways, Seth hacks up Osiris, spreads
him all over the land. Osiris ends up living</p>
<p t="722550" d="5149">a kind of shadowy and nebulous ghost-like
existence down in the underworld and Seth</p>
<p t="727699" d="7000">becomes the ruler of the state. A nasty story.
Alright, but Osiris has Isis as a wife. Now</p>
<p t="735519" d="7000">Isis had a huge cult. She was a powerful goddess,
goddess of the under world, a kind of combination</p>
<p t="743199" d="5481">of Kali and Diana, so to speak, capable of
tremendous destructive power but also the</p>
<p t="748680" d="6459">source of all good things â€“ something very
much like Tiamat. Now Isis got wind of her</p>
<p t="755139" d="6870">husband's disintegration, so to speak, and
she went searching around Egypt till she found</p>
<p t="762009" d="3911">his phallus and with it she makes herself
pregnant.</p>
<p t="765920" d="6960">OK, so what does that mean exactly? It means
something like this. The collapse of any great</p>
<p t="772880" d="7000">order brings with it new potential and I think
this is something that capitalism has way</p>
<p t="780800" d="7000">over forms of government like communism. Capitalism
has mechanisms in place to allow large structures</p>
<p t="789250" d="4880">that are no longer meeting their function
to collapse. But frequently when they collapse,</p>
<p t="794130" d="5180">it's not like they disintegrate into dust,
right, they disintegrate into sub-components,</p>
<p t="799310" d="6050">so to speak, many of which then come to terms
with the fact that the order has collapsed</p>
<p t="805360" d="4209">and build something new. So you can't get
rid of culture so easily. You can hack it</p>
<p t="809569" d="4330">up into bits, you can disembody it, so to
speak, you can spread it all over the state,</p>
<p t="813899" d="6541">you can introduce chaos into it. But that's
something that has the potential of new birth</p>
<p t="820440" d="5410">like the phoenix rising from the ashes.
So anyways, Isis, who's the matrix, who's</p>
<p t="825850" d="7000">Tiamat, gets Osiris' phallus, which is the
container of the germ of culture, right, the</p>
<p t="833139" d="6010">phenomenon that's capable of the seminal
idea, and she makes herself pregnant and she</p>
<p t="839149" d="4880">gives birth to Horace, who's the long-lost
son of the rightful king, right, a very typical</p>
<p t="844029" d="7000">mythological motif. OK, so Horace is alienated
from the kingdom, which is another very common</p>
<p t="851759" d="4791">mythological motif, you know like how King
Arthur, for example, is raised by commoners?</p>
<p t="856550" d="6060">The same story pops up in the story for Christ,
for example, because Christ has heavenly parents</p>
<p t="862610" d="4830">but then he also has kind of ordinary parents
and it's a very common motif. Anyways, so</p>
<p t="867440" d="7000">Horace grows up outside of the classical structure
of the Egyptian state, which is tilted terribly</p>
<p t="876139" d="5291">towards evil because Seth has dominated, because
Osiris was too blind to his evil brother to</p>
<p t="881430" d="4699">take appropriate defensive actions, and he
grows to maturity. And then he decides, like</p>
<p t="886129" d="5971">all rightful sons of the long-lost king, to
reclaim his heritage. So he goes back to Egypt,</p>
<p t="892100" d="6400">right, and he has this vicious battle with
Seth and in the process, Seth tears out one</p>
<p t="898500" d="5879">of his eyes. Well, fine, and that's an indication
of just exactly how devastating a battle with</p>
<p t="904379" d="5561">the forces of evil, so to speak, precisely
are. They represent a critical threat to the</p>
<p t="909940" d="4430">integrity of consciousness, right? That's
why he loses an eye. Well, luckily enough,</p>
<p t="914370" d="4430">Horace has got his act together and he does
defeat Seth and he banishes him and he gets</p>
<p t="918800" d="7000">the eye back. And then you think: OK, great,
pop the eye back in, become emperor, everything's</p>
<p t="926379" d="580">fine</p>
<p t="926959" d="3901">Now let's backtrack a little bit and think
about this politically. Now the Egyptians</p>
<p t="930860" d="6459">had this really weird idea. They had the idea
that the living pharaoh was the living pharaoh</p>
<p t="937319" d="4681">and the dead pharaoh at the same time. makes
no sense rationally but it makes a lot of</p>
<p t="942000" d="3730">sense from a narrative perspective because
what they were saying is something like this:</p>
<p t="945730" d="4479">look, you got to think that when you become
king, or when you become president, or when</p>
<p t="950209" d="5411">you take on a role of that absolute magnitude,
that then you're partly you but you're</p>
<p t="955620" d="4100">also partly this role and there's really
no way out of that, right? And the role is</p>
<p t="959720" d="4979">composed of the unbelievable weight of the
cultural tradition that you're representing.</p>
<p t="964699" d="3841">And you can say: well, that's true for being
king or for being president but it's also</p>
<p t="968540" d="4620">true if you become a doctor or a lawyer, any
sort of specialized occupation. It's partly</p>
<p t="973160" d="4630">you, because you're embodying the role,
but it's partly the role too. So the pharaoh</p>
<p t="977790" d="5109">is the live pharaoh and the dead pharaoh because
the dead pharaoh represents culture, right?</p>
<p t="982899" d="2880">The king is dead, long live the king.</p>
<p t="985779" d="5250">OK, but paralleling that idea was the idea
that the pharaoh was not only the dead pharaoh</p>
<p t="991029" d="3800">and the live pharaoh at the same time but
that he was Osiris and Horace at the same</p>
<p t="994829" d="5950">time. But then you think in the story, Horace
has taken over Seth, he's got his eye back,</p>
<p t="1000779" d="4261">he can be king. But he isn't king yet and
this is where the Egyptians really get their</p>
<p t="1005040" d="5080">act together and I think, of the two stories
that I'm telling you, this is the one that</p>
<p t="1010120" d="4769">has the most significance, I think, for modern
people because we're so likely to sidestep</p>
<p t="1014889" d="5870">our obligation to our culture, whatever that
happens to be. So instead of popping this</p>
<p t="1020759" d="3551">eye back in his head, which is the first thing
you'd think he does, he decides he's going</p>
<p t="1024310" d="4750">to go back to the underworld, where Osiris
is living in this ghostlike and dead manner,</p>
<p t="1029060" d="4040">since he's been chopped up by Seth. So he
goes down into the underworld, which is no</p>
<p t="1033100" d="4589">piece of cake, and he finds Osiris there in
this kind of half-dead state and he gives</p>
<p t="1037689" d="7000">him his eye. And that enlightens Osiris, right,
it gives him vision and so then he takes Osiris</p>
<p t="1047090" d="6720">back to Egypt arm in arm, so to speak. And
it's the conjunction of Osiris and Horace</p>
<p t="1053810" d="5140">that constitutes the basis for Egyptian sovereignty
and that is bloody brilliant, right, because</p>
<p t="1058950" d="5670">the Egyptians figured out that so Horace is
Marduk, for all intents and purposes, right?</p>
<p t="1064620" d="6190">He's this avenging hero. In the Egyptian
story, he fights political corruption rather</p>
<p t="1070810" d="4610">than chaos but you can understand that those
are two flipsides of the hero archetype, they</p>
<p t="1075420" d="480">are.</p>
<p t="1075900" d="5700">The hero archetype has two basic elements.
One is the confrontation of the terrible aspect</p>
<p t="1081600" d="6100">of nature, chaos in its most brutal form,
and the other is the confrontation with the</p>
<p t="1087700" d="4590">archaic aspect of culture. And in some ways,
those aren't distinguishable because if</p>
<p t="1092290" d="6200">culture isn't archaic, chaos never makes
itself present. So which is to say you can't</p>
<p t="1098490" d="7000">separate out political degradation from environmental
degradation, say, it's the same idea.</p>
<p t="1108690" d="4500">So anyways, Horace has this great idea. He
needs his father, right, and I told you about</p>
<p t="1113190" d="4970">the same motif emerging in Pinocchio, we already
looked at that, right? Pinocchio doesn't</p>
<p t="1118160" d="5290">become genuine until he risks his life saving
his father, alright, so the same thing is</p>
<p t="1123450" d="4000">happening in this particular situation. So
that's pretty cool. So then you get the</p>
<p t="1127450" d="5580">situation where the Egyptians characterize
sovereignty as the capability to overcome</p>
<p t="1133030" d="5560">evil in the political domain, combined with
â€“ and that's a youthful capability, right</p>
<p t="1138590" d="5300">â€“ combined with the wisdom of the past,
alright? Then you look at that from a political</p>
<p t="1143890" d="5040">perspective and you find out already that
the Egyptians viewed the pharaoh as the live</p>
<p t="1148930" d="1940">pharaoh and the dead pharaoh simultaneously.</p>
<p t="1150870" d="3750">But then you find out something else that's
interesting and it gives you some real insight</p>
<p t="1154620" d="5080">into just exactly how bloody powerful these
ideas were. So you think: what did the Egyptians</p>
<p t="1159700" d="4600">do with their spare time? And then you think:
well, they built the pyramids, right, I mean</p>
<p t="1164300" d="6490">and that was no trivial undertaking. It was
sort of the 5000 B.C. equivalent of flying</p>
<p t="1170790" d="4090">to Mars. And I mean the pyramids are pretty
impressive now but they were a hell of a lot</p>
<p t="1174880" d="4620">more impressive in their original form because
they were in the middle of an immense complex.</p>
<p t="1179500" d="5870">And the pyramids were dedicated to the immortality
of the pharaoh and the pharaoh was possessed</p>
<p t="1185370" d="6500">by a spirit called Ka and Ka was his immortal
spirit and it was the union of Horace and</p>
<p t="1191870" d="580">Osiris, OK?</p>
<p t="1192450" d="7000">So Egyptian society was dedicated to deifying
the immortal spirit of the pharaoh, the union</p>
<p t="1201690" d="5900">of Horace and Osiris. And it was the union
that gave the, it was this identification</p>
<p t="1207590" d="6720">with this union that gave the pharaoh a phenomenon
the Egyptians called Maat and Maat was like</p>
<p t="1214310" d="5440">truth or good order. And you could think about
it as conscience in a sense is if the pharaoh</p>
<p t="1219750" d="7000">was utilizing the union of Horace and Osiris,
then he would have an intuitive ability to</p>
<p t="1226980" d="6230">decide what the appropriate course of order
was. And so the Egyptians would say, for example,</p>
<p t="1233210" d="3800">when the pharaoh came into the court, they'd
say: the sun has risen by that they meant</p>
<p t="1237010" d="5520">the power that reigned over the dominion of
the night had arrived. They conceptualized</p>
<p t="1242530" d="7000">maat as the capacity to put order in the place
of chaos, essentially formally. So they assimilated</p>
<p t="1249540" d="4590">the union of Horace and Osiris with the capability
of putting order in the face of chaos. They</p>
<p t="1254130" d="6190">regarded that as immortal and they spent all
of the excess resources of their society glorifying</p>
<p t="1260320" d="4670">that idea. And you think: you don't produce
something like the pyramids without really</p>
<p t="1264990" d="5370">being possessed by an idea, right? This is
no trivial undertaking, it's going over</p>
<p t="1270360" d="3890">a period of several hundred, if not several
thousand, years. That takes an awful lot of</p>
<p t="1274250" d="5230">work. So this idea of the immortality of the
union of Horace and Osiris and its association</p>
<p t="1279480" d="4350">with sovereignty was an absolutely potent
idea for the Egyptians. It gave their whole</p>
<p t="1283830" d="1760">culture motive force.</p>
<p t="1285590" d="5220">OK, so the Egyptians thought: the pharaoh
is immortal and that's the reason why and</p>
<p t="1290810" d="3940">we more or less partake in his immortality
by being his subjects. So that was a pretty</p>
<p t="1294750" d="5280">good deal. But then Eliade points out something
very interesting and this is called the democratization</p>
<p t="1300030" d="6210">of Osiris and what you found was that initially
there were certain symbolic presentations</p>
<p t="1306240" d="4020">representing the immortality of the pharaoh
that could only be used by the pharaoh. But</p>
<p t="1310260" d="6430">as Egyptian culture continued to develop,
then the symbolic representations of immortality</p>
<p t="1316690" d="7000">started to be adopted by the aristocracy.
Now what did that mean? It meant that this</p>
<p t="1324040" d="7000">process that the Egyptians had conceptualized
as integral to the order of the state was</p>
<p t="1331270" d="5280">no longer solely embodied in the hands of
the pharaoh, right? It had started to drift</p>
<p t="1336550" d="5920">down the power hierarchy into the aristocracy,
OK? Well then you think: what happens after</p>
<p t="1342470" d="6420">that? So by the end of Egyptian society, the
aristocrats were characterized by an identity</p>
<p t="1348890" d="4730">with the union of Horace and Osiris, right?
Sovereignty had started to spread itself out.</p>
<p t="1353620" d="5290">And you think: what starts to happen with
the Greeks, right? The Greeks attribute sovereignty</p>
<p t="1358910" d="5790">to every male Greek. Barbarians, no. Women,
no. But at least all males, right? You get</p>
<p t="1364700" d="4080">a beginning of a democratic notion there.</p>
<p t="1368780" d="7000">The Jews developing ideas that, if not derived
from Egypt, were at least similar in structure</p>
<p t="1378240" d="7000">to Egyptian ideas, say: not the aristocracy,
not the pharaoh but every individual has the</p>
<p t="1386070" d="6780">capacity of establishing a direct relationship
with the transcendent deity, right? Then you</p>
<p t="1392850" d="5060">have a Christian revolution that follows that
where the idea that sovereignty inheres in</p>
<p t="1397910" d="5440">the individual, is distributed to everyone,
right, everyone â€“ male, female, criminal,</p>
<p t="1403350" d="6070">non-criminal, murderer, rapist, taxman, you
name it, sovereignty inheres within them.</p>
<p t="1409420" d="6220">And it's on that soil that our whole democratic
culture emerges â€“ these unbelievably archaic</p>
<p t="1415640" d="5600">ideas, first acted out, right, first embodied
in ritual, first dramatized then only told</p>
<p t="1421240" d="6500">as stories, developing more and more coherence
over stretches of time of thousands of years,</p>
<p t="1427740" d="6740">not hundreds of years but thousands of years,
becoming more coherent, becoming more pointed,</p>
<p t="1434480" d="4000">becoming more relevant with regards to their
embodiment, then starting to become understood</p>
<p t="1438480" d="4200">explicitly and distributed to the entire society.</p>
<p t="1442680" d="7000">And it's on that ground that our world rests,
not on the ground of rationality, as established</p>
<p t="1452420" d="7000">in say Europe in 1500. What we have is much
more profound and solid and deep than any</p>
<p t="1460300" d="6860">mere rational construction. It's a from
of government, an equilibrated state, so to</p>
<p t="1467160" d="7000">speak, that's a consequence of an emergent,
if not evolutionary, at least social evolutionary</p>
<p t="1474930" d="5050">process. And I would say that it stems much
farther back than that because you can imagine</p>
<p t="1479980" d="7000">something like this. Look, if this ideal personality
that should be sovereign is represented by</p>
<p t="1487420" d="5250">the optimal combination of creativity and
traditionalism, say, if that's the optimal</p>
<p t="1492670" d="6340">combination, and if we're prepared to regard
that as optimal, if that's a â€“ if that's</p>
<p t="1499010" d="5480">what you perceive when you perceive someone
that you respect and admire, then you could</p>
<p t="1504490" d="6050">say that success in our social hierarchies
is predicated on the degree to which you actually</p>
<p t="1510540" d="6600">embody that combination. And then you see
an interaction between individual success</p>
<p t="1517140" d="4480">and the social construction that would be
an interaction that extends over centuries</p>
<p t="1521620" d="6040">or even thousands of centuries so that as
these ideas become more and more developed,</p>
<p t="1527660" d="6270">we become more and more adapted to embodying
them as a consequence of evolutionary pressure.</p>
<p t="1533930" d="2620">So it's not just cultural, it's also biological.</p>
<p t="1536550" d="6770">So our political presuppositions rest on a
cultural basis which is unbelievably archaic,</p>
<p t="1543320" d="5340">resting in turn on something even lower than
that. And I think examples of that are those</p>
<p t="1548660" d="4700">that I've provided you with already. We
know, for example, that chimps who have to</p>
<p t="1553360" d="3790">live in a dominance hierarchy are very aggressive,
especially the males, but they're also very</p>
<p t="1557150" d="5230">cooperative. So the males who are aggressive
spend a substantial amount of time repairing</p>
<p t="1562380" d="5530">social boundaries in the aftermath of an aggressive
incident because they're just as concerned</p>
<p t="1567910" d="6250">with keeping the bloody hierarchy intact as
they are in climbing it. They have to be.</p>
<p t="1574160" d="4760">And we know that even wolves won't kill
a subordinate wolf once they've defeated</p>
<p t="1578920" d="4490">it. They allow the subordinate wolf to maintain
its own existence, right, they have this notion,</p>
<p t="1583410" d="6920">this procedural notion that â€“ even those
entities that appear insignificant may, in</p>
<p t="1590330" d="5320">some manner that's beyond speech, still
contribute to the integrity of the whole.</p>
<p t="1595650" d="3440">And that's an idea that's very much similar
to our notion that sovereignty inheres in</p>
<p t="1599090" d="4530">the individual, right? We've taken it further.
No matter what you do, even if you're in</p>
<p t="1603620" d="4740">clear violation of the law, your rights remain
intact because no matter how outcast you are</p>
<p t="1608360" d="4080">and how apparently beyond redemption, your
existence may still contribute something to</p>
<p t="1612440" d="3970">the integrity of the whole. And as far as
I'm concerned, that doesn't appear to</p>
<p t="1616410" d="5950">be a metaphorical idea. If you dismiss it,
you cannot dismiss it without simultaneously</p>
<p t="1622360" d="5610">dismissing the ground on which our states
rest. And so then you have to ask yourself:</p>
<p t="1627970" d="5210">are you willing to do that? And if the answer
is no, well then you have to start to question</p>
<p t="1633180" d="4540">what it is that you actually believe, because
if you buy the doctrine of natural rights,</p>
<p t="1637720" d="6700">which you do, you act it out, then all of
this follows in its wake, or it rests on sand.</p>
<p t="1644420" d="7000">And it bloody well better not rest on sand.</p>
