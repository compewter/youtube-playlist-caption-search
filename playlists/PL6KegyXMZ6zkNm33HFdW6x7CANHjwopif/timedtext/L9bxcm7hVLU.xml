<p t="33360" d="4680">You know, when a computer starts up, it has
to boot – bootstrap, is what that means.</p>
<p t="38040" d="5500">And that boot straps itself by continuing
to engage in more and more complex processes</p>
<p t="43540" d="1090">as it starts up.</p>
<p t="44630" d="4230">So, it starts up with a simple process, and
that triggers a more complex process.</p>
<p t="48860" d="4180">And that triggers a more complex process,
and that way, the computer boots itself into</p>
<p t="53040" d="1000">existence.</p>
<p t="54040" d="4000">Well, that's exactly what we did, except
we did it over like three billion years, right?</p>
<p t="58040" d="4570">We started out as these unbelievably simple
organisms that can pretty much do nothing</p>
<p t="62610" d="7250">at all, except replicate and develop much
more and more complex forms over this tremendously</p>
<p t="69860" d="2420">long period of evolutionary history, right?</p>
<p t="72280" d="4720">So, that's how we solved the problem that
you can't know anything without knowing</p>
<p t="77000" d="3440">something, and that you can't have knowledge
without generating it.</p>
<p t="80440" d="1990">It's: A little knowledge, a little more
generation.</p>
<p t="82430" d="1630">A little knowledge, a little more generation.</p>
<p t="84060" d="5580">A little knowledge-- this huge spiraling process
that expends-- extends over vast amounts of</p>
<p t="89640" d="5740">time; information encoded in your body, right,
and as part of your-- as part of the nature</p>
<p t="95380" d="4700">of your being; and information encoded in
your culture, reflected inside, you enacted</p>
<p t="100080" d="6440">out in the world.</p>
<p t="106520" d="7110">And as scientists, you know, with this 500-year
history of science behind us, we always believe</p>
<p t="113630" d="3960">that it's the material substrate of things
that's the reality.</p>
<p t="117590" d="4740">But it is more complicated than that, because
even the material substrate that we consider</p>
<p t="122330" d="4670">as scientists isn't merely unformed stuff,
right?</p>
<p t="127000" d="1240">It has structure.</p>
<p t="128240" d="1000">It's patterned.</p>
<p t="129240" d="6410">It's full of information, and there are
physicists working now who believe that conceptualization</p>
<p t="135650" d="4910">of the ground of being – the material ground
uh, of being – as information is a more</p>
<p t="140560" d="5580">fruitful metaphor than conceptualization of
the ground of being as like unformed matter.</p>
<p t="146140" d="1960">It's not unformed, right?</p>
<p t="148100" d="1970">It's patterned and regular.</p>
<p t="150070" d="5610">Informative so that if you investigate it,
it reveals order as not just a material structure.</p>
<p t="155680" d="4900">So, if you go back to Democratus, right, the
person who originated the atomic hypothesis,</p>
<p t="160580" d="2980">Democratus actually says two things – not
one.</p>
<p t="163560" d="3520">He says: Everything's made out of atoms
– little bits of stuff.</p>
<p t="167080" d="5769">But the other thing he says is: Atoms array
themselves in space array themselves-- And</p>
<p t="172849" d="5110">what that means is that the atomic structure
of things is patterned, and that the pattern</p>
<p t="177959" d="2631">is just as real as the atoms themselves.</p>
<p t="180590" d="1770">It's the pattern that's the knowledge,
right?</p>
<p t="182360" d="4830">It's the pattern that's the information.</p>
<p t="187190" d="8750">So, what we encounter as conscious beings
is this complexly patterned array, which we</p>
<p t="195940" d="2580">then turn into knowledge – useable knowledge.</p>
<p t="198520" d="4160">I said: Well, how would this metaphorical
representation work?</p>
<p t="202680" d="4580">And so uh, the way I want you to look at this
figure is like this: Imagine this as distant,</p>
<p t="207260" d="1850">right, as lurking in the background.</p>
<p t="209110" d="7490">So, this is the ground of all being manifesting
itself as one primordial archetype, or one,</p>
<p t="216600" d="5249">one metaph-- one standard motive metaphorical
representation.</p>
<p t="221849" d="1000">Why this figure?</p>
<p t="222849" d="3530">Well, this is complicated, I think.</p>
<p t="226379" d="6621">If you show men a picture of a beautiful woman
with her eyes averted, while you're doing</p>
<p t="233000" d="5980">a brain scan mapping of their nucleus accumbens,
nothing happens.</p>
<p t="238980" d="1210">Why is that relevant?</p>
<p t="240190" d="4659">Well, the nucleus accumbens is part of the
underlying emotional circuitry that governs</p>
<p t="244849" d="2401">approach behaviour and pleasure.</p>
<p t="247250" d="2989">And approach behaviour and pleasure are very
tightly intertwined.</p>
<p t="250239" d="5101">If you show the same man a picture of a beautiful
woman with her eyes locked on his, his nucleus</p>
<p t="255340" d="1570">accumbens will light up.</p>
<p t="256910" d="1109">Why is that?</p>
<p t="258019" d="6221">Well, it's partly because men are innately
in-- attuned to hu-- to female beauty.</p>
<p t="264240" d="1609">Female beauty has a standard form.</p>
<p t="265849" d="1931">It's replicable cross-culturally.</p>
<p t="267780" d="4840">It constitutes the average human… human
female form.</p>
<p t="272620" d="5220">But more than that, the gaze-locking is an
indication of shared attention.</p>
<p t="277840" d="4340">And it's also the indication of the initial
establishment of a shared attentional space.</p>
<p t="282180" d="4510">And it's an invitation, and that invitation
activates approach circuitry, even if it's</p>
<p t="286690" d="1000">just a picture.</p>
<p t="287690" d="4479">So, and you can see this if you walk into
any drug store, or any-any s-- any drug store</p>
<p t="292169" d="1331">that sells magazines.</p>
<p t="293500" d="1000">What do you see?</p>
<p t="294500" d="4060">Well, in the men's magazines, you see an
infinite array of beautiful women.</p>
<p t="298560" d="4700">And in the female magazines, the women's
magazines, you see an infinite array of beautiful</p>
<p t="303260" d="1000">women.</p>
<p t="304260" d="1550">Now, just exactly why is that?</p>
<p t="305810" d="3930">Well, there's something absolutely compelling
about female beauty.</p>
<p t="309740" d="3710">And then, you have to ask yourself: What the
hell does compelling mean?</p>
<p t="313450" d="6990">OK, so what compelling means is: You're
busily engaged in a goal-directed task and</p>
<p t="320440" d="5410">something happens in your peripheral vision,
so to speak, that attracts your attention.</p>
<p t="325850" d="4870">Now, that attention is attracted by processes
that are fundamentally unconscious; which</p>
<p t="330720" d="3450">means, processes that occur before you can
think.</p>
<p t="334170" d="8420">So, you can imagine a loose collection of
college-aged males having a conversation in</p>
<p t="342590" d="3079">a bar, when someone beautiful walks by.</p>
<p t="345669" d="4610">And one or more of them catch her out of the
corner of their eyes.</p>
<p t="350279" d="1731">Orientation, right?</p>
<p t="352010" d="1000">Unconscious.</p>
<p t="353010" d="1000">Why?</p>
<p t="354010" d="4860">Because there's something about that pattern
form that grips attentional systems and directs</p>
<p t="358870" d="6730">observation towards it.</p>
<p t="365600" d="1450">So then, you think: OK.</p>
<p t="367050" d="3900">Human beings are really, really complicated
pattern processors.</p>
<p t="370950" d="3990">And you think: Well, partly what we're trying
to get a handle on here is the nature of the</p>
<p t="374940" d="1000">world.</p>
<p t="375940" d="3729">And partly what we know already is that there
are aspects of the world that you can't</p>
<p t="379669" d="1961">understand always.</p>
<p t="381630" d="4490">And then, you think: Well, people are trying
to get a grip on the fact that there are parts</p>
<p t="386120" d="1300">of the world that you can't understand.</p>
<p t="387420" d="5480">So, that there's this transcendant element
to being that always escapes encapsulation.</p>
<p t="392900" d="1610">How would you represent it?</p>
<p t="394510" d="5959">Well, it's the transcendent element of things
that always attracts your attention, implicitly,</p>
<p t="400469" d="1260">beyond your control.</p>
<p t="401729" d="8041">So, loud noise or a scream, or the cry of
a baby or anything horrific, right?</p>
<p t="409770" d="4670">Blood, broken bodies…</p>
<p t="414440" d="7370">These are stimuli that are so representative
of trouble that you can't help but attend</p>
<p t="421810" d="1349">to them.</p>
<p t="423159" d="5661">And then, you can imagine that all the stimuli,
so to speak, that you can't help but attend</p>
<p t="428820" d="7750">to, can be amalgamated into representations
of… the transcendent aspect of reality.</p>
<p t="436570" d="3330">And that's what you see in this representation
right here.</p>
<p t="439900" d="9340">So, you see a weird intermingling of female
sexuality, plus some very distinct genital</p>
<p t="449240" d="1000">symbolism.</p>
<p t="450240" d="1000">Why genital?</p>
<p t="451240" d="4900">So, imagine that that's a vulval opening.</p>
<p t="456140" d="1000">Why?</p>
<p t="457140" d="4390">Before we had any scientific knowledge at
all-- let's go 10,000 years ago.</p>
<p t="461530" d="1910">What the hell's inside a body?</p>
<p t="463440" d="3060">Well, we knew that, I guess, a little bit
from hunting, right?</p>
<p t="466500" d="1820">We knew the interior of a body.</p>
<p t="468320" d="3510">What is it about the interior of a body that
allows new forms to be generated?</p>
<p t="471830" d="2920">How is it that mothers can give birth to children?</p>
<p t="474750" d="4599">How is it that one form, that's complex
and attractive and mysterious, can give rise</p>
<p t="479349" d="1501">to another form?</p>
<p t="480850" d="4569">Why is that useful knowledge from a representational
perspective?</p>
<p t="485419" d="5000">Because there's some association between
the feminine form from a metaphorical perspective,</p>
<p t="490419" d="5631">and the capacity for nature to give rise to
new forms.</p>
<p t="496050" d="5820">And then you see a representation of a typical
monstrous form that's Kali the Hindu goddess</p>
<p t="501870" d="7760">the devourer and in this representation so
she's like a more developed version of Tiamat</p>
<p t="509630" d="2700">that's a good way of thinking about her.</p>
<p t="512330" d="5870">She&#39;s not so much unspeakable anymore, you
can actually say a few things about Kali,</p>
<p t="518200" d="4860">you could say well she's like a spider because
she has 8 legs and she weaves a web of fate</p>
<p t="523060" d="4120">and you could say well her web is made out
of fire because if you get too near to her</p>
<p t="527180" d="1659">you&#39;ll burn up.</p>
<p t="528839" d="4361">And you could say she glares at you with eyes
that are unblinking and you could say she</p>
<p t="533200" d="6120">has a tongue like a tiger and you could say
that she carries weapons of destruction and</p>
<p t="539320" d="3610">has a headdress of skulls and that her hair
is on fire.</p>
<p t="542930" d="4310">And you could say that she's giving birth
to this guy as nature gives birth to human</p>
<p t="547240" d="3730">beings and is devouring him at the same time.</p>
<p t="550970" d="2200">Intestines first.</p>
<p t="553170" d="6719">And then you could say well you could imagine
that the first few people that made a representation</p>
<p t="559889" d="6261">like that shocked themselves quite badly,
right because this is a this is a representation</p>
<p t="566150" d="6629">of fear itself in a sense not exactly it's
also a representation of those stimuli that</p>
<p t="572779" d="5711">if you&#39;re human are going to make you both
afraid and compelled just like it's hard</p>
<p t="578490" d="10370">to look away from fire even if it's burning
something down, you want to have it around.</p>
<p t="588860" d="6510">Rats if you raise a rat to juvenile status
and then waft in cat odour it will completely</p>
<p t="595370" d="2969">short circuit, why?</p>
<p t="598339" d="4831">Well the rat's never seen a cat so exactly
what the hell is it responding to you think</p>
<p t="603170" d="4090">well you could say well it's not a conditioned
stimulus because the rat's never encountered</p>
<p t="607260" d="5610">a cat there&#39;s something deep in the brain
of that rat that knows something about cat</p>
<p t="612870" d="6259">odour has never encountered a cat so exactly
what is it perceiving well in some sense I</p>
<p t="619129" d="4991">think the notion that it's perceiving is
wrong it isn&#39;t perceiving, it's just going</p>
<p t="624120" d="1000">like this.</p>
<p t="625120" d="1829">That's the representation.</p>
<p t="626949" d="4931">Well with chimpanzees who are more complex
there are other stimuli that evoke exactly</p>
<p t="631880" d="2930">that kind of response chimps don't like
snakes.</p>
<p t="634810" d="5170">Dead or alive plastic rubber doesn't matter
they don't like snakes if you put one in</p>
<p t="639980" d="3839">their cage they get as far away from the snake
as they can as quickly as possible and then</p>
<p t="643819" d="1281">they look at it.</p>
<p t="645100" d="3580">Because I suppose if you&#39;re a chimpanzee even
if you don't like snakes it's a good idea</p>
<p t="648680" d="6949">to know where they are right so it's simultaneously
repelling -- Ahh snake! -- plus attractive</p>
<p t="655629" d="3201">well you better look at it and see where it's
gonna go.</p>
<p t="658830" d="5790">Chimpanzees don't like unconscious chimpanzees
so if you knock a chimpanzee out with anesthetic</p>
<p t="664620" d="4310">and you bring the body of the chimpanzee back
into the chimpanzee cage the chimps do exactly</p>
<p t="668930" d="4790">the same thing away from the body but they
look at it they don't like masks made of</p>
<p t="673720" d="1179">chimpanzee faces.</p>
<p t="674899" d="3021">Well 3 year old kids don't like masks either.</p>
<p t="677920" d="6519">there are these underlying perceptual primitive
so to speak that likely activate lower limbic</p>
<p t="684439" d="8811">mechanisms in our brains that say to us this
is a place suddenly where something that you</p>
<p t="693250" d="5399">probably do not like or will not like is very
very likely to happen so you can imagine that</p>
<p t="698649" d="6901">an environment characterized by unconscious
bodies or blood or the presence of spiders</p>
<p t="705550" d="5130">or snakes etcetera might be a place where
a primate such as yourself may encounter things</p>
<p t="710680" d="5530">that they don't know how to cope with therefore
afraid, right same with fear of the dark,</p>
<p t="716210" d="4531">and then you can imagine that the dark is
populated with all of these monsters of the</p>
<p t="720741" d="3859">unknown and you get some notion of what&#39;s
happening to children who are afraid of the</p>
<p t="724600" d="2320">dark, why are they afraid of the dark.</p>
<p t="726920" d="5109">Because in the dark which is the place you
don't know lurk things that could hurt a</p>
<p t="732029" d="1431">creature like you.</p>
<p t="733460" d="1069">What things.</p>
<p t="734529" d="6040">Well we can't exactly say, but if you give
children exposure to books and to adult conversation</p>
<p t="740569" d="6101">and the television soon those limbic structures
that are populating the darkness with unnamable</p>
<p t="746670" d="6470">fear start to populate it up with skeletons
and vampires and monsters and so forth and</p>
<p t="753140" d="1160">so on.</p>
<p t="754300" d="6229">the representational structures that the brain
is capable of generating say well fear-inducing</p>
<p t="760529" d="4310">things are like that they&#39;re bloody they&#39;re
dangerous they look like serpents they look</p>
<p t="764839" d="5471">like insects they lurk in the dark they sneak
up on you etc. all mangled together into some</p>
<p t="770310" d="3459">sort of monstrous form.</p>
<p t="773769" d="4820">Now I wanna read you a story.</p>
<p t="778589" d="4250">So lemme give you a little background on this
story.</p>
<p t="782839" d="4940">This story popped into my head in one chunk
like complete which I thought was kind of</p>
<p t="787779" d="6441">interesting but… it was also a story that
emerged in solution to a problem I'd been</p>
<p t="794220" d="3729">thinking about for a long time because I was
dealing with this guy who didn&#39;t wanna grow</p>
<p t="797949" d="6061">up, so he's caught in a kind of Peter Pan
situation and Peter Pan, pan means everything,</p>
<p t="804010" d="2059">pan like pantheistic.</p>
<p t="806069" d="4390">And Peter Pan is a child who won't grow
up now he's magical well okay fine children</p>
<p t="810459" d="4060">live in the magical world right they&#39;re ripe
with possibility, he's magical.</p>
<p t="814519" d="2831">He doesn't wanna grow up.</p>
<p t="817350" d="4230">So he lives in Neverland with the lost boys,
Neverland doesn't really exist and the lost</p>
<p t="821580" d="5710">boys are obviously boys who haven&#39;t managed
to establish some mode of being and he's</p>
<p t="827290" d="6180">in constant battle with Capt. Hook and Capt.
Hook's a tyrant right a pirate a negative</p>
<p t="833470" d="3529">a manifestation of the negative archetype
of social order.</p>
<p t="836999" d="5650">Hook is always fighting Peter Pan because
Peter Pan represents childhood and vulnerability</p>
<p t="842649" d="3690">and he doesn't wanna be vulnerable so they&#39;re
locked in this sort of eternal battle.</p>
<p t="846339" d="8610">and lots of people I think more commonly men
but not necessarily, get caught in this Peter</p>
<p t="854949" d="1700">Pan problem</p>
<p t="856649" d="7411">So I was dealing with a person who was caught
in this situation didn&#39;t wanna grow up wouldn't</p>
<p t="864060" d="3209">sacrifice childhood.</p>
<p t="867269" d="2021">And so this story popped into my head.</p>
<p t="869290" d="2549">It's called Cockadoodledo</p>
<p t="871839" d="4160">Once upon a time there was a man who had a
long hard journey ahead of him.</p>
<p t="875999" d="3880">He was trudging along the way over waters
and through brushes when he saw little shiny</p>
<p t="879879" d="4960">gnome with big white teeth and a black toupee
sitting by the side of the road.</p>
<p t="884839" d="1821">He was drumming on a log.</p>
<p t="886660" d="2719">With two white bones and humming oddly to
himself.</p>
<p t="889379" d="6460">The little gnome said John, why work so hard
why walk so fast.</p>
<p t="895839" d="1800">Who knows if you&#39;ll ever get there anyway.</p>
<p t="897639" d="3180">Come over here I have something to show you.</p>
<p t="900819" d="1671">So John walked off the road.</p>
<p t="902490" d="4440">He was sick of walking anyway because people
kept throwing sticks and stones at him.</p>
<p t="906930" d="5200">Little gnome said I have a shiny red jewel
that I would like to sell you.</p>
<p t="912130" d="1100">Cheap.</p>
<p t="913230" d="1810">Here it is.</p>
<p t="915040" d="3870">And from beneath his cloak he pulled the biggest
ruby that the man had ever seen.</p>
<p t="918910" d="4520">Must've weighed 100 pounds and shone like
the sun.</p>
<p t="923430" d="2040">The gnome said, do you like it.</p>
<p t="925470" d="4479">It's an enchanted stone, what will you offer
me for it.</p>
<p t="929949" d="1000">And the man said.</p>
<p t="930949" d="4271">I don't have much, much money but I'll
give you everything I have.</p>
<p t="935220" d="2359">And the gnome looked displeased.</p>
<p t="937579" d="3810">So John added I could pay some more monthly.</p>
<p t="941389" d="5281">So the gnome accepted, fair enough buy now
pay later, sounds good for me, I&#39;m all for</p>
<p t="946670" d="2330">the installment plan.</p>
<p t="949000" d="3740">So the man gave the gnome all his money and
promised to pay the rest later and the gnome</p>
<p t="952740" d="5039">walked back into the bush by the road clacking
his teeth and giggling and twitching.</p>
<p t="957779" d="5060">The more the man thought about this ruby and
the great deal he got the happier he became,</p>
<p t="962839" d="3620">he started back on the road with a light heart
but soon discovered that he couldn&#39;t make</p>
<p t="966459" d="3771">much progress because 100 pounds was a lot
to carry.</p>
<p t="970230" d="4969">He said to himself why continue anyways I
have what I want, I'll just stand here holding</p>
<p t="975199" d="5330">my ruby and when people walk by they could
see how well I&#39;ve all ready done.</p>
<p t="980529" d="1530">So he stopped.</p>
<p t="982059" d="3590">A little while one of his little while later
one of his friends came along saw him standing</p>
<p t="985649" d="1000">there.</p>
<p t="986649" d="3531">His friend said John why don't you come
along with me.</p>
<p t="990180" d="4620">I&#39;ve just opened a new business and I could
really use some help, come along quick.</p>
<p t="994800" d="2300">It will be opening soon.</p>
<p t="997100" d="1399">John thought that sounded good.</p>
<p t="998499" d="1820">But his friend was in a hurry.</p>
<p t="1000319" d="2620">Besides couldn&#39;t he see the ruby?</p>
<p t="1002939" d="4210">How could he speed along beside him where
would he put his jewel.</p>
<p t="1007149" d="2091">So he said thanks but I have to take care
of my jewel.</p>
<p t="1009240" d="1959">Maybe I'll see you later.</p>
<p t="1011199" d="4080">His friend looked at him like he was crazy
but he was trying to get somewhere quick so</p>
<p t="1015279" d="3781">he just shrugged a bit and said okay John
see you later.</p>
<p t="1019060" d="2170">And he sped on down the road.</p>
<p t="1021230" d="3430">Little while later another friend came by
and he said John nice to see you.</p>
<p t="1024660" d="1149">I&#39;m going back to school.</p>
<p t="1025809" d="3941">There are lots of wonderful things to learn,
great things to do.</p>
<p t="1029750" d="2050">The world is full of unsolved problems.</p>
<p t="1031800" d="1690">I could use some company.</p>
<p t="1033490" d="2150">Would you like to come along.</p>
<p t="1035640" d="3980">John thought that sounded pretty good but
this friend too looked like he was in a hurry.</p>
<p t="1039620" d="3540">Besides standing beside the road holding the
jewel was tiring and he needed all the energy</p>
<p t="1043160" d="1500">he had for that.</p>
<p t="1044660" d="4040">So he said to his friend thanks but I have
to take care of my jewel.</p>
<p t="1048700" d="3170">Isn&#39;t it beautiful maybe I'll see you later.</p>
<p t="1051870" d="3790">His friend looked at him like he was crazy
but he was trying to get somewhere quick so</p>
<p t="1055660" d="6680">he just shrugged and said hope everything
goes all right with you, see you later.</p>
<p t="1062340" d="2500">Many friends came and went and the years went
by.</p>
<p t="1064840" d="2360">The jewel got heavier and heavier.</p>
<p t="1067200" d="2100">But the man got more and more attached to
it.</p>
<p t="1069300" d="3840">The only thing was nobody seemed to notice
how beautiful it was.</p>
<p t="1073140" d="4630">People would rush by and talk about their
plans and nobody had a ruby as big and nobody</p>
<p t="1077770" d="5330">seemed likely to get a ruby as big if you&#39;d
think that someone might have said something</p>
<p t="1083100" d="6890">like at least nice ruby John sure wish I had
one like that but it never happened.</p>
<p t="1089990" d="4010">Then one day someone new came down the road,
he was bent over and he was thin and his hair</p>
<p t="1094000" d="2460">was gray, although he didn&#39;t look that old.</p>
<p t="1096460" d="5160">He was carrying a big dirty rock carefully
in his arms and he wasn't making much progress.</p>
<p t="1101620" d="4919">The strange figure approached and glanced
up at John, then he grinned and said, why</p>
<p t="1106539" d="4451">are you standing there so stupidly with a
big ugly rock in your tired old hands.</p>
<p t="1110990" d="1160">You look pretty daft.</p>
<p t="1112150" d="4909">I bet you wish you had a big ruby like the
one I&#39;m carrying and John thought this poor</p>
<p t="1117059" d="3481">man is deluded, he's carrying a rock.</p>
<p t="1120540" d="3980">I have the ruby so he said excuse me sir but
you were sadly mistaken.</p>
<p t="1124520" d="4340">I&#39;m the one with the jewel I met a little
gnome by the side of the road and he sold</p>
<p t="1128860" d="1000">it to me.</p>
<p t="1129860" d="2670">I'm still paying for it.</p>
<p t="1132530" d="4020">Although not so very much, you are carrying
a rock.</p>
<p t="1136550" d="3930">The tired stranger looked annoyed said I don&#39;t
know what game you&#39;re playing mister you have</p>
<p t="1140480" d="2740">a rock I have a jewel.</p>
<p t="1143220" d="2120">Little gnome you described sold it to me.</p>
<p t="1145340" d="1620">And he said it was the only one.</p>
<p t="1146960" d="2790">I&#39;ve been carrying it for 20 years.</p>
<p t="1149750" d="2120">And I'll never let it go.</p>
<p t="1151870" d="5000">And John said but I&#39;m been carrying mine for
20 years too, it can't be just a rock.</p>
<p t="1156870" d="3050">Rock or jewel on and on they argued.</p>
<p t="1159920" d="2889">Suddenly out stepped the little gnome as if
he'd never left.</p>
<p t="1162809" d="3781">Only this time he wasn't so little he was
bigger and redder and menacing and his laugh</p>
<p t="1166590" d="3140">sounded like the rattling of chains.</p>
<p t="1169730" d="1740">Quit arguing you two.</p>
<p t="1171470" d="2610">I&#39;ve never seen a sight quite so pathetic.</p>
<p t="1174080" d="2800">You&#39;re carrying rocks, both of you.</p>
<p t="1176880" d="4120">And if you would&#39;ve ever had the sense to
put them down for a second or two you would&#39;ve</p>
<p t="1181000" d="1210">seen that.</p>
<p t="1182210" d="2490">Oh well at least you were diligent.</p>
<p t="1184700" d="1829">I played a mean trick.</p>
<p t="1186529" d="2030">I feel bad.</p>
<p t="1188559" d="2631">So I&#39;m gonna give you what you really deserve.</p>
<p t="1191190" d="3760">Do you want what you really deserve?</p>
<p t="1194950" d="4420">And John and the thin stranger nodded eagerly,
finally they thought.</p>
<p t="1199370" d="2240">You haven&#39;t seen anything yet.</p>
<p t="1201610" d="1850">Throw down your rocks.</p>
<p t="1203460" d="2469">So John and the thin stranger obeyed.</p>
<p t="1205929" d="4970">Each rock split down the middle and it hit
the ground, out flowed a river of ravenous</p>
<p t="1210899" d="4971">white worms which rushed towards the men and
devoured them whole while they thrashed about</p>
<p t="1215870" d="2320">and screamed.</p>
<p t="1218190" d="4290">Soon nothing was left except a legbone from
each.</p>
<p t="1222480" d="3170">The little gnome picked them up and walked
off the road.</p>
<p t="1225650" d="3129">He sat down by a hollow log and started to
drum.</p>
<p t="1228779" d="2120">He drummed and he waited.</p>
<p t="1230899" d="3961">And he hummed an odd little tune.</p>
<p t="1234860" d="6030">Picture of food feeds the whole hungry clan,
the image of good makes the whole healthy</p>
<p t="1240890" d="9629">man, why walk for miles why do the work, just
smile the smile, success after all is a quirk,</p>
<p t="1250519" d="2801">life isn&#39;t real that's the message I give.</p>
<p t="1253320" d="10230">It's easy that way, plus who wants to live?</p>
<p t="1263550" d="4650">So needless to say the guy that I was telling
this story to never listened to it and things</p>
<p t="1268200" d="4650">really didn&#39;t go well for him for a long,
long time, and they really didn&#39;t go well</p>
<p t="1272850" d="4760">for him until he was willing to give up some
of the things he was carrying along so he</p>
<p t="1277610" d="5580">had acquired for example a number of things
that he couldn&#39;t afford.</p>
<p t="1283190" d="4310">And the fact that he was carrying them right
paying for them month after month, meant couldn&#39;t</p>
<p t="1287500" d="4870">afford to get an education was perfectly willing
to sacrifice the possibility of getting an</p>
<p t="1292370" d="2980">education for the image of success.</p>
<p t="1295350" d="5340">Rather than the reverse right and he was completely
irritated at the world because he had all</p>
<p t="1300690" d="5950">these trappings of success which no one he
admired also admired and he absolutely wasn't</p>
<p t="1306640" d="3720">getting anywhere and he thought that was tremendously
unfair.</p>
<p t="1310360" d="4789">But the truth of the matter was that had he
put down what he was carrying for even a moment</p>
<p t="1315149" d="2841">and he would&#39;ve been able to get to where
he wanted to go.</p>
<p t="1317990" d="12680">And that's a motif that succinctly and dramatically
describes the necessity for sacrifice.</p>
<p t="1330670" d="9000">Now one of the things you see in psycho therapy
very very commonly is that the person who's</p>
<p t="1339670" d="7070">coming for help does the same damn thing over
and over and over and every time they do it,</p>
<p t="1346740" d="2200">it has the same consequence.</p>
<p t="1348940" d="1010">Bad.</p>
<p t="1349950" d="4780">So they end up with the same kind of they
end up in the same kind of relationship.</p>
<p t="1354730" d="4449">Right starts out well then the person turns
against them and starts to abuse them they</p>
<p t="1359179" d="3911">get abused repeatedly then it ends then they
meet someone else and the cycle continues</p>
<p t="1363090" d="3339">doesn't seem to matter who they&#39;re out with
either they pick a person like this or they</p>
<p t="1366429" d="5011">turn the person into someone like that they
lose jobs the same way or their educational</p>
<p t="1371440" d="6460">hopes fail the same way, why, well the person
thinks man… the structure of the world is</p>
<p t="1377900" d="4690">so unfair everyone else seems to be getting
along just fine but me I get hit in the head</p>
<p t="1382590" d="1010">over and over.</p>
<p t="1383600" d="6640">Exactly the same way and then you think well…
what is the structure of the world, exactly</p>
<p t="1390240" d="5490">and then you remember well you know there&#39;s
the things you don't understand and the</p>
<p t="1395730" d="5579">things you do understand and the things you
do understand structure you and protect you</p>
<p t="1401309" d="6370">but you know sometimes the things you do understand
aren&#39;t the right things, you&#39;re valuing something</p>
<p t="1407679" d="4661">you&#39;re carrying something that's an impediment
to your further progress and it's frequently</p>
<p t="1412340" d="4740">the case that it's the kind of impediment
that under no conditions do you wanna give</p>
<p t="1417080" d="4870">up because there&#39;s something about you that
says like John says about the ruby, look,</p>
<p t="1421950" d="5209">it's a ruby, who the hell cares if it weighs
100 pounds and I have to stand by the road</p>
<p t="1427159" d="4641">I still got the ruby, and all you&#39;d ever have
to do is put the damn thing down and wander</p>
<p t="1431800" d="2009">off and everything would be just fine</p>
<p t="1433809" d="2691">but you won't do it, why.</p>
<p t="1436500" d="1809">Because you don't wanna give up what you
know.</p>
<p t="1438309" d="2691">Because you don't wanna sacrifice anything.</p>
<p t="1441000" d="5460">Well, long before people had any psychological
acumen or any psychological knowledge they</p>
<p t="1446460" d="6449">all ready figured out that if you were gonna
take on a figure like this and expect to get</p>
<p t="1452909" d="5911">absolutely anywhere with her right the horrors
of the world, you bloody well better be willing</p>
<p t="1458820" d="4810">to sacrifice whatever's necessary to keep
you going along your path right unfortunately</p>
<p t="1463630" d="5279">the things that you have to sacrifice are
often those things that you&#39;re most particularly</p>
<p t="1468909" d="4911">compelled by or gripped by or value the things
that you wanna give up least.</p>
<p t="1473820" d="9120">Which is why in archaic societies where all
this is dramatized people sacrifice an animal</p>
<p t="1482940" d="3609">that they value particularly.</p>
<p t="1486549" d="6661">Or eerier than that even a child that they
value particularly right dramatically portraying</p>
<p t="1493210" d="6100">the idea of sacrifice you have to give something
up if you wanna make an inroad on what she</p>
<p t="1499310" d="1920">represents.</p>
<p t="1501230" d="6030">And so then you say the purpose of sacrifice
is to turn the terrible aspect of the world</p>
<p t="1507260" d="7060">into the benevolent aspect of the world and
this is Diana not a Hindu goddess but a Greek</p>
<p t="1514320" d="9709">a Roman goddess same idea applies in the Hindu
case if you make the appropriate sacrifices</p>
<p t="1524029" d="5900">then the terrible aspect of the world turns
into the benevolent aspect of the world.</p>
<p t="1529929" d="4591">And it is the case that even empirical studies
of success indicate that intelligence is a</p>
<p t="1534520" d="4550">handy thing to have, but hard work and dedication
is a handy thing to have too and what that</p>
<p t="1539070" d="5579">means is that you&#39;re constantly willing to
sacrifice the impulsive pleasure of the present</p>
<p t="1544649" d="2681">for the hopes of payback in the future.</p>
<p t="1547330" d="5160">For example the sacrifice immediate gratification
to obtain an appropriate social role take</p>
<p t="1552490" d="1200">your place in society.</p>
<p t="1553690" d="5949">It's definitely a sacrifice right because
you put off pleasures in the moment to obtain</p>
<p t="1559639" d="3461">long term stability and productivity.</p>
<p t="1563100" d="7299">To turn the world into this.</p>
<p t="1570399" d="7221">And so then you can say, this is how the world
falls apart as it's explored right so first</p>
<p t="1577620" d="4390">of all there&#39;s the thing that you can't
even name that only fills you with dread and</p>
<p t="1582010" d="5720">but also with the sense of possibility and
that manifests itself in your life as something</p>
<p t="1587730" d="1000">concrete.</p>
<p t="1588730" d="4699">That you don't know promising and threatening
and that divides itself up into those aspects</p>
<p t="1593429" d="5461">of the world that you value and admire and
that hold promise for you, and those aspects</p>
<p t="1598890" d="6050">of the world that don't and that's a differentiation
as a consequence of exploration.</p>
<p t="1604940" d="4989">It's not a differentiation of the world
into objects though it's a differentiation</p>
<p t="1609929" d="5531">of the world into categories of emotion, those
things that are good for you those things</p>
<p t="1615460" d="3560">that are bad for you and the source that they&#39;re
derived from.</p>
<p t="1619020" d="2269">That's the background of the world.</p>
<p t="1621289" d="1240">We&#39;ll stop!</p>
