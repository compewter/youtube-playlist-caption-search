<p t="5120" d="10399">Well, after all that. So, welcome to Psychology
230. Nice to see you all here. So, what I’m</p>
<p t="15519" d="4381">going to do today—how I’m going to start—is
I’m going to give you an overview of the</p>
<p t="19900" d="5240">content of the course and then I’ll give
you an overview of the class requirements</p>
<p t="25140" d="4070">right at the end. But I think we might as
well jump right into the content to begin</p>
<p t="29210" d="840">with.</p>
<p t="30050" d="7200">So, there’s a website—I don’t really
like Blackboard so I have my own website.</p>
<p t="37250" d="8070">You can go to jordanbpeterson.com and underneath
there there’s a menu that lists all the</p>
<p t="45320" d="5379">courses and the full syllabus is listed there.
So, all the information that you’re going</p>
<p t="50699" d="4360">to need about the course can be found there,
including most of the readings, although there</p>
<p t="55059" d="7350">is also a textbook, which I presume the majority
of you have already purchased. So, it also</p>
<p t="62409" d="4791">lists the other things you need to know like
what days the tests are going to be and what</p>
<p t="67200" d="7300">the assignments are and I’ll go over that
anyways at the end of the class. So, but to</p>
<p t="74500" d="3660">begin with I’m going to tell you what the
course is about so you can decide whether</p>
<p t="78160" d="6120">you’re in the right class or not.</p>
<p t="84280" d="11210">So, personality is a somewhat peculiar field
of study in psychology because it spans a</p>
<p t="95490" d="10480">number of subdisciplines that aren’t particularly
well suited to one another. So, for example,</p>
<p t="105970" d="10530">it spans clinical psychology and experimental
psychology. And it also spans an approach</p>
<p t="116500" d="10170">that is associated fundamentally with single
individuals with an approach that analyzes</p>
<p t="126670" d="5649">individual characteristics in large groups,
which is generally what you have to do in</p>
<p t="132319" d="9980">experimental psychology. It’s also a relatively
strange admixture of philosophy and, I would</p>
<p t="142299" d="7860">say engineering and medicine, as well as science.
And you might think of medicine as a science</p>
<p t="150159" d="4961">but it’s not, and the reason that it’s
not is because it’s concerned with the promotion</p>
<p t="155120" d="5539">of health and health is not a scientific category.
It’s a category that can’t help but be</p>
<p t="160659" d="6470">value-laden because you have to decide what constitutes
health and what constitutes illness, or what</p>
<p t="167129" d="4071">constitutes wellness and what constitutes
pathology. And there’s no way you can do</p>
<p t="171200" d="2489">that without bringing value judgments into
the equation.</p>
<p t="173689" d="5401">It’s particularly true in psychology because
when you’re thinking about what a healthy</p>
<p t="179090" d="5379">personality might be, you generally don’t
merely think in terms of the absence of pathology.</p>
<p t="184469" d="5080">You think in terms of the presence of positive
traits, right, and someone who’s fully healthy</p>
<p t="189549" d="4860">mentally and physically. While the psychologists
and especially the humanistic psychologists</p>
<p t="194409" d="4810">from the 60’s might consider someone who’s
truly psychologically healthy self-actualized,</p>
<p t="199219" d="4211">which would mean in some sense that they’ve
been able to develop the entirety of their</p>
<p t="203430" d="9020">positive potential, whatever that is. So because
of these peculiarities, personality psychology</p>
<p t="212450" d="5819">the course, a course in personality psychology
has to be pretty wide-ranging. And so this</p>
<p t="218269" d="8791">course is in fact wide-ranging. It brings
in elements of cultural history, elements</p>
<p t="227060" d="7969">of moral philosophy, and then elements that
I would consider are almost completely biological.</p>
<p t="235029" d="5990">And it does that in order to provide you with
a multidimensional view of what it means to</p>
<p t="241019" d="1200">be a human being.</p>
<p t="242219" d="4550">I have some other principles that I abide
by while I’m teaching this course as well</p>
<p t="246769" d="5090">and one of those is that I don’t really
want to tell you about anything that I don’t</p>
<p t="251859" d="5940">you will find useful. And useful, like there’s
a difference between a fact and a useful fact,</p>
<p t="257799" d="4071">right? There’s lots of facts, you can go
on Google and you can drown yourself in facts—I’m</p>
<p t="261870" d="6290">sure you do that everyday. But a useful fact
to me is one that transforms the way that</p>
<p t="268160" d="5229">you look at the world or the way that you
act in the world in some manner that you find</p>
<p t="273389" d="7631">beneficial. And so another way of describing
useful from that perspective is relevant.</p>
<p t="281020" d="3720">And so one of the principles I abide by is
I don’t really want to teach you anything</p>
<p t="284740" d="6810">that isn’t relevant. And my criteria for
relevant is, first: Is it going to make a</p>
<p t="291550" d="4450">difference to you personally. So are the things
that you learn immediately meaningful to how</p>
<p t="296000" d="5509">you interact with the world? And then the
second is: Is there some evidence that the</p>
<p t="301509" d="4821">facts that you’re going to be presented
with actually have some social utility or</p>
<p t="306330" d="4630">some political utility or some economic utility?
So that the fact that you know them makes</p>
<p t="310960" d="5820">a difference to the way that you act in a
way that also affects the people around you.</p>
<p t="316780" d="9289">And so it’s for those multiple reasons that
I brought together the material that I have</p>
<p t="326069" d="731">brought together.</p>
<p t="326800" d="7850">Now that means that there are some factors
that you have to take into account before</p>
<p t="334650" d="5350">you take this course. And there’s another
personality course being given at exactly</p>
<p t="340000" d="4659">the same time, well I don’t—this semester
anyways—and so it may be that that one is</p>
<p t="344659" d="3421">more suitable for you than this one. I don’t
know, but I can tell you what this one is</p>
<p t="348080" d="4209">going to be like. And so if that isn’t what
you want or if that’s not what you’re</p>
<p t="352289" d="4011">interested in then you probably shouldn’t
take this course. So the first issue is that</p>
<p t="356300" d="4179">there’s a lot of reading. There isn’t
as much reading as there used to be in this</p>
<p t="360479" d="6430">course, by the way, but there’s still a
lot of reading and a lot of it’s original</p>
<p t="366909" d="6111">source material both from the personality
theorists themselves and then also original</p>
<p t="373020" d="4850">source material from empirical papers. So
I would say that not only is there a lot of</p>
<p t="377870" d="5560">reading, but the reading is actually quite
difficult. I think it’s useful, given the</p>
<p t="383430" d="5540">way I already defined utility to you, and
so I believe that reading what I present to</p>
<p t="388970" d="5390">you is going to be good for you, but if you
don’t have time to do a lot of reading then</p>
<p t="394360" d="3200">you’re going to find this course frustrating.</p>
<p t="397560" d="7750">So, there’s also, because of the emphasis
on clinical theoreticians which is a major</p>
<p t="405310" d="5520">part of personality theory—especially the
more classical personality theory, which by</p>
<p t="410830" d="4119">the way is generally the elements of personality
theory that most students are most interested</p>
<p t="414949" d="6041">in—there’s a lot of what I would consider
philosophical material. And the reason it’s</p>
<p t="420990" d="5859">philosophical is because it’s concerned
with how a person should live and that’s</p>
<p t="426849" d="4070">a much different question than what a person
is. So it’s how a person should live or</p>
<p t="430919" d="5131">perhaps how a person might transform themselves
or act in order to transform themselves so</p>
<p t="436050" d="6040">that there personality is, well for lack of
a better term, better. Now, you can substitute</p>
<p t="442090" d="4699">healthier for better but in a context like
the one we’re discussing the difference</p>
<p t="446789" d="2581">is trivial really.</p>
<p t="449370" d="6410">So, then the last thing that I would caution
you against is that I don’t lecture from</p>
<p t="455780" d="6669">the reading material. So, often I’m not exactly
sure even what I’m going to tell you when</p>
<p t="462449" d="8111">I come to class. I know the material, but I
don’t what to stick to a prescribed outline;</p>
<p t="470560" d="4870">I want to talk to you about the things that
I think are important. And so, with luck,</p>
<p t="475430" d="6780">that’ll make the lectures worth attending
and worth listening to. But, if you’re more</p>
<p t="482210" d="5269">inclined from a temperamental perspective
to want a course where things are laid out</p>
<p t="487479" d="4400">in a very orderly fashion and they progress
in a linear fashion and it’s predictable</p>
<p t="491879" d="5410">and the lectures reflect the reading material,
then this is not a good course for you. And</p>
<p t="497289" d="4891">so I would presume that would be the case
if you’re orderly, and by the way, that’s</p>
<p t="502180" d="5180">one of the subdivisions of the Big Five Personality
Trait Model, and orderly people tend to be</p>
<p t="507360" d="5830">conscientious. But they like things cut and
dried and laid out in a linear fashion. I’m</p>
<p t="513190" d="7310">not that orderly; I’m higher in openness
and openness is a creative dimension. And</p>
<p t="520500" d="6160">open people tend to use relatively loose associations
when they speak and to cover a wide amount</p>
<p t="526660" d="6030">of territory. And, so, some people will like
that. If you like reading literature, for</p>
<p t="532690" d="5699">example, you’d probably like this course.
If you don’t, then you probably won’t.</p>
<p t="538389" d="7591">So, anyways, that’s pretty much enough for
the warnings. So, now I’ll tell you what</p>
<p t="545980" d="6090">we’re going to talk about.</p>
<p t="552070" d="9340">One of the things that makes human beings
unique is the fact that we’re self-conscious.</p>
<p t="561410" d="6190">Now, you’ll see ethologists, or people who
study animal behavior, do relatively elementary</p>
<p t="567600" d="6350">tests of self-consciousness on animals. So,
one of the most famous demonstrations of such</p>
<p t="573950" d="4639">self-consciousness is the mirror test. And
so in the mirror test what you essentially</p>
<p t="578589" d="6281">do is you take an animals, maybe a chimp or
maybe a three year old child, and you put</p>
<p t="584870" d="4570">a lipstick mark on their forehead or on their
nose and then you show them a reflection of</p>
<p t="589440" d="5570">themselves in the mirror. And if they wipe
off or gesture towards the lipstick mark then</p>
<p t="595010" d="4590">can make the presumption that they understand
that it’s them that’s being reflected</p>
<p t="599600" d="4870">in the mirror, or at least they understand
that well enough so that they can use the</p>
<p t="604470" d="6660">mirror as a guide to action with their hand
or whatever it is that they happen to be pointing</p>
<p t="611130" d="5399">with and the reflection. Now, dolphins seem
to be able to manage that, there’s some</p>
<p t="616529" d="4631">members of the corvid family, so those are
basically crows and ravens—those things</p>
<p t="621160" d="5660">are really smart and they seem to possess
rudimentary self-consciousness—I said dolphins,</p>
<p t="626820" d="4870">cetaceans in general, so whales—although
I don’t know if all whales are self-conscious</p>
<p t="631690" d="5449">because it’s for example difficult to get
a mirror big enough to show a blue whale—human</p>
<p t="637139" d="10450">beings, and that’s about it. Now, I don’t
think that’s a very good definition of self-consciousness</p>
<p t="647589" d="3831">really, because the mere fact that you can
recognize yourself, it’s also not fair to</p>
<p t="651420" d="5010">some animals like dogs, right, because dogs
would need a smell mirror really, because,</p>
<p t="656430" d="7500">and most animals are very very smell predicated.
Most of the brain is structured with the olfactory</p>
<p t="663930" d="4390">system as its core, unlike us really because
our brains are structured with the visual</p>
<p t="668320" d="4340">system at the core and that makes us rather
peculiar. So it’s a little unfair to animals</p>
<p t="672660" d="4750">like dogs or any rats that rely primarily
on olfaction to orient themselves in the world.</p>
<p t="677410" d="3810">But the thing is I don’t think that’s
really a very good definition of self-consciousness;</p>
<p t="681220" d="1619">it’s very rudimentary.</p>
<p t="682839" d="5031">You might say well that’s the first sort
of step to being self-conscious because if</p>
<p t="687870" d="4149">you’re fully self-conscious I think you
need to two more things. You need the capacity</p>
<p t="692019" d="6000">to imitate, which is a much more important
capacity than people generally realize. In</p>
<p t="698019" d="7120">fact, I would say it’s of equivalent importance—it’s
of equivalent importance to language. In fact,</p>
<p t="705139" d="4731">I’m not even sure that you can use language
if you can’t imitate. First of all, obviously</p>
<p t="709870" d="4920">all the words you use are also the words that
other people use. Otherwise, you’re not</p>
<p t="714790" d="4549">going to be very comprehensible. So, even the
mere fact that you do speak means that you’re</p>
<p t="719339" d="5981">relying on imitation to get your point across.
So, you need imitation and the reason you need</p>
<p t="725320" d="5240">imitation is because once you can imitate,
you can use your body as a representational</p>
<p t="730560" d="5529">structure to represent the world and other
people. You can even use your body as a representational</p>
<p t="736089" d="3761">structure to represent yourself, which you
might do, for example, if you’re telling</p>
<p t="739850" d="6220">a joke at a dinner party and then you, you
know, act out a self-parody and everyone laughs.</p>
<p t="746070" d="5810">So, and then with regards to language, well
language obviously enables you to build sophisticated</p>
<p t="751880" d="4730">models of the world that are well-articulated,
to exchange those with other people, and to</p>
<p t="756610" d="539">think.</p>
<p t="757149" d="5401">Ok so, in order to be self-conscious you have
to be able to recognize that you exist in</p>
<p t="762550" d="5779">this physical envelope, at least here and
now; you need to be able to imitate, because</p>
<p t="768329" d="4620">that’s partly how you come to understand
yourself and other creatures like you, which</p>
<p t="772949" d="4820">is a very important part of being self-conscious,
right—I mean everything I learn about any</p>
<p t="777769" d="4581">of you is also going help me understand the
sort of creature that I am, whether that’s</p>
<p t="782350" d="6940">for good or for evil—and then with language,
well not only can we articulate our representations</p>
<p t="789290" d="4760">about others in the world, but we can also
store those articulated representations over</p>
<p t="794050" d="6149">very very very very long spans of time. And
we do that partly in ritual, which is the</p>
<p t="800199" d="5080">acting out of a representation, and we do
that partly with regards to stories, which</p>
<p t="805279" d="5881">are in some sense an articulated representation
of an acting out, right, because you can think</p>
<p t="811160" d="6919">of a story as a drama. So a drama is behavior
representing behavior and then a story is</p>
<p t="818079" d="7421">an articulated representation of a drama.
Now we have very old rituals and we have very</p>
<p t="825500" d="6490">very old stories. And so, part of what we
do in this course is we go back to as close</p>
<p t="831990" d="5339">to the beginning as we can possibly manage
to start to understand how people have understood</p>
<p t="837329" d="5961">themselves and represented themselves across
the span of human history. And we’re doing</p>
<p t="843290" d="4779">that because we want to be able to put our
current knowledge in some kind of historical</p>
<p t="848069" d="520">context.</p>
<p t="848589" d="6081">And part of the reason for that is, well one
of the things that characterizes a human personality</p>
<p t="854670" d="5159">is that it’s a historical phenomena. You
know I’m sure you’ve heard in many classes</p>
<p t="859829" d="6200">that much of what makes up your personality
is a cultural construct. Well, whether or</p>
<p t="866029" d="3980">not much of it is or not isn’t really the
issue. Certainly some of it is, and an important</p>
<p t="870009" d="4681">part—you’re a cultural creature. And that
means that you have emerged from a tradition</p>
<p t="874690" d="6690">that has been shaped in any number of ways
by an extraordinary lengthy historical past—well</p>
<p t="881380" d="7030">historical and biological. And so what that
means in part is that if you don’t understand</p>
<p t="888410" d="7080">your history, and that’s your history as
it matters, not necessarily some collection</p>
<p t="895490" d="6200">of facts, then you don’t understand yourself.
So, you know, human beings in their self-conscious</p>
<p t="901690" d="7060">form, we don’t really know how old we are.
More or less biologically or genetically identical</p>
<p t="908750" d="6500">creatures to us existed at least 150 000 years
ago but we seem to have discovered fire and</p>
<p t="915250" d="5259">were able to master it maybe 2 million years
ago. You know and that requires a fair bit</p>
<p t="920509" d="10411">of intelligence. And there are artifacts that
indicate a fairly high level of cultural capacity</p>
<p t="930920" d="5669">that are at least 50 000 years old. So, we
can’t really say when we got fully self-conscious,</p>
<p t="936589" d="4221">and perhaps we might also say that we’re
not even fully self-conscious yet because</p>
<p t="940810" d="3279">you know, really, what the hell do you know
about yourself. You know, you’re really</p>
<p t="944089" d="5271">really really really complicated. And at best
you have a partial model of who you are and</p>
<p t="949360" d="3539">that thing fails all the tail, which as you
can tell because you’re always doing things</p>
<p t="952899" d="7201">that surprise you and often not in a particularly
positive way. So, there’s no end of mystery.</p>
<p t="960100" d="7310">Anyways, the upshot of all of this is that
we’re going to establish the context first</p>
<p t="967410" d="5000">that’s a historical context and I want to
do that two ways. The first thing I want to</p>
<p t="972410" d="6719">do is to talk to you about mythological representations
of personality. And that’s more important</p>
<p t="979129" d="7320">than you might think. In fact, it’s probably
more important than you do think. By myth,</p>
<p t="986449" d="9241">what I mean is the representations of human
beings in extremely long-lasting and persistent</p>
<p t="995690" d="6110">stories. And so some of those are the stories
that are found in various religious traditions,</p>
<p t="1001800" d="3349">but there’s oral traditions that surround
those religious traditions, you know assuming</p>
<p t="1005149" d="4440">that the religious traditions are written
down; and there’s fairy tales and that sort</p>
<p t="1009589" d="5141">of thing; and standard narratives that people
used to guide themselves as the moved through</p>
<p t="1014730" d="7289">the world. And most of the clinical theories
that we’re going to discuss, so Freud’s</p>
<p t="1022019" d="3851">theory and Jung’s theory and the theory
of the Existentialists and the Phenomenologists</p>
<p t="1025870" d="5650">and the Humanists and so forth, are variants
of those mythological stories.</p>
<p t="1031520" d="6039">Now, part of the reason for that is that Nietzsche
said once that a philosopher was seldom anything</p>
<p t="1037559" d="8000">other than the unconscious advocate of their
cultural worldview. So, what he meant by that</p>
<p t="1045559" d="5391">was you already come to the scene with a set
of presuppositions. Now, some of those are</p>
<p t="1050950" d="4089">embedded in your behavior. So, for example,
when you walk—when you attend a funeral</p>
<p t="1055039" d="3880">you know how to behavior. Generally, you’re
quiet and solemn. You might not be able to</p>
<p t="1058919" d="6081">explicate the rules a person should follow
at a funeral, but you can do it. Now, you could</p>
<p t="1065000" d="4350">perhaps articulate them if pressed, but it’s
not like you’re following those rules when</p>
<p t="1069350" d="4090">you go to a funeral; you just know what to
do. If someone pressed you, you could turn</p>
<p t="1073440" d="5260">it into a list of rules but it’s really
more encoded in you’re actual behavior.</p>
<p t="1078700" d="4330">You just automatically know what to do. You
can tell, you know, whenever you interact</p>
<p t="1083030" d="5250">with someone who’s really socially fluent,
you can tell that they’re not consciously</p>
<p t="1088280" d="5200">processing the way that they’re acting—otherwise
they’re self-conscious and awkward. They’re</p>
<p t="1093480" d="5010">very fluid. It’s automatized behavior and
it’s coded right into them. So, if you’re</p>
<p t="1098490" d="3939">a great philosopher, according to Nietzsche
at least, what you do is you take a look at</p>
<p t="1102429" d="5130">how you act and what you think and then you
say “Well this is what it’s like.” It’s</p>
<p t="1107559" d="4901">not so much that you’re inventing new ideas;
it’s that you’re articulating the nature</p>
<p t="1112460" d="2180">of structures that are already there.</p>
<p t="1114640" d="5930">So, you can imagine, for example, imagine that
you’re particularly interested in wolves.</p>
<p t="1120570" d="3780">And so you go out and you study some wolves
and one of the things you see is that the</p>
<p t="1124350" d="5430">wolves have a dominance hierarchy. So, there’s
a leader and then there is struggle in the</p>
<p t="1129780" d="5149">pack to see who’s going to be the dominant
leader. Now, there’s a couple problems with</p>
<p t="1134929" d="5801">that which is that, you know if Wolf A and
Wolf B fight and they’re pretty evenly matched</p>
<p t="1140730" d="3800">and they tear each other to shreds, then Wolf
C is going to come in and pound both of them</p>
<p t="1144530" d="5670">and that’s not a particularly useful strategy
for Wolf A or for Wolf B. Plus then the pack</p>
<p t="1150200" d="5400">loses the power of Wolf A and Wolf B, so that’s
hardly useful at all. So, what’s happened</p>
<p t="1155600" d="4850">is that wolves have evolved dominance and
submission strategies so that they can figure</p>
<p t="1160450" d="4890">out who is going to lead and who is going
to follow without having to engage in the</p>
<p t="1165340" d="4050">kind of physical combat that’s going to
result in damage.</p>
<p t="1169390" d="4350">And so usually what happens is that two wolves
face off—you’ve probably seen cats do</p>
<p t="1173740" d="3660">this when they encounter each other you know
out on the street—the first thing they do</p>
<p t="1177400" d="4149">is sort of turn sideways and puff themselves
up, right, and they dance back and forth;</p>
<p t="1181549" d="3661">it’s quite comical. But what the cat’s
trying to do is look big and it’s supposed</p>
<p t="1185210" d="4849">to—it’s trying to make the other cat nervous
enough to leave. And so what wolves do is</p>
<p t="1190059" d="3411">roughly the same thing. They puff out so they
look big and they make all sorts of ferocious</p>
<p t="1193470" d="5860">noises and they threaten each other and usually
what happens is one wolf will lose his nerve,</p>
<p t="1199330" d="4800">flop down, roll over, and show his throat.
And that basically means something like “I’m</p>
<p t="1204130" d="4600">useless and, you know, and pathetic and you
can tear up my throat if you want because</p>
<p t="1208730" d="4220">of that,” and the other wolf thinks “Yeah,
you are pretty useless and pathetic, but you</p>
<p t="1212950" d="3339">know, we’re going to need you tomorrow to
hunt down a deer, so you know, you can get</p>
<p t="1216289" d="5331">up and protect your miserable self and that’ll
be okay.” Now, if you were watching that,</p>
<p t="1221620" d="4900">you might say, “Wolves follow rules,”
but of course they don’t; that’s just</p>
<p t="1226520" d="4850">how wolves act. When you describe what the
wolves are doing then you turn it into a rule,</p>
<p t="1231370" d="2870">but it wasn’t a rule to begin with; it was
just a pattern of behavior.</p>
<p t="1234240" d="6919">Now human beings are like that. We’re chalked
full of patterns of behavior. And they’re</p>
<p t="1241159" d="4531">the consequence of our biology, which is something
we’ll talk about in depth in the last half</p>
<p t="1245690" d="4200">and the course, and they’re a consequence
of our culture. And they’re built into our</p>
<p t="1249890" d="4470">bodies. Like every time you interact with
another person, they’re telling you how</p>
<p t="1254360" d="5870">to behave, right? “Don’t be too obtuse.”
“Try to be a little bit witty.” “Have</p>
<p t="1260230" d="3510">something interesting to say.” “Don’t
be too annoying.” “If you’re going to</p>
<p t="1263740" d="4880">say something funny make sure it’s funny.”
“Take turns while you talk.” “Play nicely.”</p>
<p t="1268620" d="6030">“Take your turn.” “Don’t eat all the
bread.” Etc, etc. You know, and so if you</p>
<p t="1274650" d="6490">don’t abide by those rules then people lift
their eyebrow at you. Or they don’t smile</p>
<p t="1281140" d="3269">at your jokes. Or they don’t look at you.
Or they roll their eyes when you come in,</p>
<p t="1284409" d="6341">which is really not a good sign by the way.
And you get punished severely for it. And</p>
<p t="1290750" d="3779">then if you do act like they would like you
to act, you know, then people smile at you</p>
<p t="1294529" d="3741">and they invite you to their place for dinner
and, you know, maybe you have an intimate</p>
<p t="1298270" d="4360">relationship and some people that like you.
And so we’re exchanging information about</p>
<p t="1302630" d="5940">how we should manifest ourselves in our bodies
with every possible interaction. And what</p>
<p t="1308570" d="2530">that means is that shapes the way that we
act.</p>
<p t="1311100" d="4970">Now, the problem is—or partly is—is that
you don’t really understand the consequences</p>
<p t="1316070" d="4349">of that. Like, you can act it out more or
less depending on your social skill and the</p>
<p t="1320419" d="4841">degree to which you’re been exposed to other
people, but that doesn’t mean that you’re</p>
<p t="1325260" d="4080">conscious—that you can consciously articulate
all the rules that underlie that and if you</p>
<p t="1329340" d="6300">think that maybe you can well fine. You know,
imagine a well-behaved four-year-old. You</p>
<p t="1335640" d="5539">know, by four, you’ve got a lot of the social
rules down because by four you can play with</p>
<p t="1341179" d="4541">others. If you’re ever going to be able
to you can already do it by the time you’re</p>
<p t="1345720" d="4589">four. If you can’t by the time you’re
four you are in serious trouble because other</p>
<p t="1350309" d="3421">kids won’t play with you and then they won’t
teach you how to act and then you stay immature</p>
<p t="1353730" d="6500">and isolated and, you know, off in you’re
little corner dejected and bitter for the</p>
<p t="1360230" d="3990">rest of your life. Now, you know, you might
that that’s a little rough but it’s not;</p>
<p t="1364220" d="2209">that’s what the data indicate.</p>
<p t="1366429" d="10370">So, anyways, what this means in part is, well,
we’ve been shaping how all of us behave</p>
<p t="1376799" d="7441">as long as we’ve been social. Now you might
say “Well how long have we been social?”</p>
<p t="1384240" d="8390">Well, crustaceans are social. So, lobsters,
for example, organize themselves into dominance</p>
<p t="1392630" d="5970">hierarchies and they modify each others’
behavior. And that’s 400 million years.</p>
<p t="1398600" d="9980">So, we’ve been social and living in groups
since our ancestors departed on the evolutionary</p>
<p t="1408580" d="4990">timescale from the ancestors of lobsters.
So, that’s a very very very long time. There</p>
<p t="1413570" d="7719">weren’t any trees around back then. So, social
life is older than trees. So, you can be sure</p>
<p t="1421289" d="5110">that you’re adapted to it in a major way.
So, it’s built into your biology but then</p>
<p t="1426399" d="6630">there’s the historic element of it too.
And it’s quite—we’re quite flexible</p>
<p t="1433029" d="1061">from a cultural perspective.</p>
<p t="1434090" d="5290">So, there’s an example: this guy named Robert
Sapolski, who I really like; he’s a great</p>
<p t="1439380" d="7200">scientist. He went off to Africa to study
baboons. And baboons are not pleasant, generally</p>
<p t="1446580" d="4260">speaking. They fight a lot; they’re bullies.
They bite. They can really bite. A baboon,</p>
<p t="1450840" d="5730">like a predatory cat will think twice about
taking on a baboon. They’ve got major teeth</p>
<p t="1456570" d="5290">and their temperament is not particularly
positive. Sapolski went and studied a group</p>
<p t="1461860" d="5990">of baboons and they were engaged in typical
baboon behavior, grasping each other all the</p>
<p t="1467850" d="3309">time and bullying each other. And they were
all stressed out because—Sapolski knew that</p>
<p t="1471159" d="4361">because he measured their levels of stress
and testosterone and so forth. And so it was</p>
<p t="1475520" d="5779">a pretty miserable baboon existence, but then
what happened was that the baboons went to</p>
<p t="1481299" d="5771">feed somewhere that I don’t remember and
they—a lot of them contracted tuberculosis.</p>
<p t="1487070" d="4770">And it turned out that almost all the hyper
aggressive males got tuberculosis and died</p>
<p t="1491840" d="4540">and all that was left was the beta males,
roughly speaking. And then the whole baboon</p>
<p t="1496380" d="4060">culture transformed so that it because much
more agreeable and much more cooperative.</p>
<p t="1500440" d="5550">And then when aggressive baboons would move
into that territory, you know singly, on their</p>
<p t="1505990" d="4850">own, then they’d get all placid and calm
too. So, it’s interesting because obviously</p>
<p t="1510840" d="5920">baboons aren’t social to the degree we are
but it does indicate that even at the advanced</p>
<p t="1516760" d="4690">primate level—you know their brains are
pretty big but not as big as ours—that cultural</p>
<p t="1521450" d="4959">transmission of behavior expectation can be
quite powerful and it can transform quite</p>
<p t="1526409" d="5301">rapidly. So, anyways we’ve been shaping
each others’ behavior for a very very very</p>
<p t="1531710" d="7170">very long time. And a lot of that’s encoding
deeply in biology and in culture.</p>
<p t="1538880" d="4769">Now biologically, and we’ll talk about this
a lot when we get to the biological section,</p>
<p t="1543649" d="5971">one of the ways you can know how social you
are is by how hurt and ashamed you get when</p>
<p t="1549620" d="4179">you make a serious social error. You know,
so if you’re at a party and you make a fool</p>
<p t="1553799" d="4031">of yourself, you know, depending on your level
of neuroticism—which is also a Big Five</p>
<p t="1557830" d="4680">Trait that indexes how sensitive you are to
negative emotion—you might obsess about</p>
<p t="1562510" d="3320">what an idiot you are for the next three or
four months, or maybe even for the next five</p>
<p t="1565830" d="6910">years. You know, people do not like social
exclusion. You know, and you have a little</p>
<p t="1572740" d="4580">counter that’s more or less built into the
back of your brain that roughly, first of</p>
<p t="1577320" d="3839">all it estimates how successful you are—there’s
an estimation that actually seems to occur</p>
<p t="1581159" d="5851">right at birth where when part of your neuroticism
levels are set. And then that can be modified</p>
<p t="1587010" d="5440">to some degree by learning. You know, and
if you’re a top baboon, well you’re going</p>
<p t="1592450" d="4349">to experience less negative emotion and more
satisfaction than you are if you’re a bottom</p>
<p t="1596799" d="6240">baboon and it’s exactly the same with people.
So, you know, we like to be climbing up dominance</p>
<p t="1603039" d="2821">hierarchies and we like to be near the top
of dominance hierarchies. And if the little</p>
<p t="1605860" d="3850">counter at the back of your brain notices
that, you know, you’re doing a good job</p>
<p t="1609710" d="4770">of climbing towards the top of relevant dominance
hierarchy then its going to produce more serotonin</p>
<p t="1614480" d="3829">and you’re not going to be in as much pain,
you’re not going to be as depressed, you’re</p>
<p t="1618309" d="5100">not going to be as anxious, you’re not going
to be stressed, and so forth. So there’s</p>
<p t="1623409" d="4740">a biological basis for our social being and
it’s extraordinarily important to us how</p>
<p t="1628149" d="1811">we fit into social groups.</p>
<p t="1629960" d="7510">Ok, so we’ve also been trying to figure
out what the hell we are, who we are, for</p>
<p t="1637470" d="5630">thousands and thousands of years, partly as
a consequence of imitation, you know, because</p>
<p t="1643100" d="4040">I can act you out and that’ll sort of help
me understand what you’re like; and partly</p>
<p t="1647140" d="5529">as a consequence of articulated communication.
A lot of that’s storytelling. Now people</p>
<p t="1652669" d="6240">have been telling stories for we have no idea
how long. I mean, if you go and visit peoples</p>
<p t="1658909" d="4740">that have no written language and who have
been isolated from the rest of human society</p>
<p t="1663649" d="4611">for let’s say tens of thousands of years—and
such people still exist—you find that they</p>
<p t="1668260" d="5659">tell stories, they dance, they act each other
out, you know. So, we know certainly that the</p>
<p t="1673919" d="4901">propensity to tell stories and to engage in
ritual behavior is far older than our ability</p>
<p t="1678820" d="5780">to write. I suspect you can push it back at
least 50 000 years, although I suspect it’s</p>
<p t="1684600" d="7880">a lot older than that. And so, what’s happened
is that across those timescales, we’ve started</p>
<p t="1692480" d="5460">to tell stories about one another that represent
how we act. And then you might think well</p>
<p t="1697940" d="3250">some of those stories are interesting and
memorable and some of them aren’t and then</p>
<p t="1701190" d="4640">we tend to remember the interesting and memorable
ones and pass them on.</p>
<p t="1705830" d="5810">And so you can also imagine human beings aggregating
together in groups of thousands and thousands</p>
<p t="1711640" d="4950">of people over thousands and thousands of
years telling their stories to one another</p>
<p t="1716590" d="4839">and hammering those stories into some sort
of mutually acceptable and comprehensible</p>
<p t="1721429" d="6421">form. And so, for example one example of that
is that if you look at the creation stories—the</p>
<p t="1727850" d="4449">creation story that say occurs in Genesis
in the Old Testament—it’s a member of</p>
<p t="1732299" d="6490">a class of creation stories that characterized
Middle Eastern mythology and it seems to have</p>
<p t="1738789" d="5201">arisen out of the organization of separate
Middle Eastern tribes thousands and thousands</p>
<p t="1743990" d="6330">of years ago, each with their own traditions,
into a relatively homogenous story that characterized</p>
<p t="1750320" d="9170">a large group of people’s central beliefs.
So, we have information about how we act from</p>
<p t="1759490" d="4500">the representations that we’ve made of those
actions that we’ve passed forward and a</p>
<p t="1763990" d="6200">lot of those take the form of myths—religious
stories. And, so, part of what we’re going</p>
<p t="1770190" d="7520">to do is we’re going to begin the course
with two foundation-establishing themes. One</p>
<p t="1777710" d="7469">has to do with the structure of mythological
representations and the second has to do with</p>
<p t="1785179" d="7051">a set of rituals and processes and beliefs
that have been identified more or less worldwide</p>
<p t="1792230" d="2640">that have to do with shamanic transformation.</p>
<p t="1794870" d="4909">Now, the title of this course is “Personality
and its Transformations,” and the reason</p>
<p t="1799779" d="5870">it’s titled that way is because you aren’t
just who you are. You’re also something</p>
<p t="1805649" d="4961">that changes all the time. You’re more like
a river than like a rock. You’re constantly</p>
<p t="1810610" d="6390">transforming. What’s the name of? The physicist
Erwin Schrödinger thought that people were</p>
<p t="1817000" d="5510">dissipative structures. It’s a very interesting
idea. So, a dissipative structure is a structure</p>
<p t="1822510" d="6240">that maintains its structural integrity while
its elements transform completely. So you</p>
<p t="1828750" d="2970">know when you let the water out of a sink
you get a whirlpool, right? And the whirlpool</p>
<p t="1831720" d="5459">is a fairly stable entity, but the water that
the whirlpool is made of is constantly changing.</p>
<p t="1837179" d="4161">That’s a dissipative structure. Well, that’s
what you’re like. You maintain your form</p>
<p t="1841340" d="5819">across time but your elements are constantly
transforming. And people are very very transformative</p>
<p t="1847159" d="6681">creatures. You know, we can, unlike animals
really because animals are sort of what they</p>
<p t="1853840" d="4100">are and that’s it. I mean they have some
capacity to learn but not much. Your typical</p>
<p t="1857940" d="5349">beaver is acting more or less today like,
you know, his great great great great grandfather</p>
<p t="1863289" d="7691">was acting 5000 years ago. There’s no real
accretion of culture, whereas with human being,</p>
<p t="1870980" d="5799">we transform like mad. I mean we do that culturally,
things aren’t much—there’s so many things,</p>
<p t="1876779" d="3250">for example, that are different now than there
were twenty years ago that it’s almost impossible</p>
<p t="1880029" d="640">to imagine.</p>
<p t="1880669" d="4720">And then, so we transform on a cultural scale
quite rapidly but we also do that individually.</p>
<p t="1885389" d="5400">I mean you guys have all just made the transition
to university, just roughly speaking. You</p>
<p t="1890789" d="4421">know, I’m sure that you’re like you were
in some ways when you were at high school,</p>
<p t="1895210" d="3750">but well hopefully you’re better than you
were in high school a whole bunch of ways</p>
<p t="1898960" d="5040">as well. You should be more mature but your
personality may have transformed substantially.</p>
<p t="1904000" d="5580">You know, and with any luck you’re not done
with your sequences of transformations. You</p>
<p t="1909580" d="3329">know, that’s going to be something that
characterizes you for the rest of your life</p>
<p t="1912909" d="5161">insofar as you’re a dynamic person, your
eyes are open, you pay attention, and you</p>
<p t="1918070" d="5160">can learn. And so one of the things you might
say is that the most stable thing there is</p>
<p t="1923230" d="4730">about you in personality is its capacity to
transform. And that’s really something that’s</p>
<p t="1927960" d="3980">worth knowing, you know, because one of the
things I can tell you about the great myths</p>
<p t="1931940" d="4020">of mankind—there’s lots of them and they
have different themes—but one of the most</p>
<p t="1935960" d="8020">powerful themes is the way you get yourself
out of trouble is to transform your personality.</p>
<p t="1943980" d="4409">Now you think, you kind of do that every time
you learn something, right, because you learn</p>
<p t="1948389" d="3221">something and you’re a little different
than you were before. Hopefully different</p>
<p t="1951610" d="4090">in a significant way and hopefully different
in a way that helps you solve problems that</p>
<p t="1955700" d="5640">you couldn’t solve before. So, you could
say that one of the leitmotifs of being human</p>
<p t="1961340" d="4179">is, “well if I encounter an obstacle I can
just transform and I can figure out some way</p>
<p t="1965519" d="4870">of getting around it,” and that’s something
that makes us quite remarkable. Now, and one</p>
<p t="1970389" d="6941">of the things that I could suggest to you,
and I think this is one of the largest ideas</p>
<p t="1977330" d="6010">that exist—especially communicable in this
short of time—is that it’s much better</p>
<p t="1983340" d="6980">to identify with your capacity to transform
than it is to identify with who you are now.</p>
<p t="1990320" d="3709">And that can get you out of an awful lot of
trouble. I mean one of the things that characterizes</p>
<p t="1994029" d="4380">ideologues, for example, or people who are
trapped in fixed belief systems is that they</p>
<p t="1998409" d="4260">worship who they are now. And that’d be
all fine if everything was going a hundred</p>
<p t="2002669" d="4390">percent for them but it’s seldom the case.
And so, unless you’re life is perfect—and</p>
<p t="2007059" d="6181">that seems highly improbable—maybe if you
were someone else it would be better. And</p>
<p t="2013240" d="4520">you know, that’s all you’ve got in some
sense because changing the world in some way</p>
<p t="2017760" d="3690">that’s going to make you feel better about
it, well you know, you might be able to do</p>
<p t="2021450" d="5209">that in some small way but the probability
that you could or should try to do that on</p>
<p t="2026659" d="3441">a large scale is—it’s pretty low.</p>
<p t="2030100" d="5750">So, in the mythological representation section
I’m going to talk to you about the fundamental</p>
<p t="2035850" d="6699">elements of narrative. And the reason that
I think that that’s necessary is because</p>
<p t="2042549" d="5220">there’s sort of two things that you have
to consider when you’re talking about people</p>
<p t="2047769" d="6581">and one is: objectively, what is a person
like? The same way you might think about what</p>
<p t="2054350" d="5750">a rat is like or maybe even what a rock is
like. So, that’s a scientific question in</p>
<p t="2060100" d="6090">some sense. But then there’s another question
which—or maybe two questions: how do people</p>
<p t="2066190" d="6020">act and how should they act? And maybe the
first one is a scientific question but the</p>
<p t="2072210" d="6010">second one certainly isn’t. And the way
that we explore how people do act and how</p>
<p t="2078220" d="4510">they should act has a lot more to do with
narrative than to do with science.</p>
<p t="2082730" d="3060">And you know, you know this; all you have
to do is think about it. You know, you think</p>
<p t="2085790" d="4350">about where do you get most of your information
about what people are like when you’re not</p>
<p t="2090140" d="4590">actually just interacting with some people.
And the answer to that is quite straightforward:</p>
<p t="2094730" d="5410">you read novels, you read literature, you
go see movies, you watch Game of Thrones,</p>
<p t="2100140" d="5050">you binge on Game of Thrones you know, you
go watch Star Wars, you know maybe you line</p>
<p t="2105190" d="4860">up for three days if you’re completely insane
to go see Star Wars. You know and you might</p>
<p t="2110050" d="5250">ask, “Well, what in the world are you doing?”
Well, people are hungry for information about</p>
<p t="2115300" d="8600">how people do act and how they should act.
And we’re absolutely compelled by narratives.</p>
<p t="2123900" d="3080">And there’s a reason for that. Well, and
you kind of know what a narrative is and what</p>
<p t="2126980" d="4310">one isn’t, right? You go to a movie and
you think, “Ah, the character development’s</p>
<p t="2131290" d="4870">pretty good but, you know, as a story it was
terrible.” And then maybe you talk to your</p>
<p t="2136160" d="3820">friends about why it was a terrible story
but the funny thing is you kind of know, right?</p>
<p t="2139980" d="5540">It’s like, some things are stories and some
things aren’t and laying out what actually</p>
<p t="2145520" d="7020">makes something a story, that’s very difficult.
But you still know it and you can have some consensus</p>
<p t="2152540" d="6530">even. You know, if you look on IMDB or Rotten
Tomatoes, you know, people form large-group</p>
<p t="2159070" d="5500">consensus about what constitutes an acceptable
narrative pretty damn quickly. And there seems</p>
<p t="2164570" d="5840">to be at least a certain amount of agreement,
you know, barring individual differences.</p>
<p t="2170410" d="9170">So, the mythological and the shamanic discussions
that we’re going to undertake have a couple</p>
<p t="2179580" d="6780">of purposes and one is to provide you with
the foundations of a language that you can</p>
<p t="2186360" d="5730">use to understand narrative. And that’s
going to prove very very useful because most</p>
<p t="2192090" d="5540">of the clinical theories that we’re going
to talk about are really narrative based.</p>
<p t="2197630" d="5080">And once you understand their mythological
substructure so to speak, it gives you a framework</p>
<p t="2202710" d="4790">within which you can slot the theories. You
know, because one of the things that’s complicated</p>
<p t="2207500" d="4630">about personality theory is that there are
a lot of personality theories. And you might</p>
<p t="2212130" d="5800">think, “Well, how the hell can that be?”
Because if it’s a theory, theoretically</p>
<p t="2217930" d="2970">there can only be one. Like, there’s only
one Theory of Relativity, roughly speaking,</p>
<p t="2220900" d="4840">because it’s a little fuzzy around the edges
but people agree on the core elements. While</p>
<p t="2225740" d="7010">with personality theory, there’s many many
different personality theories. And, so, then</p>
<p t="2232750" d="3280">you might think, “Well, how are you supposed
to make any sense out of that?” And well</p>
<p t="2236030" d="5810">there’s two ways. One is to put of all of
them into a more fundamental underlying structure,</p>
<p t="2241840" d="3180">and that’s something that I’m really going
to strive to have you guys do while you’re</p>
<p t="2245020" d="5080">taking this course. And the other is to actually
adopt a slightly different set of presuppositions</p>
<p t="2250100" d="1520">about personality theories.</p>
<p t="2251620" d="5080">And so you can say, “Well, there’s only
one Theory of Relativity,” but then you</p>
<p t="2256700" d="5910">might say, “Well yeah, there’s only one
Theory of Relativity but then consider a toolbox.”</p>
<p t="2262610" d="5740">So maybe some of you are relatively handy
and you have a toolbox. What’s in a toolbox?</p>
<p t="2268350" d="8510">Hammers—or a hammer—saws, wrenches, pliers,
vise grips, etc. You know and you might say,</p>
<p t="2276860" d="7880">“Well, they’re tools. Why do you need
all those tools?” And the answer is well,</p>
<p t="2284740" d="3670">you can hammer a nail in with a wrench but
it’d be a lot better if you could use a</p>
<p t="2288410" d="3480">hammer and you can probably bang a bolt off
with a hammer but it would be a lot better</p>
<p t="2291890" d="4250">if you have a wrench. And, so, then you might
think, “Well, if you’re trying to do something</p>
<p t="2296140" d="6510">complicated and sophisticated, why not have
a bunch of tools?” Now, we don’t generally</p>
<p t="2302650" d="6710">think of scientific theories as tools, although
that is what they are. Above all else, they’re</p>
<p t="2309360" d="690">tools.</p>
<p t="2310050" d="3420">And then when we’re dealing with something
as complicated as a human being, well we may</p>
<p t="2313470" d="4170">need more than one tool to get to the bottom
of it. And it’s also the case, you know,</p>
<p t="2317640" d="5480">that to say understand a human being, well
that’s a complicated thing. It’s like—because</p>
<p t="2323120" d="5450">you might say, “Understand to what end?”
You don’t mean comprehensive, universal,</p>
<p t="2328570" d="4170">omniscient understanding. Obviously, you mean,
“I want to know X about someone because</p>
<p t="2332740" d="5930">I have some desire in relationship to my interactions
with them.” And so, there’s all sorts</p>
<p t="2338670" d="6340">of tools that can facilitate that. So what
I would say is that, you know, Freud’s a</p>
<p t="2345010" d="5110">microscope and Jung is a telescope; that’s
one way of thinking about it. I mean there’s</p>
<p t="2350120" d="4320">no particular reason I associated either of
those with those two tools, but the point</p>
<p t="2354440" d="6440">is is that if paid careful attention to personality
theories they can expand your capacity to</p>
<p t="2360880" d="5650">represent yourself in ways that’s extremely
useful. Because, you know, you should understand</p>
<p t="2366530" d="6650">who you are and why, and what implications
that has for you. Because you’re a transformable</p>
<p t="2373180" d="3940">creature but you also have a fairly stable
underlying substructure, right? Otherwise</p>
<p t="2377120" d="6490">you’d just melt like an octopus. So, you’re
this weird dynamic combination of relatively</p>
<p t="2383610" d="7160">permanent structure and then embedded capacity
to transform. You have a nature and so understanding</p>
<p t="2390770" d="4280">your nature is extraordinarily worthwhile.
And so hopefully what we’re going to do</p>
<p t="2395050" d="4490">during this course is give you a whole bunch
of tools to understand yourself and other</p>
<p t="2399540" d="5590">people with. Tools that will really be useful;
things you can use day to day to understand</p>
<p t="2405130" d="5190">yourselves and your families and so on and
to improve your future—with any luck. And</p>
<p t="2410320" d="7060">then also cover the elements of you that are
stable, most of which I would say have been</p>
<p t="2417380" d="5990">discovered—at least in the more objective
sense—by biological psychologists. So, mostly</p>
<p t="2423370" d="2220">animal researchers peculiarly enough.</p>
<p t="2425590" d="4930">Okay, so mythological representations—we’re
going to take a trip back through time. We’re</p>
<p t="2430520" d="7300">going to look at archaic and ancient stories
of mankind told by members of our species</p>
<p t="2437820" d="5650">to each other. And I’m going to concentrate
on stories that have lasted—we don’t know</p>
<p t="2443470" d="6070">how long. You know, we have stories that in
the written form are 4000 years old, but all</p>
<p t="2449540" d="5850">the evidence suggests that those stories are
based on traditions that go back far far beyond</p>
<p t="2455390" d="6980">that; at least 50 000 years—and maybe way
before that. So we’ll take a look at those</p>
<p t="2462370" d="3960">and that will give us a foundation that we
can use to build on. And then we’re going</p>
<p t="2466330" d="7410">to look at shamanic rituals and descriptions
to get some sense of the archetype of transformation,</p>
<p t="2473740" d="5120">which sort of means, well, what is it that
you have to undergo when you’re changing</p>
<p t="2478860" d="3710">and what are you likely to experience when
that happens? Now I can give you a bit of</p>
<p t="2482570" d="8270">a preview: um, it’s not always the case—maybe
it’s seldom the case—that if you learn</p>
<p t="2490840" d="6240">something important that it’s pleasant.
You know, this happens to people all the time.</p>
<p t="2497080" d="5050">So maybe, I don’t know, maybe you had a
recent relationship that went seriously sour.</p>
<p t="2502130" d="3080">And you know maybe it was because you were
going out with a jerk or maybe it’s because</p>
<p t="2505210" d="4050">you’re just not very sophisticated. And
no doubt you’re trying to figure out which</p>
<p t="2509260" d="4870">of those happens to be true while you’re,
you know, considering the relationship. But</p>
<p t="2514130" d="4700">generally what happens to people when they’re
moving towards something and the bottom falls</p>
<p t="2518830" d="5610">out, because something occurs that they didn’t
understand and couldn’t predict, maybe in</p>
<p t="2524440" d="4110">their own behavior—maybe you had an affair
while you were in your relationship and you</p>
<p t="2528550" d="5940">didn’t expect that—well, what happens
is your current model of yourself, and perhaps</p>
<p t="2534490" d="7700">even of the world, is demonstrated as insufficient.
And that rattles you up badly. And then you’re</p>
<p t="2542190" d="4660">rattled up for some good length of time—not
very motivated, somewhat depressed, fairly</p>
<p t="2546850" d="4790">anxious, you sort of fell apart, you don’t
know which way is up. And then maybe if you’re</p>
<p t="2551640" d="4120">lucky you think about it and talk about it
and put yourself back together. And when you</p>
<p t="2555760" d="3520">come out the other side you’re a little
smarter and a little more together than you</p>
<p t="2559280" d="1020">were to begin with.</p>
<p t="2560300" d="5190">Now, if you’re unlucky, you just stay in
the little pit for—people can stay in the</p>
<p t="2565490" d="4940">little pit for a very very long time and that’s
not so good. And so, you know, the process</p>
<p t="2570430" d="4330">of transforming is actually quite dangerous
because it doesn’t necessarily have to be</p>
<p t="2574760" d="6230">completed in a successful manner. But it does
have a pattern and the pattern usually is</p>
<p t="2580990" d="4800">you think you know what you’re doing and
then something happens to demonstrate that</p>
<p t="2585790" d="5350">you actually don’t know what you’re doing.
And that puts you in a spin. And then through</p>
<p t="2591140" d="5460">careful analysis and support and discussion—and
other processes that we don’t really understand</p>
<p t="2596600" d="7430">very well—you come to incorporate the anomalous
knowledge that knocked you on your back, you</p>
<p t="2604030" d="8340">reconstruct your personality and your representations
of the world, and then you move ahead, hopefully,</p>
<p t="2612370" d="4860">more than you were before. But it’s an interesting
thing to know, you know. One of the things</p>
<p t="2617230" d="4080">Nietzsche said, again was that you could—you
could tell the character of a human being</p>
<p t="2621310" d="5510">by how much truth they’re willing to tolerate.
Now that’s an interesting phrase, eh, because</p>
<p t="2626820" d="3550">you generally think of people, because they’re
optimistic, they generally think of truth</p>
<p t="2630370" d="4450">as something positive; obviously it’s better
to know the truth. It’s like, no, if you</p>
<p t="2634820" d="4360">pull the wool over your eyes as a general
rule learning the truth is not a pleasant</p>
<p t="2639180" d="3450">experience. That doesn’t necessarily mean
that it’s something—not something you</p>
<p t="2642630" d="9420">should do, but the idea that the path to enlightenment
is blissful: that’s not a very smart idea.</p>
<p t="2652050" d="2770">In fact, it’s quite the opposite.</p>
<p t="2654820" d="5910">So, the shamanic rituals basically manifest
in an archetypal way. So, one of the things</p>
<p t="2660730" d="5530">you see happening with the typical—the shaman,
by the way shamanism is a worldwide phenomena</p>
<p t="2666260" d="6730">and it seems to be associated with primordial
or archaic psychology of transformation. It’s</p>
<p t="2672990" d="7350">often drug-aided. And generally what happens
is that the shamanic transformation is accompanied</p>
<p t="2680340" d="6410">by the descent into something approximating
psychological death and then a rebuilding</p>
<p t="2686750" d="4270">and a rebirth that puts the person out on
the other side. It’s like an initiation</p>
<p t="2691020" d="4100">ritual and that’s another way of thinking
about it. Or you might think about it as the</p>
<p t="2695120" d="7270">depressing that possessed you during your
first semester of university which either</p>
<p t="2702390" d="3750">knocked you out of the university altogether—because
that happens to a lot of people—or which</p>
<p t="2706140" d="4960">you recovered from and finally became a university
student, although perhaps that wasn’t a</p>
<p t="2711100" d="4230">particularly pleasant transition. You know,
we’ve done some testing with U of T students</p>
<p t="2715330" d="4170">and it’s interesting to note that about
a third of you meet criteria for clinical</p>
<p t="2719500" d="4620">depression your first year here. Now what
that indicates to me is that the criteria</p>
<p t="2724120" d="5120">for clinical depression are a little on the
sensitive side, but regardless—because if</p>
<p t="2729240" d="4290">a third of people meet the criteria you think,
“Yeah, well that’s a little sensitive.”</p>
<p t="2733530" d="6820">But by the same token, you know, it’s not
an easy adjustment and the old you has die.</p>
<p t="2740350" d="5030">And generally that’s not very pleasant.
So, and it’s a good way to think about the</p>
<p t="2745380" d="3880">impediments to learning because you hardly
ever learn something without having part of</p>
<p t="2749260" d="4720">you die first. And that’s part of the reason
that people are rather resistant to learning</p>
<p t="2753980" d="1090">anything new that’s important.</p>
<p t="2755070" d="5640">Okay, well so you’ve got that. Now, after
that we’re going to talk about Piaget. And</p>
<p t="2760710" d="8770">Piaget isn’t necessarily known as a personality
psychologist but that’s okay. Piaget published</p>
<p t="2769480" d="5360">a very—he was a developmental psychologist,
maybe the greatest developmental psychologist.</p>
<p t="2774840" d="5680">He published a very large number of books—many
of which haven’t even been translated yet,</p>
<p t="2780520" d="4070">some of which haven’t even been published
yet. So, Piaget thought a lot of things about</p>
<p t="2784590" d="4430">a lot of things. And he’s generally known
for his stage theory of developmental but</p>
<p t="2789020" d="3810">he really wasn’t all that into that stage
theory. It just seemed to be the part of his</p>
<p t="2792830" d="6400">theory that I would say rather dimwitted Western
intellectuals could grasp onto most easily</p>
<p t="2799230" d="5460">and so that’s generally what you hear about.
But Piaget was a very very sophisticated thinker.</p>
<p t="2804690" d="5680">And one of the things he was interested in
was, well he was interested in how the child</p>
<p t="2810370" d="4010">in some sense boots itself up. That’s a
reasonable way of thinking about it, because</p>
<p t="2814380" d="5710">you know when you turn on a computer, what
happens is a certain number of primitive functions—primitive</p>
<p t="2820090" d="4730">fundamental functions—come online first.
And then those functions enable more complex</p>
<p t="2824820" d="5440">functions to emerge. And then those functions
enable more complex functions to emerge. And</p>
<p t="2830260" d="6560">soon there your computer is, waiting for you.
And human beings are kind of like that. So</p>
<p t="2836820" d="5840">when we’re first born—we’re very primitive
when we’re first born. We’re very immature;</p>
<p t="2842660" d="3090">that’s a better way of thinking about it.
We’re not precisely primitive; we still</p>
<p t="2845750" d="3920">have very large brains and there are more
connections in those brains at birth than</p>
<p t="2849670" d="5300">there will be for the rest of your life, which
is quite interesting. You actually die into</p>
<p t="2854970" d="4530">your personality. Because what happens isn’t
so much that you make new connections; it’s</p>
<p t="2859500" d="5020">that a whole bunch of the ones you already
have that you don’t use disappear. So that’s</p>
<p t="2864520" d="1460">pretty peculiar.</p>
<p t="2865980" d="5310">Anyways, when you’re first born there’s
not a lot to you in terms of capacity to engage</p>
<p t="2871290" d="4120">with the world. Your moth is pretty wired
up, your lips and your tongue—which is a</p>
<p t="2875410" d="4210">good thing because you have to breastfeed
and that’s actually not very simple. You</p>
<p t="2879620" d="4210">have to have a clue to do that and it’s
the first complex social interaction that</p>
<p t="2883830" d="6180">you’re likely to engage in. So, you—you’re
born with a bit of a priori sophisticated</p>
<p t="2890010" d="5910">wiring already in place, but the rest of you,
man, it’s not there much at all. You can’t</p>
<p t="2895920" d="4200">control your arms; you know if you watch a
baby in a crib—a young baby—and it’s</p>
<p t="2900120" d="4030">not swaddled up, you know their arms sort
of float around in space and so do their legs.</p>
<p t="2904150" d="3310">And now and then they might hit themselves
and generally that seems to come as quite</p>
<p t="2907460" d="7010">a shock to the baby. It’s not—its peripheral
nervous system, the peripheral elements of</p>
<p t="2914470" d="5600">its central nervous system are not well developed
at birth. And so it’s almost as if the baby</p>
<p t="2920070" d="5550">has to discover its limbs—it sort of expands
from the middle outwards—it has to discover</p>
<p t="2925620" d="4450">its limbs and then start to figure out what
to do with them.</p>
<p t="2930070" d="6980">And so what Piaget attempted to do was to
lay out the processes by which a child unfolded</p>
<p t="2937050" d="5880">into the world. Now, some of—there’s a
biological basis to that because you come</p>
<p t="2942930" d="5940">into the world at birth with a set of reflexes
at hand. And those reflexes are enough to</p>
<p t="2948870" d="7140">get you started. And so Piaget—here’s
one way of trying to understand Piaget. I</p>
<p t="2956010" d="4930">like it quite a bit. It’s a bit of an oversimplification
but it’ll do. There’s lots of different</p>
<p t="2960940" d="4480">ways of thinking about what the world is made
of. Now, you know, if you’re classically—if</p>
<p t="2965420" d="4090">you’re a classical scientist—you tend
to think that the world’s made out of matter.</p>
<p t="2969510" d="4700">You know and then matter is made out of atoms
and then atoms are made of—god only knows</p>
<p t="2974210" d="4120">what atoms are made out of, right, because
by the time you get under atoms you just have</p>
<p t="2978330" d="3950">no idea what’s going on down there. But,
you know, we generally don’t think about</p>
<p t="2982280" d="4870">that too much and we sort of assume Newtonian
reality and that everything is made out of</p>
<p t="2987150" d="3900">hard little particles like dust and that’s
the scientific model.</p>
<p t="2991050" d="5780">But there’s other ways of looking at the
world that are not only equally valid but</p>
<p t="2996830" d="4720">equally necessary and equally powerful. One
of them is that you can look at the world</p>
<p t="3001550" d="5960">as a matrix of information. You know, and
so information generally has significance</p>
<p t="3007510" d="5160">and meaning—at least insofar as information
is conceptualized by human beings. And so,</p>
<p t="3012670" d="3980">for example, if you’re ten years old and
you’re crawling around on the floor and</p>
<p t="3016650" d="7080">the dog has a ball and you grab it and the
dog nips you, that’s informative. And so,</p>
<p t="3023730" d="7450">what Piaget claims is that children come into
the world with an information-seeking structure</p>
<p t="3031180" d="7260">and that as they interact with the world phenomena
emerge that they can model with their bodies.</p>
<p t="3038440" d="7630">So, for example, if I’m going to drink this
then I have to model it with my hand before</p>
<p t="3046070" d="4660">I can do so. And so it turns out, for example,
when if this thing’s sitting here—especially</p>
<p t="3050730" d="6580">if I’m thirsty—and I look at it my eyes
tell my hands to get ready to grab it. And</p>
<p t="3057310" d="6810">so when you say you understand something what
you mean is that—part of what you mean—is</p>
<p t="3064120" d="6500">that when you perceive it, it maps itself
onto your body. And so this happens at pretty</p>
<p t="3070620" d="1420">low levels of your nervous system.</p>
<p t="3072040" d="5710">So, for example, there are people who are
blind. They say they’re blind; they can’t</p>
<p t="3077750" d="5770">see anything. But if you move your hands up
like this and ask them to guess which hand</p>
<p t="3083520" d="4440">you’re lifting they can do it with almost
a hundred percent accuracy. And you think,</p>
<p t="3087960" d="4870">“Well how the hell can that possibly be?
They’re blind!” Well, the reason that</p>
<p t="3092830" d="5690">happens is because your eyes are detecting
patterns in the world, some of those patterns</p>
<p t="3098520" d="7260">you perceive as conscious reality, but other
patterns are just mapped onto your spine or</p>
<p t="3105780" d="3910">onto your emotional system. Doesn’t—you
don’t need the perception of the object</p>
<p t="3109690" d="3160">in order to have that activated. Because,
you know, you probably think, “There’s</p>
<p t="3112850" d="3630">the world,” you see it, you think about
it, you evaluate it, and you act. It’s like,</p>
<p t="3116480" d="5520">that isn’t how it works. It’s very seldomly
how it works. Partly because it’s just too</p>
<p t="3122000" d="4410">damn slow. You know, if you had to think about
everything you’d be running over pedestrians</p>
<p t="3126410" d="4080">nonstop, right? You have to be able to react
very very quickly and part of the way you</p>
<p t="3130490" d="7470">do that is by having your sensory systems
map right onto your motor output systems.</p>
<p t="3137960" d="12490">So, Piaget. Well, for Piaget, part of the way
that the personality emerges out of the doldrums</p>
<p t="3150450" d="6170">of infancy is that the child encounters the
world and incorporates the information that</p>
<p t="3156620" d="4690">they gather as a consequence of bumping up
against it. And, then, they build themselves</p>
<p t="3161310" d="5220">in some sense from their bodies and the ability—the
abilities that they’re practicing with their</p>
<p t="3166530" d="3980">bodies like the gripping mechanism and the
pointing mechanism and the scratching mechanism</p>
<p t="3170510" d="4190">and all those things that they can build—they
build those up to the point where the can</p>
<p t="3174700" d="5510">start to use abstractions. And so the baby
sort of spirals out of nowhere using its exploratory</p>
<p t="3180210" d="4870">capacity, absorbing information from the world,
and creates its personality that way. It’s</p>
<p t="3185080" d="3830">a lovely model and we’ll cover that in some
detail.</p>
<p t="3188910" d="6390">The depth psychologists. I concentrate primarily
on Jung and Freud. And you know if you take</p>
<p t="3195300" d="5280">a personality course, generally you’ll be
introduced to Freud first and then you’ll</p>
<p t="3200580" d="3840">be introduced to Jung and maybe Adler and
some of the neo-Freudians, more or less as</p>
<p t="3204420" d="8360">afterthoughts to Freud. But I don’t really
think that’s appropriate. First of all,</p>
<p t="3212780" d="8670">I think you can make a strong case that Jung
was—that the utility of Jung’s theory</p>
<p t="3221450" d="7010">is particularly evident when you’re talking
about radical similarities between people.</p>
<p t="3228460" d="7450">So, Jung was very biologically orientated.
In some ways he was way ahead of biological</p>
<p t="3235910" d="6270">psychiatrists and psychologists because when
Jung was beginning to formulate his theories,</p>
<p t="3242180" d="5390">in the West—in North America anyways and
in the United States—most of the people</p>
<p t="3247570" d="4150">who were studying human beings were behaviorists.
And behaviorists basically presume that you</p>
<p t="3251720" d="5120">were a blank slate at birth and that you learned
how to do everything that you know how to</p>
<p t="3256840" d="6140">do. Well, that’s not true at all.</p>
<p t="3262980" d="4110">First of all, you can’t learn everything
that you know how to do because you have to</p>
<p t="3267090" d="5310">know something to start the whole process
off, and second, you know, you don’t have</p>
<p t="3272400" d="4210">to learn really to understand what a dog’s
growl means. You know it’s kind of wired</p>
<p t="3276610" d="4130">into you. And you really don’t have to learn
to be afraid of the dark, man. You’ve got</p>
<p t="3280740" d="3780">that down by the time you’re about three.
You know, so there’s lots of things that</p>
<p t="3284520" d="3820">are built right into people and what exactly
that means we’re not sure about. I mean</p>
<p t="3288340" d="6010">it does look, for example, like snake phobia
is innate and even if the actual phobia</p>
<p t="3294350" d="3910">isn’t innate—and it probably is—you
can learn to be phobic of snakes in no time</p>
<p t="3298260" d="4640">flat, whereas like trying to become phobic
of pistols is very very difficult.</p>
<p t="3302900" d="5020">Now, Jung was very interested in the—I think
what the best way to think about it is the</p>
<p t="3307920" d="5410">substrata of human cognition. You know, because
human beings are a particular type of thing.</p>
<p t="3313330" d="6630">It’s not like our souls are disconnected
from our bodies and that our knowledge is</p>
<p t="3319960" d="8010">somehow appropriate or universal in some way
that would make sense if we didn’t have</p>
<p t="3327970" d="6330">bodies. We’re not like that at all. We’re
in our bodies. Our brains are adapted to our</p>
<p t="3334300" d="5490">bodies. Our minds are adapted to our bodies
and so is our knowledge. And that means that</p>
<p t="3339790" d="6060">our cognitive abilities—our theories of
the world—have biological substructures</p>
<p t="3345850" d="4600">and those are presuppositions in some sense
for our knowledge that we don’t have to</p>
<p t="3350450" d="4560">learn. So, for example, you don’t really
have to learn that being punched hurts; you</p>
<p t="3355010" d="4330">just discover that. You don’t really have
to learn what a smile means. You don’t really</p>
<p t="3359340" d="4740">have to learn what anger means. You know,
you’ll experience it. So it’s right in</p>
<p t="3364080" d="4780">you. You watch little kids, little babies—when
they’re crying they’re often angry. So,</p>
<p t="3368860" d="8140">for example, by nine months of age a baby
can more or less identify its mother. So, someone</p>
<p t="3377000" d="4050">walks into the baby’s room and takes a look
at the baby and it’s not the baby’s mother</p>
<p t="3381050" d="3660">and the baby starts crying and you think,
“Oh, poor baby.” It’s like, fair enough,</p>
<p t="3384710" d="5530">that baby is not sad; that baby is angry.
And you can tell if you look at the baby because</p>
<p t="3390240" d="4280">it’s turning all red and that’s what people
do when they cry when they’re angry. And</p>
<p t="3394520" d="3280">so it’s a good thing to know when you’re
arguing with someone and they get upset and</p>
<p t="3397800" d="4690">maybe they start to cry. You think, “Oh,
the poor person,” but then if you look you’ll</p>
<p t="3402490" d="3700">see that they’re all red. And that means
that they’d like to strangle you but their,</p>
<p t="3406190" d="4480">you know, their social niceties is hopefully
preventing them. So, and that can certainly</p>
<p t="3410670" d="4660">change your attitude towards whether or not
you should be feeling sorry for them when</p>
<p t="3415330" d="960">they hurt their feelings.</p>
<p t="3416290" d="4630">So, there’s all sorts of things that are
universal about human beings and Jung was</p>
<p t="3420920" d="4630">very very interested in what those universals
are and how they played out in patterns of</p>
<p t="3425550" d="7980">behavior. So, you can imagine—you can imagine
that you have an instinct, say like anger.</p>
<p t="3433530" d="2950">And thinking about it that way, it’s like
a cross-section: that’s person’s angry.</p>
<p t="3436480" d="4550">You know, and you can imagine the facial configuration
that would go along with that. But in a more</p>
<p t="3441030" d="4860">sophisticated way if you wanted to represent
anger maybe you’d represent it like a drama—like</p>
<p t="3445890" d="6960">a story. You know, and that’s actually what
you want to know if someone gets angry, right?</p>
<p t="3452850" d="5580">“What happened?” Well, imagine if you
took a thousand stories about angry people</p>
<p t="3458430" d="4930">and you boiled them all into one story so
that everything that was common about all</p>
<p t="3463360" d="4650">the stories about anger were encapsulated
in a single story. Well, that would be the</p>
<p t="3468010" d="5400">archetypal story of anger. And everyone would
recognize it because it’s like anger represented</p>
<p t="3473410" d="4580">like a movie in some sense in it’s purest
form. Well that’s an archetype and that’s</p>
<p t="3477990" d="3750">the sort of thing that Jung was extraordinarily
interested in—understanding and documenting.</p>
<p t="3481740" d="4060">And it’s a tremendous amount of fun. So
one of the things we’ll do is I’m going</p>
<p t="3485800" d="3950">to show you some movies—probably the Lion
King, at least parts of it—and I’m going</p>
<p t="3489750" d="4770">to show you how the archetypal structure manifests
itself. And that’s really worth knowing.</p>
<p t="3494520" d="4140">It’s kind of a pain because then from now
on you’ll go to movies and you’ll think,</p>
<p t="3498660" d="2840">“Oh well, that’s that archetypal structure,”
and “That’s what that symbol means,”</p>
<p t="3501500" d="5620">and you’ll really be annoying to your friends.
But it’s very entertaining and it’s very</p>
<p t="3507120" d="4200">illuminating. And partly because what’s
really cool about these archetypal story structures</p>
<p t="3511320" d="4830">is not only do they tell you who they are
but they tell you in some sense who you should</p>
<p t="3516150" d="1010">be.</p>
<p t="3517160" d="3560">Now, that’s cool, because one of the things
that modern people have a real problem with</p>
<p t="3520720" d="4910">is trying to understand whether or not life
has any meaning, you know. We look at the</p>
<p t="3525630" d="4030">world from a scientific perspective and we
say, “Well, it appears that all this is,</p>
<p t="3529660" d="4030">you know, without meaning; it doesn’t mean
anything with any cosmic sense.” It’s</p>
<p t="3533690" d="6270">a pretty dopey conclusion as far as I’m
concerned because the originators of the scientific</p>
<p t="3539960" d="6610">method excluded subjective meaning from the
doctrine at the outset. So, you know, if you</p>
<p t="3546570" d="3380">look at the world scientifically and you say,
“Well, it’s without subjective meaning,”</p>
<p t="3549950" d="4720">it’s like, “Well, yeah, obviously,” because
science was set up so that all the subjective</p>
<p t="3554670" d="4120">meaning would be stripped away from the phenomena.
So, you know, it’s not something to be really</p>
<p t="3558790" d="4230">shocked about afterwards and it also doesn’t
mean that there’s no such thing as subjective</p>
<p t="3563020" d="4270">meaning. It just means that it’s very difficult
to get a grip on from a purely scientific</p>
<p t="3567290" d="960">perspective.</p>
<p t="3568250" d="6260">And one of the lovely things about archetypal
stories is they tell you in a way that’s</p>
<p t="3574510" d="7240">universally believable who you are. And that’s
very cool. And, you know, because you think—you</p>
<p t="3581750" d="6300">learn this in university too and it just tears
me up, you know. You learn implicitly or explicitly</p>
<p t="3588050" d="3400">in almost all of the fields of study that
you’re going to undertake—especially on</p>
<p t="3591450" d="5580">the humanities end—that morality is relative
and that there’s no ultimate meaning, which</p>
<p t="3597030" d="5360">is a really rotten thing to be teaching people
of your age. You know, because you’re too</p>
<p t="3602390" d="4530">damn young to be nihilistic. You know, you
can be nihilistic when you’re 85—you’re</p>
<p t="3606920" d="4670">all done by then—but to be nihilistic now
that’s a bloody catastrophe. You know, and</p>
<p t="3611590" d="5320">it’s completely pointless because the notion
of—the notion that things are meaningless</p>
<p t="3616910" d="8220">in some ultimate sense: it’s an extraordinarily
primitive philosophical theory. And it does</p>
<p t="3625130" d="6270">not serve people well. It makes them sick.
And so one of the things that you might consider</p>
<p t="3631400" d="4540">is that if your stupid theory makes you sick
maybe there’s something wrong with it. It</p>
<p t="3635940" d="7150">might be a criteria for the utility—or perhaps
even the truth of the theory, you know. Depends</p>
<p t="3643090" d="5040">on how you think about these things. You know,
you might say, “Well, if a truth makes you</p>
<p t="3648130" d="4440">sick that doesn’t mean it’s any less of
a truth.” Well, maybe. Maybe it really does</p>
<p t="3652570" d="4670">mean that it’s much much less of a truth.
It depends to some degree what you mean by</p>
<p t="3657240" d="1610">truth.</p>
<p t="3658850" d="5930">So, anyways, Jung’s very very very very useful
for that. He’s a terrifying thinker. Really,</p>
<p t="3664780" d="6750">like I read—when I was about 23 or 24 I
spent two years and I read pretty much about</p>
<p t="3671530" d="5130">everything Jung wrote; it’s about twenty-three
volumes. And it just blew me into bits. I</p>
<p t="3676660" d="5700">had no idea what the hell was going on—my
dreams changed. Really, it was really rough.</p>
<p t="3682360" d="4580">I was reading Nietzsche at the same time and
he’s just about as bad. Like Nietzsche said</p>
<p t="3686940" d="3610">he philosophized with a hammer. You know,
and that’s great unless he’s taking a</p>
<p t="3690550" d="5360">hammer to your skull and that’s not nearly
so pleasant. So, you know, Jung—he’s a</p>
<p t="3695910" d="2670">completely different sort of creature and
I think that’s part of the reason that you</p>
<p t="3698580" d="4020">never really learn about him in university.
You know, if you don’t understand him he</p>
<p t="3702600" d="3440">looks weird, and if you do understand him
a little bit he’s terrifying and you’re</p>
<p t="3706040" d="3800">bloody well going to stop. You’ll think,
“Ah, no that’s okay. I don’t—I don’t</p>
<p t="3709840" d="1590">really need to know that.”</p>
<p t="3711430" d="9290">So, Freud. Freud’s a nice whipping boy for
psychologists, which I also think is pretty</p>
<p t="3720720" d="4300">pathetic because ungrateful to begin with.
You know, Freud was really the person who</p>
<p t="3725020" d="4410">formalized the idea of the unconscious. You
know, and everyone takes that for granted,</p>
<p t="3729430" d="4740">that there’s a cognitive unconscious. That’s
what the psychologists discovered in what,</p>
<p t="3734170" d="3670">the 1980’s. “There’s a cognitive unconscious.”
It’s like, “Yeah, good work guys. They’d</p>
<p t="3737840" d="5310">figured that out back in 1910.” You know,
but you don’t see credit being given to</p>
<p t="3743150" d="3800">Freud for making that sort of discovery if
you look at experimental psychology, which</p>
<p t="3746950" d="2500">I think—like I said—I think that’s really
ungrateful.</p>
<p t="3749450" d="6860">Freud’s a strange guy. And, you know, you
can take issue with—especially the details</p>
<p t="3756310" d="4120">of his theory. You know, like the Oedipal
complex, for example, or penis envy, those</p>
<p t="3760430" d="6570">sorts of things. It’s like, you know, in
some ways they seem laughably anachronistic,</p>
<p t="3767000" d="7560">but you know sometimes someone can be wrong
in the details and right in the overall conception.</p>
<p t="3774560" d="3830">You know, because theories are multilayered
things, right? So, sometimes I read a student</p>
<p t="3778390" d="5310">essay, you know, and the sentences are just
awful. This person, like God only knows where</p>
<p t="3783700" d="7000">they learned to write—probably in a high
school somewhere. And, you know, it’s incomprehensible,</p>
<p t="3790700" d="3230">but if you read the whole thing you think,
“Man, there’s an idea in here.” You</p>
<p t="3793930" d="3820">know, the person is smarter than their ability
to write. And so then you can write—you</p>
<p t="3797750" d="3930">can say, “Look, you can’t write worth
a damn but, you know, you’re pretty smart</p>
<p t="3801680" d="4070">and you’ve got some ideas in here that if
you could articulate might be of really high</p>
<p t="3805750" d="3970">quality.” So, you can be wrong in the details
and right in the overall picture and Freud</p>
<p t="3809720" d="1550">was like that all the time.</p>
<p t="3811270" d="14180">And Freud was also unbeatable in relationship
to familial pathology. So, from Freud’s</p>
<p t="3825450" d="7770">perspective, the fundamental task of the emerging
human being was to extricate themselves from</p>
<p t="3833220" d="4260">their family. Now, you might think, “Well
why is that such a problem?” Well, here’s</p>
<p t="3837480" d="5270">a couple of reasons. Well, first, your parents
take care of you so like maybe you don’t</p>
<p t="3842750" d="5160">want to dispense with that too early, especially
if they really really take care of you. And</p>
<p t="3847910" d="3970">that’s the Oedipal situation from the Freudian
perspective. It’s like, the Oedipal’s</p>
<p t="3851880" d="6330">situation arises when you have a parent—or
two parents—who do so much for you that</p>
<p t="3858210" d="5140">you’re no longer able to do anything for
yourself. And that is not a good situation;</p>
<p t="3863350" d="5200">it’s extraordinarily pathological. And there
is nobody like Freud who lays out the details</p>
<p t="3868550" d="3750">of that pathology. And we’re going to watch
a movie, “Crumb” it’s called, which</p>
<p t="3872300" d="4220">is a very disturbing movie—which I suppose
is a trigger warning for those of you who</p>
<p t="3876520" d="4970">think you need trigger warnings. It’s a
very very distressing documentary but it will</p>
<p t="3881490" d="5480">show you Freudian psychopathology like you’ve
never seen it—unless you happen to live</p>
<p t="3886970" d="2360">in a thoroughly Oedipal family.</p>
<p t="3889330" d="5380">Alright. So, look, I didn’t get through the
whole outline. I’ll tell you very briefly</p>
<p t="3894710" d="4720">what you’re going to be required to do and
then we’ll continue this is the next lecture.</p>
<p t="3899430" d="5630">So, there’s three exams: two midterms and
a final. They’re multiple choice. Okay,</p>
<p t="3905060" d="3620">I’ll post some of the questions before the
exam so that you know what you’re getting</p>
<p t="3908680" d="4840">into. I don’t think they’re particularly
difficult; some of you will beg to differ.</p>
<p t="3913520" d="4680">There’s pressure on us this year to curve
the grades so beware. I may have to do that</p>
<p t="3918200" d="4680">okay just—and you need to know that. You
have to write an essay: 750 words. That’s</p>
<p t="3922880" d="6260">not a very long essay but that makes it actually
more difficult. The sign-up for the topics</p>
<p t="3929140" d="4930">of the essay are on the website. You can just
go there and sign up. There’s twenty different</p>
<p t="3934070" d="4150">topics and there’s fifteen slots for each
topic so I would recommend that you do that</p>
<p t="3938220" d="6460">quite quickly. You have to do a personality
self-analysis: 7.5 percent of your grade.</p>
<p t="3944680" d="7630">The link to that is online too. You can get
started on that whenever you want.</p>
<p t="3952310" d="5690">Your TA—one of them—that’s Christine
Brophy; she’s over there in the corner patiently</p>
<p t="3958000" d="5780">waiting for me to introduce her. She has office
hours; they’re posted online. You can sign</p>
<p t="3963780" d="6050">up for her office hours online. You can also
sign up for my office hours online. So, well</p>
<p t="3969830" d="5730">that’s halfway through what the course is
going to be about. So, we’ll see you on Thursday.</p>
