<p t="32800" d="4279">Maybe you’re 35-years-old and you’ve never
had a job.</p>
<p t="37079" d="4531">And one of the things that’s stopping you
is that you’re so damned nervous that you</p>
<p t="41610" d="4440">can’t pick up a phone and use it, because
if anything unexpected happens while you’re</p>
<p t="46050" d="2730">talking, you get scared so badly you have
to hang up.</p>
<p t="48780" d="3059">And so, that would be characteristic of somebody
with a severe anxiety disorder.</p>
<p t="51839" d="1371">So, what do you do with that person?</p>
<p t="53210" d="2710">So, you say: Oh, are they afraid of the phone?</p>
<p t="55920" d="1470">Well, no.</p>
<p t="57390" d="1000">What are they afraid of?</p>
<p t="58390" d="3259">Well, they’re afraid of anomalies in human
interaction, right?</p>
<p t="61649" d="3651">And they’re afraid of something unexpected
happening while they’re trying to impose</p>
<p t="65300" d="1000">a structure.</p>
<p t="66300" d="3420">And the reason they’re afraid of that is
‘cause they never learned that they were</p>
<p t="69720" d="5920">capable of dealing with the emergence of something
new on an ongoing basis, which meant that…</p>
<p t="75640" d="5490">Well, which meant in all likelihood that,
when they were children, they were so sheltered</p>
<p t="81130" d="5640">from any contact with those aspects of being
that transcend knowledge that they never learned</p>
<p t="86770" d="3800">that there was something inside of them that
would reveal itself if they were allowed the</p>
<p t="90570" d="7100">opportunity to encounter the unknown; to encounter
fear, then to master it, then to extract out</p>
<p t="97670" d="1000">something of value.</p>
<p t="98670" d="2690">So, they can’t get a job because they can’t
use the phone.</p>
<p t="101360" d="2300">And it isn’t because they can’t use the
phone, right?</p>
<p t="103660" d="1850">It’s a deeper story than that.</p>
<p t="105510" d="5249">It’s because they’re terrified of this
and they have no idea that they have some</p>
<p t="110759" d="3481">resource they could draw on to combat it.</p>
<p t="114240" d="3239">And you could say: Well, we can teach them
to use the phone, right?</p>
<p t="117479" d="5551">Say: Well, you know, here’s a repertoire
of stock lines that you might use, you know,</p>
<p t="123030" d="1650">like small talk at a party.</p>
<p t="124680" d="4639">And that would increase what they know and
enable them to deal with the unknown.</p>
<p t="129319" d="2741">Or you could say: Look, you know, relax a
little bit.</p>
<p t="132060" d="4330">When the person says something on the phone
that you don’t understand, pause a little</p>
<p t="136390" d="1000">bit.</p>
<p t="137390" d="1000">Think about what they’re saying.</p>
<p t="138390" d="1210">Pay attention to them.</p>
<p t="139600" d="2240">Allow yourself the luxury of formulating a
response.</p>
<p t="141840" d="1610">You’ll do fine.</p>
<p t="143450" d="3890">And even if you do it badly the first half
a dozen times, well, you’ll learn eventually.</p>
<p t="147340" d="5410">And the person derives from that the notion
that, not only can they cope on the phone,</p>
<p t="152750" d="9510">but that possibly, there’s more to them
that originally met the eye</p>
<p t="162260" d="6810">We come into the world equipped with an array
of… possibilities and limitations.</p>
<p t="169070" d="4850">And those possibilities and limitations are
expressed most particularly in our physical</p>
<p t="173920" d="6330">form; the fact that we have a specific kind
of embodied form that allows us to do certain</p>
<p t="180250" d="4470">things, and it also doesn’t allow us to
do certain other things.</p>
<p t="184720" d="8120">Lao Tzu has pointed out that it’s the space
inside a pot that makes the pot worthwhile.</p>
<p t="192840" d="6650">And… what he means by that is that… those
things that limit you give you as much form</p>
<p t="199490" d="3850">and possibility, as those things that enable
you.</p>
<p t="203340" d="3150">What that means, more broadly, is the fact
that you’ve come to a given circumstance</p>
<p t="206490" d="2890">with a set of possibilities and a set of limitations.</p>
<p t="209380" d="5540">It’s that, that allows you to impose form
on what you encounter, so that the whole notion</p>
<p t="214920" d="5670">of form is a tenet in some peculiar way that
we don’t really understand yet on the necessity</p>
<p t="220590" d="1780">of limitation.</p>
<p t="222370" d="3500">And I think the best way to understand that,
or to begin to understand that, is to give</p>
<p t="225870" d="2150">some consideration to the notion of a game.</p>
<p t="228020" d="4610">So, for example, if you’re playing chess,
there’s a virtually unlimited number of</p>
<p t="232630" d="5360">things you can’t do, and only a very narrow
number of things that you can do.</p>
<p t="237990" d="4670">Yet, when you’re playing chess, the arbitrary
limitations that are imposed on each piece</p>
<p t="242660" d="3400">don’t seem to be unfair in any sort of cosmic
sense.</p>
<p t="246060" d="4620">They seem to be part of the structure that
enables you to actually play the game.</p>
<p t="250680" d="3639">Without the imposition of those rules, which
are of course relatively arbitrary in the</p>
<p t="254319" d="2491">structure, there wouldn’t be a game at all.</p>
<p t="256810" d="7120">Now, it’s clear that, for human beings,
games and fantasy for that matter shade up</p>
<p t="263930" d="4750">into reality, so that the game structures
that we engage in and the fantasy structures</p>
<p t="268680" d="5630">that we use to under­gird our stories and
our pretend play, say when we’re children,</p>
<p t="274310" d="2460">shade imperceptibly into real life.</p>
<p t="276770" d="4980">We­We play games because there’s something
about games that make them deeply analogous</p>
<p t="281750" d="2250">to what we do in day­to­day situations.</p>
<p t="284000" d="5490">And that means, the observation that the rules
of a game actually make the game possible</p>
<p t="289490" d="5649">is an observation that’s broadly applicable
to consideration of your own limitation</p>
<p t="295139" d="5071">Some of those limitations and possibilities
take the form of emotions and motivations,</p>
<p t="300210" d="6780">and we know, I think, incontrovertibly regardless
of the claims of social scientists who are</p>
<p t="306990" d="4929">more relativist in their orientation, that
human beings come into the world with a standard</p>
<p t="311919" d="4560">set of biological predispositions – emotions
and motivations.</p>
<p t="316479" d="4701">And furthermore, I think we know that it’s
the fact of those shared emotions and motivations</p>
<p t="321180" d="7079">that allow us to communicate at all.</p>
<p t="328259" d="6121">And then, imagine further that a consequence
of that… lengthy process of interpersonal</p>
<p t="334380" d="5890">negotiation is the emergence of a tremendously
complicated game, and not one that’s arbitrary,</p>
<p t="340270" d="3829">because the game has to have certain rules
in order for it to be played at all.</p>
<p t="344099" d="6130">So, for example, we know that even with rats,
If rats-- They like to engage in rough-and-tumble</p>
<p t="350229" d="5590">play, and if you put two rats together – juvenile
rats – one rat almost always dominates the</p>
<p t="355819" d="1000">other.</p>
<p t="356819" d="5340">It only takes about a 10% gain in weight on
the part of one rat for it to be pretty much</p>
<p t="362159" d="1461">stability dominant.</p>
<p t="363620" d="5530">And it’s always the subordinate rat that
introduces play, or-or-or uh, asks for play.</p>
<p t="369150" d="6650">But it turns out that even among rats, if
the dominant rat pins, or… or-or obtains</p>
<p t="375800" d="4990">victory over the subordinate rat more than
70% of the time, the subordinate rat will</p>
<p t="380790" d="1360">no longer play</p>
<p t="382150" d="3620">So then, you could imagine likewise that if
you’re going to play a game with some other</p>
<p t="385770" d="5619">person, whether it’s a game of fantasy or
the actual chance to engage in some cooperative</p>
<p t="391389" d="6131">real-world activity, unless that person allows
you a certain amount of space for the manifestation</p>
<p t="397520" d="3560">of your own emotional and motivational needs,
you’re not going to play the game with them,</p>
<p t="401080" d="1000">right?</p>
<p t="402080" d="1000">You’re going to look for another game.</p>
<p t="403080" d="4760">And that means that there’s a certain set
of difficult-to-describe constraints for all</p>
<p t="407840" d="8090">of you on games that you’re willing to play
before you’ll look for another game.</p>
<p t="415930" d="6729">Well, and then, you could start to conceive
of revolutionary tendencies in that sense,</p>
<p t="422659" d="1000">right?</p>
<p t="423659" d="4570">Imagine a human society that’s got so unstable
that the vast majority of the citizens within</p>
<p t="428229" d="2180">that society are subjugated to starvation.</p>
<p t="430409" d="4100">So, the society never­­ no longer provides
their basic needs.</p>
<p t="434509" d="3731">And constant tyranny, you could imagine as
well, that there’s going to be an innate</p>
<p t="438240" d="5200">tendency among the members of that society
to start hypothesizing about what alternatives</p>
<p t="443440" d="4699">might be possible, right; to start dreaming
about alternative societies, and then also,</p>
<p t="448139" d="3421">to take action if the situation becomes too
extreme.</p>
<p t="451560" d="3990">And I think this is part of the reason why
you see stable mythological motifs across</p>
<p t="455550" d="5339">different cultures It’s not so much like
Jung said that we have archetypes of what</p>
<p t="460889" d="3870">might constitute social order, deeply embedded
in our unconscious.</p>
<p t="464759" d="6390">I think this­this situation is more externalized
than that in that, what’s biological is</p>
<p t="471149" d="3910">what we bring to the situation – our hopes
and our desires, and the fact that we have</p>
<p t="475059" d="1040">hopes and desires.</p>
<p t="476099" d="5790">Now, I think what happens with stories is
something like this; is that, as human societies</p>
<p t="481889" d="4000">increase in complexity and numbers – so,
they become bigger and bigger – and more</p>
<p t="485889" d="5231">and more people engage in the negotiating
process, exchanging emotional and motivation</p>
<p t="491120" d="4470">information, the pattern that this society
takes, if it’s going to be stable across</p>
<p t="495590" d="4099">long periods of time, starts to become encoded
in the stories.</p>
<p t="499689" d="3271">So imagine, you got your emotions and your
motivations.</p>
<p t="502960" d="1590">You make your case known.</p>
<p t="504550" d="4789">Ten thousand other people do that over a thousand
years, and structure starts to emerge that</p>
<p t="509339" d="6091">satisfies, more or less, all of these emotions
and motivational states, and is also recognizable</p>
<p t="515430" d="6099">as a pattern</p>
<p t="521529" d="4781">So then, you could say, for example, considering
a story like Moses and the imposition of the</p>
<p t="526310" d="5839">Ten Commandments on the ancient Hebrews, prior
to his imposition of those Ten Commandments</p>
<p t="532149" d="4531">– of course, there were actually many more
than ten, Moses - according to the mythological</p>
<p t="536680" d="6530">story – Moses spent years, literally years,
adjudicating conflict between the people that</p>
<p t="543210" d="1000">he was leading.</p>
<p t="544210" d="4250">18 hours a day, they’d come to him with
their various problems, saying: We have a</p>
<p t="548460" d="1000">dispute.</p>
<p t="549460" d="1000">How should it be settled?</p>
<p t="550460" d="1000">And he’d settle it.</p>
<p t="551460" d="5080">Well, imagine doing that for ten years, right;
becoming an expert at evaluating what constitutes</p>
<p t="556540" d="4200">an appropriate solution to an emotional problem
between two people.</p>
<p t="560740" d="4830">Imagine, as well, that as a consequence of
doing that for such a long period of time,</p>
<p t="565570" d="6120">you start to became-- become to abstract out,
lawful regularities in the manner in which</p>
<p t="571690" d="3690">people have to interact in order for peace
to be maintained.</p>
<p t="575380" d="4510">Imagine further that those could be codified
in stories but, even more, codified as law</p>
<p t="579890" d="5471">eventually when consciousness became capable
of grasping, explicitly, the nature of the</p>
<p t="585361" d="1000">interactions</p>
<p t="586361" d="4509">So, my point is a point very much like Nietzsche’s
– because Nietzsche said at the end of the</p>
<p t="590870" d="5550">19th Century that it’s a mistake to presume
that most of our philosophies are rational</p>
<p t="596420" d="1109">in nature.</p>
<p t="597529" d="5141">And I think that’s a mistake that characterizes
Western philosophical thinking, at least since</p>
<p t="602670" d="1000">the Enlightenment.</p>
<p t="603670" d="5950">It’s a mistake to assume that there was
a chaotic social state upon which a rational</p>
<p t="609620" d="3089">order was imposed as a consequence of rational
action.</p>
<p t="612709" d="5511">It’s much more reasonable to presuppose
that the order emerged naturally, over lengthy</p>
<p t="618220" d="5229">periods of time, and then was interpreted
and codified and given structure in a secondary</p>
<p t="623449" d="1000">manner.</p>
<p t="624449" d="4191">And so, what I’m trying to outline for you
in large part is the processes by which that</p>
<p t="628640" d="1160">order comes to be.</p>
<p t="629800" d="3670">So, you say, first, it’s behavioural, emotional,
motivational.</p>
<p t="633470" d="4510">People, and even animals, communicate in a
way that makes their motivational and emotional</p>
<p t="637980" d="1140">needs known to one another.</p>
<p t="639120" d="4601">So, even among wolves and chimpanzees and
any kind of lower-order social animal, you</p>
<p t="643721" d="5459">have the emergence of dominance hierarchies,
fundamentally, which are stable solutions</p>
<p t="649180" d="4089">to the entire set of emotional and motivational
problems that besets the group.</p>
<p t="653269" d="5171">And no one would ever say that the emergence
of a chimpanzee dominance hierarchy is a consequence</p>
<p t="658440" d="2310">of rational deliberation.</p>
<p t="660750" d="4019">So then, imagine that chimpanzees get the
power to watch what they’re doing and to</p>
<p t="664769" d="1541">start to represent it.</p>
<p t="666310" d="5210">And then, imagine furthermore that that representation
takes the form of stories and, then, laws.</p>
<p t="671520" d="4150">And then, you have some idea about h-how human
social order comes to be.</p>
<p t="675670" d="4729">And this is an exciting possibility for me
because it offers-- it offers the potential</p>
<p t="680399" d="6931">solution to one major question, which is:
How is it that people should act?</p>
<p t="687330" d="4369">And because we’re essentially rationalist
in our presuppositions, we believe that there</p>
<p t="691699" d="2180">are rationalist solutions to that.</p>
<p t="693879" d="5971">But the solutions may be something that are
much more akin to biological solutions.</p>
<p t="699850" d="7520">So, first, I want you to consider the following
hypothesis.</p>
<p t="707370" d="4199">OK, so, we’re going to make the presupposition
– a couple of presuppositions that I don’t</p>
<p t="711569" d="3570">think are unreasonable – first, is that
we are essentially animals, that we’ve evolved</p>
<p t="715139" d="6570">in a Darwinian fashion; and second, that the
consequence of that evolution - much of which</p>
<p t="721709" d="4560">was precognitive, right – uh, that we-we
were around as creatures before we were capable</p>
<p t="726269" d="4791">of thinking in words, to say, much of that
evolutionary history has conditioned the manner</p>
<p t="731060" d="1000">in which we think.</p>
<p t="732060" d="3600">So, we think more like biological entities
than we think like computers.</p>
<p t="735660" d="4280">Or, we think more like biological entities
than we think like rational machines.</p>
<p t="739940" d="5040">But of course, we already know that rational
machines cannot think very well, except in</p>
<p t="744980" d="4200">very bounded environments, ‘cause they don’t
have access to an embodied structure or to</p>
<p t="749180" d="2050">emotions and motivations.</p>
<p t="751230" d="1570">So, let’s…</p>
<p t="752800" d="6599">So then, you might say: Well, why is it that,
like, in the Mesopotamian and Egyptian creation</p>
<p t="759399" d="6750">myths, our most fundamental representations
of the world tend to take story form and that,</p>
<p t="766149" d="5130">not only do they take story form, but they
tend to utilize certain kinds of categories.</p>
<p t="771279" d="2591">Now, I’ve showed you this diagram before.</p>
<p t="773870" d="4709">Uhmm, this represents what I think are the
three cardinal categories of experience.</p>
<p t="778579" d="3961">So, there’s the great mother who’s holding
the world in her hand here.</p>
<p t="782540" d="4229">And inside her subordinate – in a sense
– is the great father.</p>
<p t="786769" d="2421">This is a Christian representation obviously.</p>
<p t="789190" d="6759">And then, the tragic son of course, in the
crowd here representing society, is adoring</p>
<p t="795949" d="6370">the figure of the tragic hero here because
they regard his mode of being as necessary</p>
<p t="802319" d="4471">to their own salvation so to speak – their
own proper mode of living.</p>
<p t="806790" d="2900">OK, so then, you think: Well, why these characters?</p>
<p t="809690" d="7410">And I’d offer you this possibility is, first
of all, every human being that’s ever lived</p>
<p t="817100" d="4179">has lived in an environment characterized
by the presence of these three entities, right?</p>
<p t="821279" d="1110">We have mothers.</p>
<p t="822389" d="1000">We have fathers.</p>
<p t="823389" d="2161">And we exist as individuals.</p>
<p t="825550" d="4520">And then, you think: Well, when you’re a
child and you begin to comprehend the world,</p>
<p t="830070" d="3749">the outside world, everything outside of the
family is of course vague and ill-defined,</p>
<p t="833819" d="2591">right, non-existent in a sense.</p>
<p t="836410" d="6660">And all there is for you to observe is the
mother, who for you really is the whole world,</p>
<p t="843070" d="5440">and the father, a-a secondary source of comfort
and trouble perhaps, and the fact of your</p>
<p t="848510" d="1000">own individuality.</p>
<p t="849510" d="4470">And so, you say: Well, that’s true from
the perspective of individual development.</p>
<p t="853980" d="5159">But then, if you go way, way back in history
– maybe 500,000 years when our cognitive</p>
<p t="859139" d="3360">capacities were first starting to develop
– and we were trying to figure out what</p>
<p t="862499" d="5361">the world was really like, what categories
would we have at our disposal to start to</p>
<p t="867860" d="3349">modify and change in order to represent the
outside world.</p>
<p t="871209" d="4831">And then, you might think: You can only talk
about what you don’t know in terms that</p>
<p t="876040" d="1570">you know.</p>
<p t="877610" d="3229">And since, for the child, the mother is the
world.</p>
<p t="880839" d="7221">It isn’t absurd to presume that for the
human being, the world is the mother, first,</p>
<p t="888060" d="7959">as a projection, right, as an a priori, cognitive
schema.</p>
<p t="896019" d="6031">The hypothesis being: The natural world which
of course manifest itself in truth in the</p>
<p t="902050" d="4909">mother – partakes in many ways of the same
properties as the mother.</p>
<p t="906959" d="5392">It’s a working hypothesis, just like you
might presume if you date a new woman, that</p>
<p t="912351" d="4709">she has aspects of your sister – all things
considered – aspects of your mother, given</p>
<p t="917060" d="1740">that they were also female.</p>
<p t="918800" d="4620">You take what you know to represent what you
don’t know.</p>
<p t="923420" d="6680">So, we use our fundamental, social cognitive
categories initially to portray the world.</p>
<p t="930100" d="4739">And the world’s nature is portray and personified,
or metaphorical form.</p>
<p t="934839" d="3290">And so then, the question is: What are the
primary categories?</p>
<p t="938129" d="2400">Well, we have three of them here.</p>
<p t="940529" d="3800">But they’re not the only three because this
is all good, this category system – the</p>
<p t="944329" d="2981">benevolent mother, the benevolent father,
and the hero.</p>
<p t="947310" d="4189">Well, we know the world is not only benevolent,
it’s also malevolent.</p>
<p t="951499" d="5250">Or at least, we can say that because we’re
equipped with certain emotional possibilities</p>
<p t="956749" d="6960">and certain motivational possibilities the
probability that we will encounter despair</p>
<p t="963709" d="5841">and frustration and disappointment, and anxiety
is just as real as the possibility that we</p>
<p t="969550" d="2430">will encounter and hope, and satisfaction.</p>
<p t="971980" d="2700">So, for us, the world is bivalent.</p>
<p t="974680" d="2070">It takes with one and it gives with the other.</p>
<p t="976750" d="5040">And that’s true for the natural world, which
produces us and destroys; as it is for the</p>
<p t="981790" d="5190">social world, which fosters our development
and crushes our individuality; and as well</p>
<p t="986980" d="4810">for the individual, who in many regards is
as admirable a creature as you can hope ever</p>
<p t="991790" d="5589">to propose and, at the same time, someone
who’s capable of unbelievable depths of</p>
<p t="997379" d="1810">depravity.</p>
<p t="999189" d="6991">So… a world that’s not only divided into
three fundamental categories, but each category</p>
<p t="1006180" d="5909">divided into a structure that’s essentially
ambivalent in its fundamental element.</p>
<p t="1012089" d="5341">And of course, that poses the central existential
problem for human existence, doesn’t it?</p>
<p t="1017430" d="5009">I mean, we’re faced with the vagaries of
the natural world and what we don’t understand;</p>
<p t="1022439" d="4341">he vagaries of the social world and its often
arbitrary and unreasonable demands on us;</p>
<p t="1026780" d="5200">and the fact of our capacity for transcendence,
tied to our own vulnerability.</p>
<p t="1031980" d="4400">And you could say perfectly reasonably that,
regardless of where you’re situated in time</p>
<p t="1036380" d="2449">and space, those are basically your problems.</p>
<p t="1038829" d="4411">And your goal through life – your path through
life – is going to be characterized by the</p>
<p t="1043240" d="5440">solutions you either come up with or don’t
come up with to that set of problems.</p>
<p t="1048680" d="9850">OK, so, there’s one more categorical element
that complicates this picture.</p>
<p t="1058530" d="3750">And I think, in many ways, it’s the most
difficult thing there is to grasp.</p>
<p t="1062280" d="2160">So, we’ll take a shot at it first.</p>
<p t="1064440" d="3970">And I’ve showed you this representation
before.</p>
<p t="1068410" d="6110">This is the dragon of chaos, and you can think
of the dragon of chaos as a symbol of totality.</p>
<p t="1074520" d="9790">And furthermore, you can think of it in relationship
to this structure… as the source of this</p>
<p t="1084310" d="4980">structure… or even as the source of all
structure.</p>
<p t="1089290" d="5150">So, you see in the Sumerian creation myth,
for example, the character of Tiamat, right?</p>
<p t="1094440" d="5330">And I told you that the world Tiamat is associated
with the later Hebrew word “Taom”, which</p>
<p t="1099770" d="1000">means chaos.</p>
<p t="1100770" d="4420">And Taom is the chaos that Yahweh makes order
out of; makes the world out of.</p>
<p t="1105190" d="4710">So, the idea lurking behind the Sumerian creation
myth - and then, later, lurking behind the</p>
<p t="1109900" d="5720">entire edifice of Judaism-Christianity and
Islam for that matter - is that something</p>
<p t="1115620" d="5730">that can be best represented by this figure
is best conceptualized as the ground of everything</p>
<p t="1121350" d="1000">that exists.</p>
<p t="1122350" d="2190">Now, what in the world can that mean?</p>
<p t="1124540" d="2410">Well, it means something like this.</p>
<p t="1126950" d="3200">Let’s look at the concrete metaphorical
representation.</p>
<p t="1130150" d="3550">And first of all, you have a kind of totality
here, right?</p>
<p t="1133700" d="4110">You have a thing that can live by devouring
itself.</p>
<p t="1137810" d="2721">So, it has no need of anything outside of
it.</p>
<p t="1140531" d="1939">In fact, there is nothing outside of it.</p>
<p t="1142470" d="2990">It’s a figure of absolute totality.</p>
<p t="1145460" d="5870">And it’s characterized by a strange intermixture
of metaphorical representations of matter</p>
<p t="1151330" d="4390">– because a snake is something that crawls
on the ground – and spirit – because a</p>
<p t="1155720" d="4670">winged serpent is something that can fly and,
therefore, partakes of the metaphorical realm</p>
<p t="1160390" d="3570">of heaven - heaven and earth, right?</p>
<p t="1163960" d="2200">Totality--Yin and Yang, from the Daoist perspective.</p>
<p t="1166160" d="2130">That’s the entire world.</p>
<p t="1168290" d="4390">And it’s also something that’s characterized
by the capacity for transformation because</p>
<p t="1172680" d="2700">a snake can shed its skin and be reborn.</p>
<p t="1175380" d="6300">So, it’s something that’s constantly renewing
itself, despite its absolutely archaic age.</p>
<p t="1181680" d="4890">And it’s also something that presents a
terrible danger and tremendous opportunity,</p>
<p t="1186570" d="4360">because a dragon is something that will burn
you if you get anywhere near it, but also</p>
<p t="1190930" d="4350">hordes a treasure that’s more valuable than
anything else.</p>
<p t="1195280" d="4990">Eliade has pointed out that in traditional,
classic creation myths - the Sumerian myth</p>
<p t="1200270" d="8440">being one example, the hero when he encounters
the first the great dragon of chaos he first</p>
<p t="1208710" d="3680">either runs away or is paralyzed by fright.</p>
<p t="1212390" d="5100">The world in itself is a complex array of
patterns.</p>
<p t="1217490" d="4840">And those patterns manifest themselves in
space, and they manifest themselves in time.</p>
<p t="1222330" d="4510">And I think the best way to get a grip on
what those patterns might be like is to think</p>
<p t="1226840" d="1810">of them in terms of music.</p>
<p t="1228650" d="2210">And I think that’s what music represents.</p>
<p t="1230860" d="7440">Music is this complex three-dimensional structure,
full of interwoven patterns of different dimensions</p>
<p t="1238300" d="2920">and length that expends itself over time.</p>
<p t="1241220" d="4340">And if you listen to a piece of music, you
can concentrate on one instrument or another,</p>
<p t="1245560" d="4140">or you can concentrate on a phrase, or you
can concentrate on the entire melody or the</p>
<p t="1249700" d="1000">voice.</p>
<p t="1250700" d="3230">You can parse out different elements from
the complex background.</p>
<p t="1253930" d="3740">And that’s especially the case with very
sophisticated orchestral music, right, which</p>
<p t="1257670" d="6600">is susceptible to multiple reinterpretations,
and multiple encounters, because of its complexity.</p>
<p t="1264270" d="6820">And this is to say only that what you look
at is far more complicated than what you see.</p>
<p t="1271090" d="4720">Or to say, alternatively, that there’s more
information in anything you perceive than</p>
<p t="1275810" d="3150">you can ever get complete access to.</p>
<p t="1278960" d="6190">And that’s partly because, It’s partly
because your perceptual systems delude you.</p>
<p t="1285150" d="4000">So, we think you look with your eyes or with
your other senses.</p>
<p t="1289150" d="3370">But that’s only true when you’re looking
at what you already know what to look at,</p>
<p t="1292520" d="1000">right?</p>
<p t="1293520" d="4800">When you’ve already built perceptual machinery
that enables you to detect a particular object.</p>
<p t="1298320" d="4460">But when you’re looking at what you don’t
know what to look at, the way you look is</p>
<p t="1302780" d="1390">by getting nervous, right?</p>
<p t="1304170" d="2440">It’s not-- It’s not precisely a perceptual
function.</p>
<p t="1306610" d="3520">It’s something much more deeper and primordial
than that.</p>
<p t="1310130" d="3150">And it’s more like: Oh no.</p>
<p t="1313280" d="3630">Something that I cannot categorize – either
perceptually or cognitively – something</p>
<p t="1316910" d="3460">that I do not know how to respond to has just
occurred.</p>
<p t="1320370" d="3060">And the first categorization is this: That’s
it.</p>
<p t="1323430" d="1650">There’s-There’s nothing under that.</p>
<p t="1325080" d="4660">It’s merely fear plus heightened attention.</p>
<p t="1329740" d="4130">And that prepares the ground for constructing
a more detailed representation.</p>
<p t="1333870" d="11210">But that first encounter, that’s the encounter
with the dragon of chaos.</p>
<p t="1345080" d="5810">So then, you take this figure – the source
of all things, the… the Dao in some ways</p>
<p t="1350890" d="4760">– and you say: Well, how does it manifest
itself?</p>
<p t="1355650" d="10950">And the answer to that is something like this:
And, we see this both in the-- in-in the Mesopotamian</p>
<p t="1366600" d="3600">and the Egyptian myths that I described to
you.</p>
<p t="1370200" d="4560">The first division of the great dragon of
chaos, or the primordial egg is always into</p>
<p t="1374760" d="4910">two subordinate elements: The great father,
and the great mother.</p>
<p t="1379670" d="1320">Why is that?</p>
<p t="1380990" d="5970">Well, it’s illustrative of a fundamental--
of the fundamental binary nature of existence,</p>
<p t="1386960" d="7360">I guess; partly, you could say: If you’re
a cognizant being – a defined delimited</p>
<p t="1394320" d="4290">being – what you perceive always has a binary
structure.</p>
<p t="1398610" d="3760">There’s the aspect of you that structured
enough to allow the perceiving.</p>
<p t="1402370" d="1320">That’s what you know.</p>
<p t="1403690" d="4430">That’s-That’s the manner in which you’re
structured so that you can even… so that-that</p>
<p t="1408120" d="5850">you can even formulate a perception – something
a child builds up over time from the primordial</p>
<p t="1413970" d="5420">aspect, say, of his visual system or his auditory
system; learns to parse up the world by generating</p>
<p t="1419390" d="4610">machinery that allows the complex patterns
that make up the world to be turned into objects.</p>
<p t="1424000" d="4720">So, there’s the thing - the structure that
allows the perceiving and then, there’s</p>
<p t="1428720" d="3050">the thing that’s being perceived</p>
<p t="1431770" d="1130">or the thing behind that.</p>
<p t="1432900" d="2160">And this is a very complicated distinction.</p>
<p t="1435060" d="5230">You can say: Well, what’s the difference
between the dragon of chaos - say, the representation</p>
<p t="1440290" d="5780">of the cosmos as such - and the great mother?</p>
<p t="1446070" d="3850">And I would say, it’s something like this…</p>
<p t="1449920" d="6170">The unknown that appears in relationship to
a perceiver is different than the unknown</p>
<p t="1456090" d="1000">as such.</p>
<p t="1457090" d="4640">So, I would say this, for example: There are
going to be things that surprise you that</p>
<p t="1461730" d="2530">wouldn’t surprise me, and vice versa.</p>
<p t="1464260" d="4690">And the things that would surprise you have
to be construed in relationship to what you--</p>
<p t="1468950" d="4500">to what you already know, ‘cause you’re
only going to be surprised by things you don’t</p>
<p t="1473450" d="1000">know.</p>
<p t="1474450" d="3060">And likewise for me, I’m only going to be
surprised by things I don’t know.</p>
<p t="1477510" d="2070">But what we know is going to vary somewhat.</p>
<p t="1479580" d="5120">So, the unknown for you is going to be different
than the unknown for me.</p>
<p t="1484700" d="6550">And the great mother is a representation of
the unknown for you, for the unknown for me.</p>
<p t="1491250" d="4140">Different for everyone in some sense, because
we’re all going to be…</p>
<p t="1495390" d="5590">We’re all …all-all going to be stymied
and stalked by different aspects of being;</p>
<p t="1500980" d="4870">but the same, as well, in that when you encounter
things you don’t understand, and you encounter</p>
<p t="1505850" d="5410">things you don’t understand, in many, many
ways, you’re going to react to those different</p>
<p t="1511260" d="1490">things the same way.</p>
<p t="1512750" d="2720">And I can give you a narrative illustration
of this.</p>
<p t="1515470" d="3900">King Arthur’s knights-- They sit around
the round table.</p>
<p t="1519370" d="3220">They’re all equals, that’s why they sit
around the round table, right?</p>
<p t="1522590" d="1000">They have a king.</p>
<p t="1523590" d="2480">The king determines their destinies, like
Marduk does.</p>
<p t="1526070" d="1090">But they’re still all equal.</p>
<p t="1527160" d="2090">They determine they’re going to go look
for the Holy Grail.</p>
<p t="1529250" d="1600">It’s the symbol of redemption.</p>
<p t="1530850" d="6180">So, they’re off to find the highest value,
like, Pinocchio wishing on a star - the highest</p>
<p t="1537030" d="1000">value.</p>
<p t="1538030" d="3380">And they all enter the forest to begin their
quest, but they each enter it at the place</p>
<p t="1541410" d="1980">that appears darkest to each of them, right?</p>
<p t="1543390" d="3480">So, that means they all go on different--
They all go in different directions; even</p>
<p t="1546870" d="4790">though they’re on the same quest that theoretically,
they’re inhabiting the same space.</p>
<p t="1551660" d="6380">So… so, it’s only to say that every person
has their demons, so to speak, and that those</p>
<p t="1558040" d="4500">demons differ from person to person, even
though there are things you can say about</p>
<p t="1562540" d="2410">the demons that are common across people.</p>
<p t="1564950" d="3670">So we know, for example, from clinical work
– from endless clinical work – that if</p>
<p t="1568620" d="3720">you want to help someone, you identify: OK,
what do you want to do?</p>
<p t="1572340" d="1470">‘cause they need to know that, right?</p>
<p t="1573810" d="1000">And that’s this.</p>
<p t="1574810" d="1000">What do you want to do?</p>
<p t="1575810" d="1000">Where do you want to go?</p>
<p t="1576810" d="2180">What kind of structure do you want to impose
on your world?</p>
<p t="1578990" d="1764">And then, you identify: OK, well, what things
are stopping you?</p>
<p t="1580754" d="1636">What things are stopping you?</p>
<p t="1582390" d="5510">So, then, you look back at the Sumerian creation
myth and you think: Well, there’s Absu,</p>
<p t="1587900" d="1000">right?</p>
<p t="1588900" d="1990">God of the Known, Tiamet’s Consort, right?</p>
<p t="1590890" d="5590">Culture, but there’s also Marduk, and Marduk
is the power – the spirit, the entity – a</p>
<p t="1596480" d="6660">representation of the Sumerian saviour who
goes out to confront this and to make the</p>
<p t="1603140" d="1000">world.</p>
<p t="1604140" d="2760">Well, that’s what you teach people in behavioural
therapy.</p>
<p t="1606900" d="2310">You teach them not so much that.</p>
<p t="1609210" d="2010">You don’t teach them habituation.</p>
<p t="1611220" d="3590">You don’t teach them to get used to things
that they’re afraid of.</p>
<p t="1614810" d="2980">You teach them that there’s something within
them that can respond to the things that they’re</p>
<p t="1617790" d="55530">afraid of - that’s of as great a magnitude
as the fears themselves.</p>
