<p t="12519" d="4429">I&#39;ve thought a long time about what motivates behavior like that</p>
<p t="17529" d="5750">manifested at Columbine and at Sandy Hook and then of course most recently at Parkland and</p>
<p t="23710" d="5420">because of the Parkland event I thought that I would read a chapter from my book to everyone.</p>
<p t="29500" d="6770">It&#39;s Chapter 6, Rule 6, &#39;Set Your House In Perfect Order Before You Criticize The World&#39;</p>
<p t="36489" d="7100">and it&#39;s an extended meditation on the kind of motivations that drive the people who wish to slaughter innocents as a form of revenge against God.</p>
<p t="43840" d="5119">So, I&#39;m going to read it to you and you can let me know what you think.</p>
<p t="51219" d="6140">Rule 6: Set Your House In Perfect Order Before You Criticize The World</p>
<p t="58899" d="2000">A Religious Problem.</p>
<p t="61660" d="2029">It does not seem reasonable to</p>
<p t="64390" d="7309">describe the young man who shot 20 children and 6 staff members at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newton</p>
<p t="71700" d="3959">Connecticut in 2012 as a religious person.</p>
<p t="77650" d="5750">This is equally true for the Colorado theater gunman and the Columbine high school shooters,</p>
<p t="84880" d="6650">but these murderous individuals had a problem with reality that existed at a religious depth.</p>
<p t="92530" d="1409"> </p>
<p t="93939" d="2450">As one of the members of the Columbine duo wrote,</p>
<p t="97270" d="4069">&quot;The human race isn&#39;t worth fighting for - only worth killing.</p>
<p t="102640" d="2000">Give the earth back to the animals,</p>
<p t="104890" d="6080">they deserve it infinitely more than we do. Nothing means anything anymore&quot;.</p>
<p t="114070" d="3229">People who think such things view being itself as</p>
<p t="117880" d="5510">inequitable and harsh to the point of corruption and human being in particular as</p>
<p t="124030" d="1530">contemptible.</p>
<p t="125560" d="2000">They appoint themselves</p>
<p t="127660" d="3949">supreme adjudicators of reality and find it wanting.</p>
<p t="133440" d="2000">They&#39;re the ultimate critics.</p>
<p t="135990" d="2509">The deeply cynical writer continues,</p>
<p t="139590" d="6260">&quot;If you recall your history, the Nazis came up with a final solution to the Jewish problem.</p>
<p t="147270" d="2000">Kill them all.</p>
<p t="149490" d="5479">Well, in case you haven&#39;t figured it out, I say kill mankind,</p>
<p t="156209" d="2000">no one should survive&quot;.</p>
<p t="160050" d="7129">For such individuals the world of experience is  insufficient and evil; so to hell with everything.</p>
<p t="169680" d="3200">What is happening when someone comes to think in this manner.</p>
<p t="173850" d="7039">A great German play, &#39;Faust&#39;, a tragedy written by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe</p>
<p t="181800" d="1800">addresses that issue.</p>
<p t="183600" d="6349">The play&#39;s main character, a scholar named Heinrich Faust, trades his immortal soul to the devil:</p>
<p t="190590" d="2000">Mephistopheles.</p>
<p t="193290" d="4250">In return, he receives whatever he desires while still alive on earth.</p>
<p t="198150" d="6170">In Goethe&#39;s play Mephistopheles is the eternal adversary of being.</p>
<p t="205620" d="3050">He has a central defining credo,</p>
<p t="209700" d="2509">&quot;I am the spirit who negates</p>
<p t="212910" d="1500">and rightly so.</p>
<p t="214440" d="4100">For all that comes to be, deserves to perish wretchedly.</p>
<p t="219980" d="4740">It were better nothing would begin, thus everything that your terms sin,</p>
<p t="225540" d="1740">destruction, evil represent,</p>
<p t="229080" d="2000">that is my proper element.&quot;</p>
<p t="233130" d="7759">Goethe considered this hateful sentiment so important, so key to the central element of vengeful human destructiveness,</p>
<p t="241140" d="3349">that he had Mephistopheles say it a second time</p>
<p t="244860" d="4939">phrased somewhat differently in part two of the play written many years later.</p>
<p t="251310" d="4220">People often think in the Mephistophelian manner, although</p>
<p t="255530" d="6480">they seldom act upon their thoughts as brutally as the mass murderers of School, College and Theater.</p>
<p t="263849" d="7660">Whenever we experience injustice, real or imagined, whenever we encounter tragedy or fall prey to the machinations</p>
<p t="271510" d="1570">of others.</p>
<p t="273080" d="5180">Whenever we experience the horror and pain of our own apparently arbitrary limitations,</p>
<p t="278870" d="5989">the temptation to question being and then to curse it, rises foully from the darkness.</p>
<p t="286880" d="7250">Why must innocent people suffer so terribly? What kind of bloody horrible planet is this, anyway?</p>
<p t="296090" d="6679">Life is, in truth, very hard. Everyone is destined for pain and slated for destruction.</p>
<p t="304940" d="7940">Sometimes suffering is clearly the result of personal faults, such as willful blindness, poor decision-making or malevolence.</p>
<p t="313490" d="1020"> </p>
<p t="314510" d="4880">In such cases, when it appears to be self-inflicted, it may even seem just.</p>
<p t="320450" d="2690">&quot;People get what they deserve&quot;, you might contend.</p>
<p t="324050" d="2990">That&#39;s cold comfort however, even when true.</p>
<p t="327919" d="1321">Sometimes,</p>
<p t="329240" d="5570">if those who are suffering change their behavior, then their lives would unfold less tragically.</p>
<p t="336440" d="2000">But human control is limited,</p>
<p t="339260" d="3859">susceptibility to despair, disease, ageing and death is</p>
<p t="343790" d="1230">universal.</p>
<p t="345020" d="3980">In the final analysis we do not appear to be the architects of our own fragility,</p>
<p t="351590" d="2000">whose fault is it then?</p>
<p t="355130" d="6619">People who are very ill or worse, who have a sick child will inevitably find themselves asking this question,</p>
<p t="362090" d="2119">whether they are religious believers or not.</p>
<p t="366500" d="4910">The same is true of someone who finds his shirtsleeve caught in the gears of a giant bureaucracy,</p>
<p t="371990" d="6380">who is suffering through a tax audit or fighting an interminable lawsuit or divorce</p>
<p t="379460" d="7970">and it&#39;s not only the obviously suffering who are tormented by the need to blame someone or something for the intolerable state of their being.</p>
<p t="389750" d="2000">At the height of his fame,</p>
<p t="391820" d="6960">influence and creative power, for example, the towering Leo Tolstoy himself began to question the value of human</p>
<p t="398980" d="1660">existence</p>
<p t="401020" d="2240">He reasoned in this way:</p>
<p t="405610" d="5000">&quot;My position was terrible. I knew that I could find nothing in the way of rational knowledge</p>
<p t="411190" d="6259">except a denial of life. And in faith, I could find nothing except a denial of reason.</p>
<p t="418090" d="2809">And this was even more impossible than a denial of life.</p>
<p t="423550" d="5510">According to rational knowledge, it followed that life is evil and people know it.</p>
<p t="431350" d="5479">They do not have to live, yet they have lived and they do live just as I myself had lived</p>
<p t="437620" d="5119">even though I had known for a long time that life is meaningless and evil.</p>
<p t="444610" d="2059">Try as he might, Tolstoy could only identify</p>
<p t="447250" d="2569">four means of escaping from such thoughts</p>
<p t="450400" d="1020">One</p>
<p t="451420" d="3290">was retreating into childlike ignorance of the problem.</p>
<p t="456400" d="2359">Another was pursuing mindless pleasure.</p>
<p t="460990" d="1950">The third was</p>
<p t="462940" d="6199">continuing to drag out a life that is evil and meaningless knowing beforehand that nothing can come of it.</p>
<p t="471070" d="3470">He identified that particular form of escape with weakness.</p>
<p t="475150" d="3200">The people in this category know that death is better than life,</p>
<p t="478960" d="5869">but they do not have the strength to act rationally and quickly put an end to the delusion by killing themselves.</p>
<p t="487180" d="3199">Only the fourth and final mode of escape involved</p>
<p t="490690" d="6800">strength and energy. It consists of destroying life once one has realized that life is evil and meaningless.</p>
<p t="499780" d="6529">Tolstoy relentlessly followed his thoughts, only unusually strong and logically consistent people act in this manner</p>
<p t="506800" d="6110">having realized all the stupidity of the joke that is being played on us and seeing that the blessings of the dead</p>
<p t="512980" d="3300">are greater than those of the living and that it is better not to exist,</p>
<p t="516380" d="6980">they act and put an end to this stupid joke. And they use any means of doing it: a rope around the neck,</p>
<p t="524020" d="2360">water, a knife in the heart,</p>
<p t="527110" d="2000">a train.</p>
<p t="530170" d="7489">Tolstoy wasn&#39;t pessimistic enough. The stupidity of the joke being played on us does not merely motivate suicide,</p>
<p t="538660" d="2000">it motivates murder,</p>
<p t="540940" d="3020">mass murder often followed by suicide.</p>
<p t="544980" d="2240">That is a far more effective</p>
<p t="547480" d="2360">existential protest.</p>
<p t="551110" d="6140">By June of 2016, unbelievable as it may seem, there had been 1000 mass killings</p>
<p t="557709" d="3380">defined as four or more people shot in a single incident</p>
<p t="561670" d="4400">excluding the shooter in the U.S. in twelve hundred and sixty days</p>
<p t="566589" d="5360">That&#39;s one such event on five of every six days for more than three years.</p>
<p t="575230" d="2239">Everyone says, &quot;we don&#39;t understand&quot;.</p>
<p t="580029" d="2000">How can we still pretend that?</p>
<p t="582640" d="2690">Tolstoy understood more than a century ago.</p>
<p t="586180" d="3529">Tthe ancient authors of the biblical story of Cain and Abel</p>
<p t="590020" d="2929">understood as well more than twenty centuries ago.</p>
<p t="593080" d="6679">They described murder as the first act of post identic history and not just murder</p>
<p t="600490" d="7309">but fratricidal murder. Murder not only of someone innocent, but of someone ideal and good.</p>
<p t="608860" d="1286">And murder done consciously</p>
<p t="610146" d="3173">to spite the creator of the universe.</p>
<p t="615550" d="4400">Today&#39;s killers tell us the same thing in their own words.</p>
<p t="622300" d="4460">Who would dare say, that this is not the worm at the core of the apple.</p>
<p t="628690" d="3919">But we will not listen, because the truth cuts too close to the bone.</p>
<p t="633279" d="6080">Even for a mind as profound as that of the celebrated Russian author,  there was no way out.</p>
<p t="641020" d="5119">How can the rest of us manage when a man of Tolstoi&#39;s stature admits defeat?</p>
<p t="647529" d="6980">For years he hid his guns from himself and would not walk with a rope in hand in case he hanged himself.</p>
<p t="657130" d="4579">How can a person who is awake avoid outrage at the world?</p>
<p t="665180" d="2000">Vengeance or transformation.</p>
<p t="668360" d="6410">A religious man might shake his fist in desperation at the apparent injustice and blindness of God.</p>
<p t="676670" d="4700">Even Christ himself felt abandoned before the cross or so the story goes.</p>
<p t="682430" d="6890">More agnostic or atheistic individual might blame fate or meditate bitterly on the brutality of chance.</p>
<p t="689660" d="2000">Another might tear himself apart</p>
<p t="692089" d="4460">searching for the character flaws underlying his suffering and deterioration</p>
<p t="699290" d="6919">These are all variations on a theme. The name of the target changes, but the underlying psychology remains constant.</p>
<p t="707120" d="1800">Why?</p>
<p t="708920" d="3500">Why is there so much suffering and cruelty?</p>
<p t="714230" d="2750">Well, perhaps it really is God&#39;s doing</p>
<p t="717500" d="5270">or the fault of blind pointless fate, if you&#39;re inclined to think that way.</p>
<p t="723620" d="2599">And there appears to be every reason to think that way.</p>
<p t="728600" d="2000">But what happens if you do?</p>
<p t="731600" d="5299">Mass murderers believe that the suffering attendant upon existence</p>
<p t="737450" d="5869">justifies judgment and revenge as the Columbine boys so clearly indicated;</p>
<p t="744740" d="4700">&#39;I will sooner die than betray my own thoughts. Before I leave this worthless place,</p>
<p t="749440" d="7380">I will kill whoever I deem unfit for anything, especially life. If you pissed me off in the past,</p>
<p t="757310" d="2000">you will die, if I see you.</p>
<p t="760160" d="4369">You might be able to piss off others and have it eventually all blow over,</p>
<p t="765350" d="2000">but not me.</p>
<p t="767620" d="2120">I don&#39;t forget people who wronged me.&#39;</p>
<p t="772160" d="6980">One of the most vengeful murderers of the 20th century, the terrible Carl Panzram, was raped,</p>
<p t="779200" d="3740">brutalized and betrayed in the Minnesota institution</p>
<p t="783180" d="2400">responsible for his rehabilitation</p>
<p t="785580" d="2469">when he was a delinquent juvenile.</p>
<p t="789140" d="2779">He emerged enraged beyond measure</p>
<p t="792680" d="4309">as a burglar, arsonist, rapists and serial killer.</p>
<p t="797889" d="7229">He aimed consciously and consistently at destruction. Even keeping track of the dollar value of the property he burned.</p>
<p t="806209" d="2869">He started by hating the individuals who had hurt him.</p>
<p t="809869" d="6770">His resentment grew until his hatred encompassed all of mankind, and he didn&#39;t stop there.</p>
<p t="817459" d="5570">His destructiveness was aimed in some fundamental manner at God himself.</p>
<p t="823369" d="2000">There&#39;s no other way of phrasing it,</p>
<p t="825649" d="5869">Panzram raped, murdered and burned to express his outrage at being.</p>
<p t="832699" d="6859">He acted as if someone was responsible. The same thing happens in the story of Cain and Abel.</p>
<p t="840799" d="1141">Cain&#39;s sacrifices</p>
<p t="841940" d="5509">are rejected. He exists in suffering. He calls out God</p>
<p t="848359" d="2000">and challenges the being he created.</p>
<p t="851359" d="5270">God refuses his plea. He tells Cain that his trouble is self-induced.</p>
<p t="857960" d="8660">Cain, in his rage, kills Abel, God&#39;s favorite and truth be known, Cain&#39;s idol.</p>
<p t="867500" d="7040">Cain is jealous, of course, of a successful brother, but he destroys Abel primarily to spite God.</p>
<p t="876199" d="5479">This is the truest version of what happens when people take their vengeance to the ultimate extreme.</p>
<p t="884449" d="4219">Pansram&#39;s response was, and this is what is so terrible,</p>
<p t="889760" d="3260">perfectly understandable. The details of his autobiography</p>
<p t="893180" d="6160">revealed that he was one of Tolstoy&#39;s strong and logically consistent people. He was a powerful,</p>
<p t="899500" d="4720">consistent, fearless actor. He had the courage of his convictions.</p>
<p t="904640" d="6280">How could someone like him be expected to forgive and forget given what had happened to him?</p>
<p t="911360" d="2580">Truly terrible things happen to people,</p>
<p t="914260" d="3200">it&#39;s no wonder they&#39;re out for revenge.</p>
<p t="917960" d="4360">Under such conditions vengeance seems a moral necessity.</p>
<p t="923360" d="3800">How can it be distinguished from the demand for justice after all?</p>
<p t="928360" d="7600">After the experience of terrible atrocity, isn&#39;t forgiveness just cowardice or lack of willpower?</p>
<p t="936920" d="6880">Such questions torment me, but people emerge from terrible pasts to do good and not evil,</p>
<p t="944200" d="3200">although such an accomplishment can seem superhuman.</p>
<p t="948280" d="2160">I&#39;ve met people who managed to do it.</p>
<p t="950440" d="5849">I know a man, a great artist, who emerged from just such a school as the one described by</p>
<p t="956420" d="7369">Panzram, only this man was thrown into it as an innocent five-year-old, fresh from a long stretch in the hospital where he had suffered</p>
<p t="963940" d="2440">measles, mumps and chickenpox</p>
<p t="966640" d="2480">simultaneously.</p>
<p t="969160" d="6300">Incapable of speaking the language of the school, deliberately isolated from his family, abused,</p>
<p t="975760" d="5060">starved and otherwise tormented he emerged an angry broken young man.</p>
<p t="981110" d="5809">He hurt himself badly in the aftermath with drugs and alcohol and other forms of self-destructive behavior.</p>
<p t="986920" d="2280">He detested everyone. God,</p>
<p t="989360" d="3020">himself and blind fate included.</p>
<p t="994550" d="2000">But he put it in to all of that.</p>
<p t="996980" d="2000">He stopped drinking.</p>
<p t="999080" d="1740">He stopped hating,</p>
<p t="1000820" d="2059">although it still emerges in flashes.</p>
<p t="1002880" d="6690">He revitalized the artistic culture of his native tradition and trained young men to continue in his footsteps.</p>
<p t="1009570" d="2650">He produced a 50 foot totem pole</p>
<p t="1012500" d="4080">memorializing the events of his life and a canoe 40 feet long</p>
<p t="1016700" d="4540">from a single log of a kind rarely, if ever, produced now.</p>
<p t="1021820" d="6379">He brought his family together and held a great potlatch with 16 hours of dancing and hundreds of people in attendance</p>
<p t="1028660" d="4640">to express his grief and make peace with the past.</p>
<p t="1034240" d="6860">He decided to be a good person and then he did the impossible things required to live that way.</p>
<p t="1043300" d="4500">I had a client who did not have good parents. Her mother died when she was very young.</p>
<p t="1047920" d="6700">Her grandmother who raised her was a harridan, bitter and over-concerned with appearances.</p>
<p t="1055540" d="2420">She mistreated her granddaughter.</p>
<p t="1057960" d="2320">Punishing her for her virtues,</p>
<p t="1060440" d="7820">creativity, sensitivity, intelligence, unable to resist acting out her resentment for an admittedly hard life on</p>
<p t="1068320" d="2120">her granddaughter.</p>
<p t="1071200" d="7120">She had a better relationship with her father, but he was an addict who died badly while she cared for him.</p>
<p t="1079480" d="2240">My client had a son.</p>
<p t="1082160" d="3520">She perpetuated none of this with him</p>
<p t="1085900" d="4180">He grew up truthful and independent and hardworking and smart,</p>
<p t="1090160" d="6180">instead of widening the tear in the cultural fabric she inherited and transmitting it, she sewed it up.</p>
<p t="1096960" d="3780">She rejected the sins of her forefathers</p>
<p t="1101100" d="2200">Such things _can_ be done.</p>
<p t="1107280" d="2000">Nietzsche wrote these words:</p>
<p t="1110700" d="4660">&quot;Distress, whether psychic, physical or intellectual</p>
<p t="1115560" d="2680">need not at all produce nihilism.</p>
<p t="1118960" d="4760">That is the radical rejection of value, meaning and desirability.</p>
<p t="1124600" d="5320">Such distress always permits a variety of interpretations.&quot;</p>
<p t="1131420" d="2900">What Nietzsche meant was this,</p>
<p t="1134640" d="5320">people who experience evil, may certainly desire to perpetuate it, to pay it forward,</p>
<p t="1140770" d="5420">but it is also possible to learn good by experiencing evil.</p>
<p t="1147580" d="2320">A bullied boy can mimic his tormentors,</p>
<p t="1149980" d="7200">but he can also learn from his own abuse, that it is wrong to push people around and make their lives miserable.</p>
<p t="1157840" d="9080">Someone tormented by her mother can learn from her terrible experiences, how important it is to be a good parent.</p>
<p t="1167540" d="7340">Many, perhaps even most, of the adults who abuse children, were abused themselves as children.</p>
<p t="1175540" d="3440">However, the majority of people who were abused as children</p>
<p t="1179160" d="4700">_do not_ abuse their own children. This is a well-established fact,</p>
<p t="1184040" d="2740">which can be demonstrated simply</p>
<p t="1186860" d="3280">arithmetically in this way: if one parent</p>
<p t="1190200" d="7780">abused three children and each of those children had three children and so on, then there would be three abusers in the first</p>
<p t="1198000" d="1100">generation, nine</p>
<p t="1199100" d="5180">in the second, twenty seven the third, eighty-one, the fourth and so on</p>
<p t="1204280" d="3500">exponentially. After twenty generations,</p>
<p t="1207900" d="4660">more than ten billion would have suffered childhood abuse.</p>
<p t="1212920" d="7400">More people than currently inhabit the planet, but instead, abuse disappears across generations.</p>
<p t="1220480" d="2060">People constrain its spread.</p>
<p t="1224200" d="5580">That&#39;s a testament to the genuine dominance of good over evil in the human heart.</p>
<p t="1231180" d="7040">The desire for vengeance, however justified, also bars the way to other productive thoughts.</p>
<p t="1238980" d="3680">The American English poet T.S. Eliot explained</p>
<p t="1242660" d="7040">why in his play, the cocktail party, one of his characters is not having a good time of it.</p>
<p t="1249840" d="7320">She speaks of her profound unhappiness to a psychiatrist. She says she hopes all her suffering is her own fault.</p>
<p t="1257620" d="4740">The psychiatrist is taken aback, he asks why?</p>
<p t="1263680" d="4640">She has thought long and hard about this, she says, and has come to the following conclusion;</p>
<p t="1268800" d="2000">if it&#39;s her fault</p>
<p t="1271120" d="7580">she might be able to do something about it. If it&#39;s God&#39;s fault however, if reality itself is flawed,</p>
<p t="1278920" d="2560">hell-bent on ensuring her misery</p>
<p t="1281900" d="2100">then she is doomed.</p>
<p t="1284940" d="3540">She couldn&#39;t change the structure of reality itself,</p>
<p t="1289300" d="2760">but maybe she could change her own life.</p>
<p t="1295200" d="2740">Alexander Solzhenitsyn,</p>
<p t="1298240" d="4820">the great Russian documenter of the abuses of Stalinism,</p>
<p t="1303360" d="4580">had every reason to question the structure of existence when he was imprisoned</p>
<p t="1308110" d="4819">in a Soviet labor camp in the middle of the terrible 20th century.</p>
<p t="1313020" d="6400">He had served as a soldier on the ill-prepared Russian frontlines in the face of a Nazi invasion.</p>
<p t="1319620" d="5020">He had been arrested, beaten and thrown into prison by his own people.</p>
<p t="1324900" d="2500">Then he was struck by cancer.</p>
<p t="1328520" d="4360">He could have become resentful and bitter, his life had been rendered</p>
<p t="1333080" d="7800">miserable by both Stalin and Hitler, two of the worst tyrants in history. He lived in brutal conditions,</p>
<p t="1341080" d="5700">vast stretches of his precious time were stolen from him and squandered.</p>
<p t="1347080" d="5660">He witnessed the pointless and degrading suffering and death of his friends and acquaintances,</p>
<p t="1353080" d="4220">then he contracted an extremely serious disease.</p>
<p t="1357780" d="3280">Solzhenitsyn had cause to curse God,</p>
<p t="1361440" d="1540">Jobe himself</p>
<p t="1362980" d="2000">barely had it as hard.</p>
<p t="1366420" d="3020">But the great writer, the profound</p>
<p t="1369520" d="6560">spirited defender of truth, did not allow his mind to turn towards vengeance and destruction.</p>
<p t="1376240" d="6500">He opened his eyes instead. During his many trials Solzhenitsyn, encountered people who comported themselves</p>
<p t="1382740" d="3040">nobly under horrific circumstances.</p>
<p t="1386200" d="7660">He contemplated their behavior deeply. Then, he asked himself the most difficult of questions,</p>
<p t="1395260" d="4160">had he personally contributed to the catastrophe of his life?</p>
<p t="1399420" d="1940">If so,</p>
<p t="1401720" d="2040">how?</p>
<p t="1404440" d="5040">He remembered his unquestioning support of the communist party in his early years.</p>
<p t="1409880" d="2060">He reconsidered his whole life,</p>
<p t="1411940" d="2800">he had plenty of time in the camps.</p>
<p t="1416280" d="2500">How had he missed the mark in the past?</p>
<p t="1419020" d="5960">How many times had he acted against his own conscience, engaging in actions that he knew to be wrong?</p>
<p t="1425980" d="3420">How many times had he betrayed himself and lied?</p>
<p t="1429900" d="3240">Was there any way that the sins of his past could be</p>
<p t="1433320" d="6100">rectified, atoned for, in the muddy hell of a Soviet gulag?</p>
<p t="1441780" d="3640">Solzhenitsyn pored over the details of his life with a fine-tooth comb,</p>
<p t="1445900" d="6040">he asked himself a second question and a third, can I stop making such mistakes now?</p>
<p t="1452020" d="4540">Can I repair the damage done by my past failures now?</p>
<p t="1457720" d="7540">He learned to watch and to listen. He found people he admired who were honest despite everything.</p>
<p t="1465580" d="2420">He took himself apart piece-by-piece,</p>
<p t="1468040" d="6980">let what was unnecessary and harmful die and resurrected himself. Then he wrote the Gulag Archipelago,</p>
<p t="1475020" d="7240">a history of the soviet prison camp system. It&#39;s a forceful terrible book</p>
<p t="1482440" d="6860">written with the overwhelming moral force of unvarnished truth. Its sheer outrage screamed</p>
<p t="1489400" d="2560">unbearably across hundreds of pages,</p>
<p t="1492400" d="6500">banned and for good reason in the USSR. It was smuggled to the west in</p>
<p t="1499080" d="2820">the 1970s and burst upon the world.</p>
<p t="1502500" d="2640">Solzhenitsyn&#39;s writing utterly and</p>
<p t="1505300" d="5420">finally demolished the intellectual credibility of communism as ideology or</p>
<p t="1510800" d="1580">society.</p>
<p t="1512380" d="2359">He took an axe to the trunk of the tree,</p>
<p t="1515100" d="7380">whose bitter fruits had nourished him so poorly and whose planting he had witnessed and supported.</p>
<p t="1524440" d="6520">One man&#39;s decision to change his life instead of cursing fate shook the whole</p>
<p t="1531160" d="3780">pathological system of communist tyranny to its core.</p>
<p t="1535600" d="3780">It crumbled entirely not so many years later and</p>
<p t="1539560" d="4760">Solzhenitsyn&#39;s courage was not the least of the reasons why.</p>
<p t="1545700" d="7120">He was not the only such person to perform such a miracle, Václav Havel, the persecuted writer who later</p>
<p t="1552900" d="2960">impossibly became the president of</p>
<p t="1555900" d="6560">Czechoslovakia, then of the new Czech Republic comes to mind as does Mahatma Ghandi.</p>
<p t="1564540" d="2600">Things fall apart.</p>
<p t="1568500" d="8020">Whole peoples have adamantly refused to judge reality, to criticize being, to blame God.</p>
<p t="1576640" d="7120">It&#39;s interesting to consider the Old Testament Hebrews in this regard, their travails followed a consistent pattern.</p>
<p t="1583920" d="5960">The stories of Adam and Eve and Cain and Abel and Noah and the Tower of Babel are truly ancient,</p>
<p t="1589900" d="3440">their origins vanish into the mysteries of time.</p>
<p t="1593920" d="6560">It&#39;s not until after the flood story in Genesis, that something like history as we understand it, truly starts.</p>
<p t="1600660" d="2000">It starts with Abraham.</p>
<p t="1603000" d="6520">Abraham&#39;s descendants become the Hebrew people of the Old Testament, also known as the Hebrew Bible.</p>
<p t="1609780" d="2760">They enter a covenant with Yahwah,</p>
<p t="1612720" d="4700">with God, and began their recognizably historical adventures.</p>
<p t="1617640" d="6660">Under the leadership of a great man, the Hebrews organized themselves into a society and then an empire.</p>
<p t="1624480" d="2140">As their fortunes rise,</p>
<p t="1626640" d="5420">success breeds pride and arrogance. Corruption raises its ugly head.</p>
<p t="1632300" d="4800">The increasingly hubristic state becomes obsessed with power.</p>
<p t="1637280" d="5520">Begins to forget its duty to the widows and the orphans and deviates from its age-old</p>
<p t="1642920" d="1920">agreement with God.</p>
<p t="1644850" d="1800">A prophet arises</p>
<p t="1646650" d="7640">He brazenly and publicly reviles the authoritarian king and faithless country for their failures before God,</p>
<p t="1654500" d="4560">an act of blind courage, telling them of the terrible judgment to come.</p>
<p t="1660180" d="5960">When his wise words are not completely ignored, they are heeded too late.</p>
<p t="1666900" d="6880">God smites his wayward people dooming them to abject defeat in battle and generations of subjugation.</p>
<p t="1674240" d="2500">The Hebrews repent at length,</p>
<p t="1676940" d="5100">blaming their misfortune on their own failure to adhere to God&#39;s word.</p>
<p t="1682320" d="3740">They insisted themselves, that they could have done better.</p>
<p t="1686600" d="3340">They rebuild their state and the cycle begins again.</p>
<p t="1690600" d="2000">This is life.</p>
<p t="1693240" d="4680">We build structures to live in, we build families and states and countries.</p>
<p t="1697920" d="7060">We abstract the principles upon, which those structures are founded and formulate systems of belief.</p>
<p t="1705360" d="5380">At first, we inhabit those structures and beliefs like Adam and Eve in Paradise.</p>
<p t="1710900" d="6380">But success makes us complacent, we forget to pay attention. We take what we have for granted.</p>
<p t="1717280" d="6780">We turn a blind eye. We fail to notice that things are changing or that corruption is taking root</p>
<p t="1724240" d="2260">and everything falls apart.</p>
<p t="1726500" d="3860">Is that the fault of reality? Or God?</p>
<p t="1730520" d="5760">Or do things fall apart because we have not paid sufficient attention?</p>
<p t="1736820" d="7560">When the hurricane hit New Orleans and the town sank under the waves, was that a natural disaster?</p>
<p t="1745280" d="5680">The Dutch prepare their dikes for the worst storm in 10,000 years.</p>
<p t="1751940" d="4600">Had New Orleans followed that example, no tragedy would have occurred.</p>
<p t="1756860" d="4160">It&#39;s not that no one knew. The Flood Control Act of 1965</p>
<p t="1761100" d="6700">mandated improvements in the levee system that held back Lake Pontchartrain.</p>
<p t="1769880" d="8620">The system was to be completed by 1978. 40 years later only 60 percent of the work had been done</p>
<p t="1779480" d="5000">Willful blindness and corruption took the city down.</p>
<p t="1785640" d="6520">A Hurricane is an act of God. But failure to prepare when the necessity for preparation is well-known,</p>
<p t="1792240" d="7020">that&#39;s sin. That&#39;s failure to hit the mark and the wages of sin is  death.</p>
<p t="1799460" d="740">Romans</p>
<p t="1800208" d="1512">6:23</p>
<p t="1801720" d="3619">The ancient Jews always blamed themselves when things fell apart.</p>
<p t="1805340" d="4800">They acted as if God&#39;s goodness, the goodness of reality, was</p>
<p t="1810220" d="3820">axiomatic and took responsibility for their own failure.</p>
<p t="1814460" d="1120">That&#39;s insanely</p>
<p t="1815580" d="1060">responsible.</p>
<p t="1816640" d="7780">But the alternative is to judge reality as insufficient, to criticize being itself and to sink</p>
<p t="1824420" d="4920">into resentment and the desire for revenge. If you are suffering,</p>
<p t="1829560" d="1440">well,</p>
<p t="1831000" d="5180">that&#39;s the norm. People are limited and life is tragic.</p>
<p t="1836940" d="4820">If your suffering is unbearable however, and you are starting to become corrupted,</p>
<p t="1842460" d="2000">here&#39;s something to think about:</p>
<p t="1846330" d="1557">Clean up your life.</p>
<p t="1847887" d="2833">Consider your circumstances.</p>
<p t="1851540" d="2000">Start small.</p>
<p t="1854220" d="3820">Have you taken full advantage of the opportunities offered to you?</p>
<p t="1858800" d="8640">Are you working hard on your career or even your job? Or are you letting bitterness and resentment hold you back and drag you down?</p>
<p t="1868420" d="3040">Have you made peace with your brother?</p>
<p t="1872680" d="5780">Are you treating your spouse and your children with dignity and respect?</p>
<p t="1879740" d="3900">Do you have habits that are destroying your health and well-being?</p>
<p t="1884420" d="3240">Are you truly shouldering your responsibilities?</p>
<p t="1887760" d="5000">Have you said what you need to say to your friends and family members?</p>
<p t="1893180" d="6500">Are there things that you could do, that you know you could do, that would make things around you better?</p>
<p t="1900380" d="2000">Have you cleaned up your life?</p>
<p t="1904320" d="2220">If the answer is no,</p>
<p t="1906880" d="2280">here&#39;s something to try:</p>
<p t="1909640" d="5040">Start to stop doing what you know to be wrong!</p>
<p t="1915060" d="1890">Start stopping today!</p>
<p t="1916950" d="5670">Don&#39;t waste time questioning, how you know that what you&#39;re doing is wrong, if you&#39;re certain that it is.</p>
<p t="1922800" d="6000">Inopportune questioning can confuse without enlightening, as well as deflecting you from action.</p>
<p t="1929100" d="7800">You can know that something is wrong or right without knowing why, your entire being can tell you something that you can neither explain nor</p>
<p t="1936940" d="1400">articulate.</p>
<p t="1938340" d="7320">Every person is too complex to know themselves completely and we all contain wisdom that we cannot comprehend.</p>
<p t="1946280" d="1600">So,</p>
<p t="1947880" d="5480">simply stop, when you apprehend however dimly that you should stop.</p>
<p t="1954140" d="2320">Stop acting in that particular</p>
<p t="1956480" d="5140">despicable manner. Stop saying those things that make you weak and ashamed.</p>
<p t="1961620" d="7300">Say only those things that make you strong. Do only those things that you could speak of with honor.</p>
<p t="1969800" d="4340">You can use your own standards of judgment, you can rely on yourself for guidance.</p>
<p t="1974140" d="4340">You don&#39;t have to adhere to some external arbitrary code of behavior,</p>
<p t="1978500" d="5540">although, you should not overlook the guidance of your culture. Life is short</p>
<p t="1984100" d="2800">and you don&#39;t have time to figure out everything on your own.</p>
<p t="1987060" d="7360">The wisdom of the past was hard-earned and your dead ancestors may have something useful to tell you.</p>
<p t="1995720" d="1960">Don&#39;t blame capitalism,</p>
<p t="1997680" d="4560">the radical left or the iniquity of your enemies.</p>
<p t="2002620" d="6380">Don&#39;t reorganize the state until you have ordered your own experience. Have some humility!</p>
<p t="2009640" d="6700">If you cannot bring peace to your household, how dare you try to rule a city?</p>
<p t="2017540" d="5740">Let your own soul guide you, watch what happens over the days and weeks.</p>
<p t="2024200" d="4700">When you are at work you will begin to say, what you really think.</p>
<p t="2029620" d="6580">You will start to tell your wife, or your husband or your children or your parents what you really want and need.</p>
<p t="2037040" d="5600">When you know that you have left something undone, you will act to correct the omission.</p>
<p t="2042820" d="7200">Your head will start to clear up as you stop filling it with lies. Your experience will improve as you stop</p>
<p t="2050040" d="3080">distorting it with inauthentic actions.</p>
<p t="2054320" d="8600">You will then begin to discover new, more subtle things, that you are doing wrong. Stop doing those too.</p>
<p t="2064060" d="5840">After some months and years of diligent effort your life will become simpler and less complicated.</p>
<p t="2070420" d="7060">Your judgment will improve. You will untangle your past, you will become stronger and less bitter,</p>
<p t="2078020" d="3440">you will move more confidently into the future.</p>
<p t="2081880" d="2280">You will stop making your life</p>
<p t="2084160" d="2000">unnecessarily difficult.</p>
<p t="2086920" d="4260">You will then be left with the inevitable bare tragedies of life,</p>
<p t="2091480" d="5220">but they will no longer be compounded with bitterness and deceit.</p>
<p t="2099200" d="2880">Perhaps you will discover that your now less corrupted</p>
<p t="2102080" d="6620">soul, much stronger than it might otherwise have been, is now able to bear those remaining</p>
<p t="2108860" d="2420">necessary, minimal,</p>
<p t="2111320" d="2080">inescapable tragedies.</p>
<p t="2113960" d="4360">Perhaps you will even learn to encounter them so that they stay tragic,</p>
<p t="2118480" d="2680">merely tragic, instead of</p>
<p t="2121200" d="2880">degenerating into outright hellishness.</p>
<p t="2125140" d="6220">Maybe your anxiety and hopelessness and resentment and anger, however murderous initially,</p>
<p t="2131740" d="1560">will recede.</p>
<p t="2133300" d="7280">Perhaps your un-corrupted soul will then see its existence as a genuine good, as something to celebrate</p>
<p t="2140740" d="3280">even in the face of your own vulnerability.</p>
<p t="2145280" d="7020">Perhaps you will become an ever more powerful force for peace and whatever is good.</p>
<p t="2153620" d="7300">Perhaps you will then see that if all people did this in their own lives the world might stop being an evil place.</p>
<p t="2162140" d="6200">After that with continued effort, perhaps it could even stop being a tragic place.</p>
<p t="2169620" d="5940">Who knows what existence might be like, if we all decided to strive for the best.</p>
<p t="2175760" d="8080">Who knows what eternal heavens might be established by our spirits, purified by truth, aiming skyward</p>
<p t="2184020" d="2240">right here on the fallen earth.</p>
<p t="2187260" d="5280">Set your house in perfect order before you criticize the world.</p>
