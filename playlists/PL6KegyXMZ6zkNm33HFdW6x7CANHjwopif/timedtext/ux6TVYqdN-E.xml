<p t="7029" d="11311">So the last time we talked, I talked to you
about how the knowledge structures that we</p>
<p t="18340" d="2590">inhabit might be built from the bottom up.</p>
<p t="20930" d="6720">So I'm showing you this diagram because
it might clarify that a little bit.</p>
<p t="27650" d="7069">What you see at the top - this is a hierarchy,
a partially built hierarchy and so one way</p>
<p t="34719" d="5410">of thinking of an attribute like good when
you apply it to a person, or bad or evil or</p>
<p t="40129" d="4441">wonderful, one way to think about it is as
a description of an object, but it's not</p>
<p t="44570" d="1000">really.</p>
<p t="45570" d="5550">It's shorthand for a set of - well I think
of them as micro personalities, but you can</p>
<p t="51120" d="3200">also think about them as behavioral patterns.</p>
<p t="54320" d="5179">Now, one of the things I mentioned to you
about - I talked to you a little bit about</p>
<p t="59499" d="6421">words at one point, and what words signify
and this is a very complicated problem so</p>
<p t="65920" d="5220">most of you are probably Augustinians without
even knowing it because St. Augustine originally</p>
<p t="71140" d="3010">proposed that a word was a label for a thing.</p>
<p t="74150" d="3120">Of course, that's how people naturally think.</p>
<p t="77270" d="7349">I'm sure most of you would regard that definition
as perfectly suitable, but it's by no means</p>
<p t="84619" d="6131">the only definition and it's by no means
necessarily the correct definition.</p>
<p t="90750" d="4000">There's a famous philosopher named Wittgenstein
who proposed instead that a word was like</p>
<p t="94750" d="6869">a piece in a chess game which meant that it
was something that you did something with,</p>
<p t="101619" d="2070">or you might think about it actually as a
tool.</p>
<p t="103689" d="4351">And when you think about how you use words,
you can see that you're using them often as</p>
<p t="108040" d="9280">tools to interact with other people for a
purpose.</p>
<p t="117320" d="6350">What I like about the tool idea - the tool
idea is a very evolutionary sophisticated</p>
<p t="123670" d="7309">concept, partly because we're tool using
creatures probably beyond our other capacities</p>
<p t="130979" d="6111">except for possibly imitation and language
which set us so far apart from other animals,</p>
<p t="137090" d="5330">but the thing about a tool is that the difference
between a tool and an object doesn't have</p>
<p t="142420" d="1000">a user.</p>
<p t="143420" d="5380">The word object doesn't imply user, but the
word tool implies user, and it's not obvious</p>
<p t="148800" d="3631">that we ever interact with anything in the
world without interacting with it in some</p>
<p t="152431" d="1679">motivated way.</p>
<p t="154110" d="3439">And so, what we're doing is we're using
words to get through the world.</p>
<p t="157549" d="4461">To interact properly within the world and
to move where we want to go.</p>
<p t="162010" d="2190">So that's the second way of thinking about
a word.</p>
<p t="164200" d="2590">Here's another way of thinking about a word.</p>
<p t="166790" d="5880">A word is like a box of things and so imagine
that you cleaned out your basement and there's</p>
<p t="172670" d="4080">a bunch of boxes downstairs and one box is
labeled books.</p>
<p t="176750" d="4190">Well inside that box, there could be any manner
of books.</p>
<p t="180940" d="6049">Books is a very very diverse set of phenomena.</p>
<p t="186989" d="4500">If you're moving, books are kind of condensed
into one thing which are kind of heavy objects</p>
<p t="191489" d="3201">made out of paper.</p>
<p t="194690" d="2920">You can also imagine another box that says
things.</p>
<p t="197610" d="3909">And in the thing box, I'm sure you have
a thing drawer at home where you put all the</p>
<p t="201519" d="4451">things you don't know what to do with so it's
like the category of all things you don't</p>
<p t="205970" d="1570">know what to do with.</p>
<p t="207540" d="1000">Things.</p>
<p t="208540" d="8380">Okay so a word can also represent a relatively
heterogenous set of tools or entities.</p>
<p t="216920" d="6489">That's very very very useful to know because
one of the things that happens often when</p>
<p t="223409" d="4940">people are arguing is that they use the same
word but each word contains a set of different</p>
<p t="228349" d="1170">objects.</p>
<p t="229519" d="5420">You might say for example, is fear real?</p>
<p t="234939" d="1660">Questions like that are very strange.</p>
<p t="236599" d="3700">They're not really answerable in some sense
because it depends on exactly what you mean</p>
<p t="240299" d="5661">by fear because fear can contain a lot of
heterogenous entities, roughly speaking, and</p>
<p t="245960" d="3699">it means - it also depends on what you mean
by real.</p>
<p t="249659" d="4071">So you can define fear and you can define
real and so that fear is a subcategory of</p>
<p t="253730" d="5390">real or you can define fear and you can define
fear so that fear isn't a subset of real.</p>
<p t="259120" d="7100">So, the idea that fear is a box that only
contains a certain set of entities or a certain</p>
<p t="266220" d="4880">set of tools and that reality is the same
is wrong, and people argue about those sorts</p>
<p t="271100" d="3580">of things all the time, and they make these
binary questions.</p>
<p t="274680" d="1299">Is X a Y?</p>
<p t="275979" d="5631">Well, X and Y are generally not well enough
to find so that you can easily find an answer</p>
<p t="281610" d="1820">to a binary question like that.</p>
<p t="283430" d="5820">Okay so, words can also represent a relatively
heterogenous set of attributes or objects</p>
<p t="289250" d="1120">or tools.</p>
<p t="290370" d="4760">When you say that someone's a good person
for example, you don't mean they're a</p>
<p t="295130" d="6220">good person all the time or that everything
they've ever done is good because they wouldn't</p>
<p t="301350" d="4710">be a good person then, they would be a saint
or some other fictional character like that.</p>
<p t="306060" d="5350">So, when you're applying the label - we'll
call it label for the purposes of this argument.</p>
<p t="311410" d="2610">It's a descriptive tool actually.</p>
<p t="314020" d="4850">When you're applying a term like that to
someone, it's a shorthand for a variety</p>
<p t="318870" d="2829">of states that this person could exist in.</p>
<p t="321699" d="3211">The majority of which you regard as positive.</p>
<p t="324910" d="4060">You might say he's a better person than
she is, and then you'd say well the proportion</p>
<p t="328970" d="6640">of attributes that she has - I think I said
she, whatever - it exceeds the proportion</p>
<p t="335610" d="2750">of positives that this other person has.</p>
<p t="338360" d="3880">So the other way you can think about a word
is - this is more complicated, it involves</p>
<p t="342240" d="1260">a little bit of visualization.</p>
<p t="343500" d="3310">So imagine you have a child's train on a
track.</p>
<p t="346810" d="1940">It's going around and around the track.</p>
<p t="348750" d="4440">And it's got cars on it that you can put
things in, and all the cars are full of things,</p>
<p t="353190" d="5280">and then on the track there's a box with
cutouts in it so that the train can pass through,</p>
<p t="358470" d="2690">and on top of the box is a word.</p>
<p t="361160" d="3930">And the word is things, and the train is going
through the box.</p>
<p t="365090" d="4830">In some sense, what that would mean - imagine
the train is long enough - at any given second,</p>
<p t="369920" d="4399">the box of things would contain different
things, but it would still be a box of things.</p>
<p t="374319" d="2570">And a lot of words we use are like that.</p>
<p t="376889" d="7370">Not only do they represent a heterogenous
set of entities, but the set changes depending</p>
<p t="384259" d="3481">on the context that we use the word in.</p>
<p t="387740" d="4780">So the reason I'm telling you that is because
a word, here's another way of thinking about</p>
<p t="392520" d="1000">a word.</p>
<p t="393520" d="6100">This will be good for you computer - well
you're all computer people now of course.</p>
<p t="399620" d="4090">A word is a low resolution image.</p>
<p t="403710" d="3570">So you think about it.</p>
<p t="407280" d="3590">A word is a good enough approximation of the
thing that it's representing.</p>
<p t="410870" d="1180">Sort of like a thumbnail.</p>
<p t="412050" d="4810">Now obviously one of the differences of a
thumbnail and the real thing is that the real</p>
<p t="416860" d="5050">thing exists at a much more, much higher level
of resolution.</p>
<p t="421910" d="1960">It exists at many, many more layers.</p>
<p t="423870" d="2290">You can use the thumbnail to represent it.</p>
<p t="426160" d="5390">The advantage to doing that is that it doesn't
take up much processing time, and it doesn't</p>
<p t="431550" d="1130">take up much memory.</p>
<p t="432680" d="3840">So lots of time, you want to use the shorthand
for the thing rather than the thing because</p>
<p t="436520" d="2100">it's just too complicated otherwise.</p>
<p t="438620" d="6389">And then you might say well how do you know
your shorthand representation is a good representation</p>
<p t="445009" d="4572">of the thing you're trying to represent, and
the pragmatists would say well it depends</p>
<p t="449581" d="1838">on what you want to do with it.</p>
<p t="451419" d="1631">That's the tool-like aspect.</p>
<p t="453050" d="7310">It's like if you're using word X to represent
potentially heterogeneous class Y, and when</p>
<p t="460360" d="3739">you use it, you get to where you're want or
you get close enough to where you want, then</p>
<p t="464099" d="1540">it's good enough.</p>
<p t="465639" d="4090">So it's like how you know a joke is good
enough, well someone laughs.</p>
<p t="469729" d="5590">Okay, the joke is good enough, and so one
of the things that's quite interesting about</p>
<p t="475319" d="3901">the way you interact with the world, and this
is something the pragmatists really discovered</p>
<p t="479220" d="6009">in some sense, was that you're always aiming
at some bounded set of events that's somewhat</p>
<p t="485229" d="4261">different than the current set of events because
otherwise you could just sit there, and then</p>
<p t="489490" d="5049">you put your conceptions to work and your
actions to work to manage the transformation,</p>
<p t="494539" d="4491">and if you manage the transformation, then
it's good enough.</p>
<p t="499030" d="2460">You don't have to go any farther than that.</p>
<p t="501490" d="4870">So that explains partly how you can maneuver
in the world with limited knowledge.</p>
<p t="506360" d="7140">You use low resolution representations to
partially hit vague goals, and that generally</p>
<p t="513500" d="1000">gets you there.</p>
<p t="514500" d="6770">That process was called satisficing by - now
what's his name, an extraordinarily famous</p>
<p t="521270" d="2330">economist and psychologist.</p>
<p t="523600" d="2080">Anyone remember who coined the word satisficing?</p>
<p t="525680" d="3130">Well, an economist psychologist would be Herb
Simon.</p>
<p t="528810" d="1570">That's right, it's Simon.</p>
<p t="530380" d="4590">It was Herb Simon, and you know he said well,
you're often not out to optimize.</p>
<p t="534970" d="4420">Let's say in a search for a partner, to
optimize it you'd have to search through</p>
<p t="539390" d="1330">several billion people.</p>
<p t="540720" d="3450">Well you're not gonna do that because you
don't have the time.</p>
<p t="544170" d="4371">So then you might say well, you don't know
exactly how to do it but it's something</p>
<p t="548541" d="1429">this.</p>
<p t="549970" d="3410">You have five attributes that you're looking
for and maybe two that you don't know you're</p>
<p t="553380" d="4030">looking for but you are looking for, and the
first person that comes along that matches</p>
<p t="557410" d="2610">those well enough, you pick.</p>
<p t="560020" d="5640">So it's not an optimization issue, but given
that you have a limited amount of time, you</p>
<p t="565660" d="1670">can't wait around for optimized solutions.</p>
<p t="567330" d="5870">You have to go ahead with sufficient, and
then move to the next issue.</p>
<p t="573200" d="8190">Okay, so all that's a conceptual precursor
for taking a look at this diagram.</p>
<p t="581390" d="1950">So we're calling someone a good person.</p>
<p t="583340" d="1000">So what does it mean?</p>
<p t="584340" d="1590">Well we're going to do a bit of a microanalysis.</p>
<p t="585930" d="3650">We're going to assume it's a bit of a
shorthand, low resolution representation of</p>
<p t="589580" d="3050">the person and that you can decompose it.</p>
<p t="592630" d="4680">If someone says X is a - Henry is a good person,
and maybe he's 45.</p>
<p t="597310" d="2110">You might say does he have children?</p>
<p t="599420" d="1010">Then you might say yes.</p>
<p t="600430" d="3090">Then you might say well is he a good parent
because you might assume that if he's a</p>
<p t="603520" d="2170">good person, he might be a good parent.</p>
<p t="605690" d="4340">Now it's conceivable that he can be a good
parent without being a good parent if he was</p>
<p t="610030" d="2600">good at five other important things.</p>
<p t="612630" d="3810">But let's assume as a good person he's
also a good parent.</p>
<p t="616440" d="4690">I think it's reasonable to assume that good
parent would be a subset of good person, right,</p>
<p t="621130" d="2000">because it's more specific.</p>
<p t="623130" d="5790">More specific means it covers less time and
space in some sense because good person is</p>
<p t="628920" d="4220">a description of a person that covers how
the person interacts with the world across</p>
<p t="633140" d="3620">the broadest possible amount of time and location.</p>
<p t="636760" d="4440">And then good parent, well you can find that
out when they're interacting with children</p>
<p t="641200" d="1650">let's say for the sake of argument.</p>
<p t="642850" d="3900">There's other issues, and then you might
say well if he's a good parent what does</p>
<p t="646750" d="2910">he have to do to be a good parent?</p>
<p t="649660" d="4010">Well he has to feed his children so he probably
needs a job, and it would be better if it</p>
<p t="653670" d="1000">was a good job.</p>
<p t="654670" d="3890">So he's got a good job and that's part
of being a good person.</p>
<p t="658560" d="7250">And then maybe he can care for his family
and so care might be regarded as a more specific</p>
<p t="665810" d="6170">subset of good parent, and so you can decompose
caring to, let's say, play with baby, and</p>
<p t="671980" d="5960">then you can decompose play into - well I
decomposed it into peek, tickle, and clean.</p>
<p t="677940" d="4510">What's interesting about this is those are
all abstractions, but once you get down to</p>
<p t="682450" d="4230">a high enough level of resolution, they're
no longer abstractions in that they're actually</p>
<p t="686680" d="2010">actions you undertake in the world.</p>
<p t="688690" d="2640">Moving your hand is not an abstraction.</p>
<p t="691330" d="4420">So at some point - and this is a nice elegant
solution to the mind body problem to some</p>
<p t="695750" d="1000">degree.</p>
<p t="696750" d="5180">At some level of resolution - high resolution
- it stops being conceptual and starts being</p>
<p t="701930" d="3320">action, and that's where the mind hits the
world.</p>
<p t="705250" d="4940">If you go into an even higher level of resolution
than that, like what do you have to do to</p>
<p t="710190" d="1160">move your hand?</p>
<p t="711350" d="2380">The answer to that is you don't know.</p>
<p t="713730" d="1010">You just do it.</p>
<p t="714740" d="5060">And so your consciousness bottoms out, in
some sense, at the level of motor activity.</p>
<p t="719800" d="4620">So there's a level above which you can't
perceive which are the networks that you're</p>
<p t="724420" d="5980">involved in and there's a level below which
you can't perceive, which is under normal</p>
<p t="730400" d="5750">circumstances, procedural control which is
whatever enables you to actually move.</p>
<p t="736150" d="4980">So then you might say well what are all of
these things.</p>
<p t="741130" d="3000">How would you conceptualize a decomposed good
person.</p>
<p t="744130" d="3270">Well then you might say well what are all
these things made out of?</p>
<p t="747400" d="2150">In a sense, what are their constituent elements?</p>
<p t="749550" d="3500">Good person, good parent, family care, play
with baby.</p>
<p t="753050" d="1190">They're sort of like games.</p>
<p t="754240" d="1130">They're sort of like stories.</p>
<p t="755370" d="1800">They're sort of like rituals.</p>
<p t="757170" d="6200">I think about them in these terms, so if you
look at - that's where we get to this particular</p>
<p t="763370" d="4390">diagram which we're gonna concentrate on
quite a bit.</p>
<p t="767760" d="23370">Let me shift to it and we'll talk about
that.</p>
<p t="791130" d="16910">Now I don't exactly know how to - what to
call this thing.</p>
<p t="808040" d="6130">I think the best way of thinking about it
is it's a subpersonality and that the reason</p>
<p t="814170" d="3900">I call it a subpersonality is because only
a personality has all the attributes that</p>
<p t="818070" d="2890">this thing has and so the attributes are.</p>
<p t="820960" d="4720">I talked to you last week about the fact that
the Russian neuropsychologist for example</p>
<p t="825680" d="4870">felt that people had to build models of the
world and so you can call this a model of</p>
<p t="830550" d="2270">the world.</p>
<p t="832820" d="5420">So the reason they suspected that was because
if you brought someone - I think I ran through</p>
<p t="838240" d="3950">this - if you bring someone into a laboratory
and you play them a tone, when they first</p>
<p t="842190" d="5330">hear the tone they manifest an orienting reflex
which is a change in skin conduction, and</p>
<p t="847520" d="2980">that's actually a consequence of neurological
activity.</p>
<p t="850500" d="3790">And then if you play the tone a bunch, they
stop having the reaction and then if you vary</p>
<p t="854290" d="8840">the tone on any perceptible dimension, the
orienting reflex returns, and so the inference</p>
<p t="863130" d="8260">from that is obviously the person must be
constructing a model of the tone because otherwise</p>
<p t="871390" d="4230">how would they know if something deviated
from it, especially on all those dimensions.</p>
<p t="875620" d="5160">So not only is it a model, it's a multi-dimensional
model.</p>
<p t="880780" d="5110">Okay, now the upshot of that is for a long
time, people tried to figure out how in the</p>
<p t="885890" d="3860">world we model the world, and then they tried
to figure out how to make smart machines that</p>
<p t="889750" d="4910">modeled the world that could then plan their
actions in the modeled world and then could</p>
<p t="894660" d="1630">act in the world as a consequence.</p>
<p t="896290" d="4640">They got nowhere with that because it turned
out that the world is so damn complex that</p>
<p t="900930" d="3090">if you're gonna model it, you're gonna
spend all the time modeling.</p>
<p t="904020" d="3220">You're not gonna spend your time acting
in it and you're not gonna get anywhere.</p>
<p t="907240" d="4690">It's partly because the world is almost
infinitely complex, and so if you're trying</p>
<p t="911930" d="4130">to get a computer to look at the world, you
might say well what is the computer supposed</p>
<p t="916060" d="1180">to look at?</p>
<p t="917240" d="1000">Everything.</p>
<p t="918240" d="1510">Well, no.</p>
<p t="919750" d="6160">I mean, you look at a lot in some ways, and
not very much in others, and half your brain</p>
<p t="925910" d="2930">is dedicated, roughly speaking, to visual
processing.</p>
<p t="928840" d="3420">Then you've got your other senses to help
you figure out what's going on.</p>
<p t="932260" d="2280">But you don't build a model of the whole
world.</p>
<p t="934540" d="3000">You don't build any model at all of the
parts of the world that aren't relevant</p>
<p t="937540" d="1020">to you.</p>
<p t="938560" d="4000">For example, your model of this floor is very
low resolution.</p>
<p t="942560" d="4710">If I took you guys out in the hallway, assuming
the hallway floor isn't the same color and</p>
<p t="947270" d="2180">I said, what was the color of this floor.</p>
<p t="949450" d="3170">You would not be able to tell me, and the
reason for that is who cares.</p>
<p t="952620" d="4640">It could be shifting color all the time while
you're sitting here, you know, subtly, and</p>
<p t="957260" d="1000">you're not gonna care.</p>
<p t="958260" d="3410">The reason for that is you're not falling
through it, and it isn't moving.</p>
<p t="961670" d="4260">So it's like an invisible presupposition
of your current knowledge structure.</p>
<p t="965930" d="2970">And there's all sorts of things going on around
you that are like that.</p>
<p t="968900" d="1760">You don't pay attention to the walls.</p>
<p t="970660" d="3000">You really don't pay attention to the people
that are around you.</p>
<p t="973660" d="2550">They could sort themselves in a different
way.</p>
<p t="976210" d="2320">You wouldn't notice unless you know the person.</p>
<p t="978530" d="2990">There's also all sorts of things that you
don't model.</p>
<p t="981520" d="3940">Now you've all seen the invisible gorilla
video, I presume.</p>
<p t="985460" d="1460">Everyone's seen that.</p>
<p t="986920" d="3550">Is there anyone here who hasn't seen that
video.</p>
<p t="990470" d="1000">Okay good.</p>
<p t="991470" d="1000">So that's something eh.</p>
<p t="992470" d="3230">It's really something that there's a psychology
experiment that's so well known you can talk</p>
<p t="995700" d="2210">to a crowd now and almost everyone's seen
it.</p>
<p t="997910" d="1050">It's so shocking.</p>
<p t="998960" d="3600">It's like, of course I can see a gorilla
if one was dancing around on a basketball</p>
<p t="1002560" d="1000">court.</p>
<p t="1003560" d="1470">It's like, ha no you wouldn't.</p>
<p t="1005030" d="2380">Or there's a fifty percent chance you wouldn't.</p>
<p t="1007410" d="7080">Now the reason for that is, fundamentally
speaking, is you're given a task when you</p>
<p t="1014490" d="4840">watch that video, and the task is to count
the number of times the ball is thrown by</p>
<p t="1019330" d="2540">the team in black.</p>
<p t="1021870" d="5050">All of a sudden, your perceptual systems reorient
themselves and you're not really looking at</p>
<p t="1026920" d="1000">people.</p>
<p t="1027920" d="5840">You're looking at something that might be
animated stick figures who are engaged, momentarily,</p>
<p t="1033760" d="5260">in moving the object of perceptual importance
around.</p>
<p t="1039020" d="3750">So you can blur them out, which you do because
obviously you can't tell the difference</p>
<p t="1042770" d="3390">between a gorilla and the person dressed in
black.</p>
<p t="1046160" d="2270">The reason you can't is you don't need to.</p>
<p t="1048430" d="6590">In order to fulfill the task, you can treat
all the people like vaguely moving black objects,</p>
<p t="1055020" d="4380">and as long as that doesn't interfere with
your counting, then it's irrelevant.</p>
<p t="1059400" d="3670">So actually, you don't build a model of
the whole world.</p>
<p t="1063070" d="4660">And you build a model of only the parts of
the world that are relevant to your ongoing</p>
<p t="1067730" d="1000">micro action.</p>
<p t="1068730" d="4330">Now the problem that brings up is how do you
know what's relevant.</p>
<p t="1073060" d="2580">Well that's a tough question.</p>
<p t="1075640" d="5370">I would say, the reason you know what's
relevant is because some things don't change</p>
<p t="1081010" d="4640">over time, and you've been evolving through
three and a half billion years.</p>
<p t="1085650" d="2500">So you've built yourself.</p>
<p t="1088150" d="5150">If we go back to that other diagram, you can
imagine the levels there from the micro activities</p>
<p t="1093300" d="2020">to the abstractions.</p>
<p t="1095320" d="4340">You think about how much building had to go
in so you could undertake those microactions.</p>
<p t="1099660" d="1990">So like, here you can move your hand.</p>
<p t="1101650" d="1570">Well that's great.</p>
<p t="1103220" d="2800">How do you get the hand?</p>
<p t="1106020" d="2240">Well, you know, it took a long time.</p>
<p t="1108260" d="4250">It took almost all of the three and a half
billion years before you managed to come up</p>
<p t="1112510" d="1490">with a hand.</p>
<p t="1114000" d="7120">So, even underneath the microactions, there's
this massive evolutionary history that's been</p>
<p t="1121120" d="4660">built up partially as a consequence of some
of the unchanging features of the environment,</p>
<p t="1125780" d="4920">or at least in consequence to some of the
slower changing features of the environment</p>
<p t="1130700" d="4470">that has given you this incredibly complex
body that's really good at doing some things</p>
<p t="1135170" d="2630">and not really good at doing other things
at all.</p>
<p t="1137800" d="4140">And so, that's how you solve the relevance
problem, and I actually think it's one of</p>
<p t="1141940" d="5230">the most powerful arguments for the necessity
of evolutionary theory.</p>
<p t="1147170" d="4420">It's like this problem is so complex because
it's not only how you have to adapt to the</p>
<p t="1151590" d="1480">environment across time.</p>
<p t="1153070" d="2310">So you have to build a body that adapts to
the environment.</p>
<p t="1155380" d="1240">It's worse than that.</p>
<p t="1156620" d="2720">It's like the train passing through the
box.</p>
<p t="1159340" d="1500">The environment is not stable.</p>
<p t="1160840" d="4710">It keeps shifting and turning and moving and
twisting, and so not only do you have to adapt</p>
<p t="1165550" d="9540">to the environment, you have to adapt flexibly
to the environment while it transforms itself</p>
<p t="1175090" d="5480">at different levels of totality because sometimes
there's minor changes to the environment.</p>
<p t="1180570" d="4480">Sometimes a meteor hits the Earth and we're
plunged into darkness for four years, or there's</p>
<p t="1185050" d="1620">an ice age or something like that.</p>
<p t="1186670" d="5450">So the levels of transformation in the environment
can be radical and the evolutionary process</p>
<p t="1192120" d="1660">has to keep up with that.</p>
<p t="1193780" d="3890">The way it works, apparently, like I don't
believe this is the whole story although it's</p>
<p t="1197670" d="5170">more or less the whole Darwinian story is
that something more or less works and it makes</p>
<p t="1202840" d="5170">a million copies of itself and there's tiny
variations in those copies often at least</p>
<p t="1208010" d="4580">in principle because of copying error which
is where I think the theory is weak.</p>
<p t="1212590" d="2460">And then they all die except for two.</p>
<p t="1215050" d="4840">And so, why didn't those die, and the answer
is well they happened by chance to vary in</p>
<p t="1219890" d="4520">the direction that the environment varied
and so they get to continue and so the reason</p>
<p t="1224410" d="3600">evolution works is that everything dies.</p>
<p t="1228010" d="4550">Everything fails because you think well, keeping
up with a randomly changing environment is</p>
<p t="1232560" d="2300">impossible, so how do you do it?</p>
<p t="1234860" d="1980">Well you do a million things.</p>
<p t="1236840" d="6060">Most of them don't work, but you only have
to succeed enough to propagate yourself once.</p>
<p t="1242900" d="6120">Now, so I think that that's not exactly
right because I don't believe that our understanding</p>
<p t="1249020" d="1300">of evolution is complete.</p>
<p t="1250320" d="1690">There's a bunch of things that I don't believe
in.</p>
<p t="1252010" d="3330">One is DNA is pretty damn complex.</p>
<p t="1255340" d="4700">It's not obvious how it could have evolved,
and even the people who discovered DNA were</p>
<p t="1260040" d="2960">very very complexed that it existed.</p>
<p t="1263000" d="3302">So one of them - and I told you this - thought
that it came from outer space and that it</p>
<p t="1266302" d="2198">had evolved from somewhere else.</p>
<p t="1268500" d="7060">You might think about that as crazy theory
but cosmic winds, like solar winds and that</p>
<p t="1275560" d="6120">kind of thing, can propel tiny things vast
distances relatively rapidly, and over 13.5</p>
<p t="1281680" d="2750">billion years you can really get around.</p>
<p t="1284430" d="5720">I think the estimates, even if you used sub
- if you used transportation methods that</p>
<p t="1290150" d="3800">are about the speed that we have, you can
colonize the whole galaxy in some like 20</p>
<p t="1293950" d="3150">million years because it's exponential.</p>
<p t="1297100" d="5920">20 million years is a tiny tiny subset of
3.5 billion years so it's not as far fetched</p>
<p t="1303020" d="1000">as it sounds.</p>
<p t="1304020" d="1830">The problem is it doesn't address the problem.</p>
<p t="1305850" d="2870">Okay it came from somewhere else, but how
did it get there?</p>
<p t="1308720" d="1950">It just pushes the problem back.</p>
<p t="1310670" d="5321">But there's this other issue too which is
called epigenesis, and that's really put an</p>
<p t="1315991" d="4649">old spoke in the scientific wheels in the
last twenty years because the theory was,</p>
<p t="1320640" d="7490">twenty years ago, that all evolution preceded
through random mutation, and it was random.</p>
<p t="1328130" d="4380">But it turns out that's not exactly right
because there had been a number of demonstrations</p>
<p t="1332510" d="5890">that if something happens to generation A,
that will produce a transformation in the</p>
<p t="1338400" d="6640">genetic information that's transferred to
generation B. And the transformation often</p>
<p t="1345040" d="5990">seems not merely as a consequence of damage,
but actually a form of adaptation to the new</p>
<p t="1351030" d="2570">environment.</p>
<p t="1353600" d="6010">Now that's a tough one, like twenty years
ago when I was studying evolutionary psychology</p>
<p t="1359610" d="5200">and evolutionary biology, if someone would
have said, well you can transmit acquired</p>
<p t="1364810" d="4740">characteristics, it would have been like you're
over there with the creationists because that</p>
<p t="1369550" d="1000">was no go.</p>
<p t="1370550" d="1450">That was against the rules.</p>
<p t="1372000" d="5010">But it does happen, and the fact that epigenesis
happens at all means that there's a lot of</p>
<p t="1377010" d="2670">things about how DNA works that we don't know.</p>
<p t="1379680" d="6980">I actually think what's happening is that
DNA is a very very complex microcomputer,</p>
<p t="1386660" d="3370">and I don't know exactly how it operates,
maybe it's a quantum computer.</p>
<p t="1390030" d="1510">It's very complex.</p>
<p t="1391540" d="4230">Remember it's had three and a half billion
years to figure out what's going on, and it's</p>
<p t="1395770" d="1430">pretty good at surviving.</p>
<p t="1397200" d="5090">So you don't want to underestimate it, and
the structures it builds at the molecular</p>
<p t="1402290" d="5460">level are so complex it just - if you - there's
some great animations of those things going</p>
<p t="1407750" d="1640">on at the molecular level on the net.</p>
<p t="1409390" d="4620">They're so complex that you can't help but
think of them as computational when you watch</p>
<p t="1414010" d="1000">them.</p>
<p t="1415010" d="1290">They're not random processes man.</p>
<p t="1416300" d="6620">Like I watched the little molecule that checks
for error in a DNA replication string.</p>
<p t="1422920" d="6010">I mean, it checks for errors in a DNA replication
string man.</p>
<p t="1428930" d="4490">To figure out how it does something like that
without some form of computation strikes me</p>
<p t="1433420" d="1360">as impossible.</p>
<p t="1434780" d="4950">Anyways I think what happens is that over
time the DNA plays, like it can manifest itself</p>
<p t="1439730" d="4050">in many different forms and it also capitalizes
on mutation.</p>
<p t="1443780" d="1750">I think that's how it works.</p>
<p t="1445530" d="5430">Now you know there's other I'd say kind
of weak evidence for that.</p>
<p t="1450960" d="4930">Maybe it's only evidence by analogy but
if I take one of you and I put you in a radically</p>
<p t="1455890" d="4990">new environment, new genes will turn on in
your brain and code for new proteins and so</p>
<p t="1460880" d="4440">it's like you're sitting there but in some
sense there's a whole set of potential yous</p>
<p t="1465320" d="1000">that are sitting there.</p>
<p t="1466320" d="3730">A lot of that potential is actually locked
in the genetic code.</p>
<p t="1470050" d="4259">I mean, it's dependant on the information
that's in the environment around it cause</p>
<p t="1474309" d="3551">it's not all in the code but it's enough
to get the process started.</p>
<p t="1477860" d="4930">So if I take you out of situation A and put
you in situation B, you build new brain structures</p>
<p t="1482790" d="1410">at the microlevel.</p>
<p t="1484200" d="1890">So you're actually a different person.</p>
<p t="1486090" d="3740">That's actually a very interesting way of
thinking about the consequences of something</p>
<p t="1489830" d="1570">like exposure in psychotherapy.</p>
<p t="1491400" d="4520">It's like okay, you're all timid and there's
eighteen things you're terrified of.</p>
<p t="1495920" d="1590">You go out and master one of them.</p>
<p t="1497510" d="3200">It's like poof, your brain is the not the
same.</p>
<p t="1500710" d="1090">Maybe you're a little braver.</p>
<p t="1501800" d="3860">And then you go master another one, and a
bunch more of you turns on.</p>
<p t="1505660" d="4940">Now I don't know if one thing turns on, something
else turns off.</p>
<p t="1510600" d="3850">You know what I mean is that there's only
so much of you that can be turned on at any</p>
<p t="1514450" d="7970">one time, but maybe a lot of more you can
be turned on than is turned on, so.</p>
<p t="1522420" d="4230">I think it looks like that because people
who really challenge themselves across the</p>
<p t="1526650" d="3750">span of their life, they develop talents in
multiple directions.</p>
<p t="1530400" d="8610">People can really be amazingly good at a ridiculous
number of things.</p>
<p t="1539010" d="9570">Okay so, Sokolov and Vinogradova showed that
you model the world right down to the finest</p>
<p t="1548580" d="7090">details, but then Dan Simon and his crew showed
“No you don't, you're so blind you can't</p>
<p t="1555670" d="1000">even believe it.”</p>
<p t="1556670" d="6350">It's like okay, those are not the same set
of facts, so how do we reconcile that?</p>
<p t="1563020" d="4000">Well here's one way of getting a bit of
sense of it.</p>
<p t="1567020" d="1550">Look straight ahead.</p>
<p t="1568570" d="6640">Okay, now concentrate not on what you see
in the middle of your vision but at the sides.</p>
<p t="1575210" d="2790">It's probably better if you look at a person
to do that, but it doesn't really matter</p>
<p t="1578000" d="1000">though.</p>
<p t="1579000" d="4940">So look straight ahead but pay attention to
what you see in the periphery.</p>
<p t="1583940" d="5560">So I can tell you what you'll see because
some of it is very difficult to detect.</p>
<p t="1589500" d="3550">Way out in the periphery, it's black and
white.</p>
<p t="1593050" d="1580">You can't tell that though.</p>
<p t="1594630" d="3590">But we know that because if we change colors
way out in the periphery on you, you can't</p>
<p t="1598220" d="1530">detect a change.</p>
<p t="1599750" d="4670">And then out to about here, if something isn't
moving, it's almost impossible to see it.</p>
<p t="1604420" d="3300">But as soon as it moves, you can see that
there's something moving.</p>
<p t="1607720" d="2020">Sort of like dinosaur vision.</p>
<p t="1609740" d="2400">Remember Jurassic Park?</p>
<p t="1612140" d="2390">Don't move because the dinosaur can see
you.</p>
<p t="1614530" d="4841">It's like well, you have dinosaur movement
detector still built into your nervous system.</p>
<p t="1619371" d="6009">And the answer is why, and the answer is well
if you can't afford to have a lot of your</p>
<p t="1625380" d="5461">brain wired up in the periphery of your vision
because your head is only so big, then you</p>
<p t="1630841" d="4359">have to concentrate on only those things that
are most likely to be relevant.</p>
<p t="1635200" d="4070">And moving things are more likely to be relevant
because they can eat you.</p>
<p t="1639270" d="4039">Moving things are more likely to be relevant
than stationary things especially if you've</p>
<p t="1643309" d="4001">been in the environment for a while right,
because if you're in here it's like the</p>
<p t="1647310" d="3580">stationary things are going to stay stationary
so you can ignore them.</p>
<p t="1650890" d="5060">You don't even have to see them, but the moving
things, they're transforming at a time rate</p>
<p t="1655950" d="3109">that's relevant to you so it's good to
be able to detect those.</p>
<p t="1659059" d="5991">Now the periphery of your vision is actually
wired in more directly to your - to the lower</p>
<p t="1665050" d="2290">levels of your nervous system.</p>
<p t="1667340" d="4741">So it can trigger off things like startle
reflexes which are very rapid, and it can</p>
<p t="1672081" d="4909">also trigger an orienting response which is
the movement of your sensory systems in the</p>
<p t="1676990" d="4920">direction of the stimulus so if something
over here moves, then you go like that, and</p>
<p t="1681910" d="3010">then what you're doing is you're nailing it
with your central vision.</p>
<p t="1684920" d="4920">Now, out in your peripheral vision, if you
follow the optical tract back to your brain,</p>
<p t="1689840" d="7560">you'll see the peripheral retinal nerves don't
attach to a tremendous number of visual cortex</p>
<p t="1697400" d="6580">neurons, but the central ones do so each of
the central neurons in your central vision</p>
<p t="1703980" d="1000">- the fovea.</p>
<p t="1704980" d="5350">Each one of those is connected to ten thousand
neurons at the first level of elaboration,</p>
<p t="1710330" d="3330">and then each neuron is connected to about
ten thousand other neurons.</p>
<p t="1713660" d="5590">So it's ten thousand to the ten thousandth
two neurons in and so a lot of your brain</p>
<p t="1719250" d="5210">is focusing on that tiny little pinpoint that
you use that's foveal vision, and it seems</p>
<p t="1724460" d="6320">to be about big enough so that you can bring
a face into high resolution in the center</p>
<p t="1730780" d="3650">and you can track the movement of the various
elements of the faces.</p>
<p t="1734430" d="4470">If you look at someone and you look about
eighteen inches to their left or to their</p>
<p t="1738900" d="3520">right, you'll see that you can't see their
nose anymore.</p>
<p t="1742420" d="3009">You see kind of a vague outline of their face.</p>
<p t="1745429" d="1431">You can still see the color.</p>
<p t="1746860" d="4120">You can detect their eyebrows, and you can
detect their mouth especially if their mouth</p>
<p t="1750980" d="1620">moves or their eyes move.</p>
<p t="1752600" d="2770">You just zero in on that right away.</p>
<p t="1755370" d="5750">What's happening is that way out here, your
vision is incredibly low resolution and the</p>
<p t="1761120" d="6190">resolution increases to the center where it's
very very high, and then there's some tweaks</p>
<p t="1767310" d="4340">like okay you can't really see out here, but
you can see motion, and that's good enough</p>
<p t="1771650" d="3220">because as soon as something moves, you can
turn your head cause you can turn your head</p>
<p t="1774870" d="4809">and your eyes and you can focus that little
pinpoint on it and dance around cause that's</p>
<p t="1779679" d="1481">what you do with the pinpoint.</p>
<p t="1781160" d="6410">It moves around very rapidly, and you can
scan that central area with high resolution.</p>
<p t="1787570" d="4290">So it's an efficient use of limited resources.</p>
<p t="1791860" d="5290">So partly the way that you manage in the world
which is very very complicated, is that even</p>
<p t="1797150" d="2670">your senses simplify it for you.</p>
<p t="1799820" d="5130">There's only - you can't see the entire spectrum
of electromagnetic radiation.</p>
<p t="1804950" d="1800">You can only see the visual light spectrum.</p>
<p t="1806750" d="1000">It's very narrow.</p>
<p t="1807750" d="2700">There's a whole range of sounds you can't
hear.</p>
<p t="1810450" d="1490">There's things you can't smell.</p>
<p t="1811940" d="4020">So you're in a box and some things get through,
but not everything.</p>
<p t="1815960" d="4820">So that simplifies things for you right off
the bat and hypothetically those things you</p>
<p t="1820780" d="4279">do detect or those things where it was necessary
for you to detect for you to be here, over</p>
<p t="1825059" d="4151">this vast span of time and no doubt there
were variants all the way through that tried</p>
<p t="1829210" d="4330">to parse it up differently - slightly differently
- and that didn't work out as well so they</p>
<p t="1833540" d="1250">aren't around.</p>
<p t="1834790" d="4930">So you're around because of death and replication.</p>
<p t="1839720" d="5980">So it's an interesting take on death, eh,
because you're the product of an unbelievable</p>
<p t="1845700" d="1430">number of deaths.</p>
<p t="1847130" d="6620">Right, because all of those experiments had
to take place in some sense for you to be</p>
<p t="1853750" d="1350">here at all.</p>
<p t="1855100" d="8060">So anyways, okay, then, so you can see with
your central vision that you focus in on one</p>
<p t="1863160" d="6440">point and you reduce the others to low resolution
representations, maybe even cartoons, and</p>
<p t="1869600" d="3560">then I also think, although I don't know this
for sure and someone has undoubtedly done</p>
<p t="1873160" d="1000">the work.</p>
<p t="1874160" d="6120">My suspicions are that in the periphery, you
don't update - you know how your screen updates.</p>
<p t="1880280" d="3180">It's sixty cycles a second, something like
that.</p>
<p t="1883460" d="4560">You update your vision at about sixty cycles
per second, and we know that because if the</p>
<p t="1888020" d="4961">screen resolution or if the screen update
decreases below sixty cycles a second, people</p>
<p t="1892981" d="1979">can start to see it flicker.</p>
<p t="1894960" d="1260">So we have a refresh rate.</p>
<p t="1896220" d="1620">It's around sixty hertz.</p>
<p t="1897840" d="7750">Some people can see flicker at higher hertz
than that, but most people can't.</p>
<p t="1905590" d="1300">Sixty is about right.</p>
<p t="1906890" d="5420">So, that's another way that you deal with
the fact that there's way too much for you</p>
<p t="1912310" d="1690">to deal with.</p>
<p t="1914000" d="4960">Your temporal resolution isn't very high,
you know, so the smallest meaningful event</p>
<p t="1918960" d="2290">for you is about a tenth of a second long.</p>
<p t="1921250" d="4220">Now if you're in a car accident or you're
in some situation where it's an emergency</p>
<p t="1925470" d="4150">and you get a massive burst of dopamine, you
might be able to speed that processing up</p>
<p t="1929620" d="1020">by a hundredfold.</p>
<p t="1930640" d="1040">Who knows?</p>
<p t="1931680" d="3330">But you're gonna be absolutely exhausted instantly
when you do that.</p>
<p t="1935010" d="3360">I don't know if you've ever experienced that
in a car accident or something like that but</p>
<p t="1938370" d="8550">people often report that time slows down dramatically,
but then afterwards they're just done.</p>
<p t="1946920" d="4210">So the reason you don't see a thousand times
as fast as you do is because you'd have</p>
<p t="1951130" d="1440">to be eating like a hummingbird right.</p>
<p t="1952570" d="4530">You'd need a big vat of nectar attached to
you, and you'd just be sipping on it or gulping</p>
<p t="1957100" d="1730">it down nonstop.</p>
<p t="1958830" d="4410">So you're also restricted in terms of your
temporal resolution.</p>
<p t="1963240" d="5420">Okay, well then what else do you do to simplify
the world.</p>
<p t="1968660" d="9769">Well this is where the tool concept of concept,
the tool concept of concept starts to become</p>
<p t="1978429" d="6451">useful because you're actually aiming at things
all the time, and I really like the aim metaphor</p>
<p t="1984880" d="5210">because if you understand the metaphor well,
it really sheds some light on what human beings</p>
<p t="1990090" d="2250">are like.</p>
<p t="1992340" d="3620">Chimps are hunters, but they're not hunters
like human beings are hunters.</p>
<p t="1995960" d="1480">We're really really good hunters.</p>
<p t="1997440" d="4450">Chimps, they have to kind of mob an animal
and then they'll tear it apart, and they</p>
<p t="2001890" d="2200">like meat so they'll definitely do it.</p>
<p t="2004090" d="4839">But human beings have been hunting in an unbelievably
sophisticated way for a tremendous amount</p>
<p t="2008929" d="4811">of time, and there's a bunch of things about
us that aren't like chimps.</p>
<p t="2013740" d="4220">So one is we can throw, and our bodies are
built for throwing.</p>
<p t="2017960" d="3220">Now you might think well that's not that relevant
but if something is chasing you through the</p>
<p t="2021180" d="4119">bush and you can throw a rock at it, it becomes
relevant very quickly.</p>
<p t="2025299" d="6401">And so we're really good at taking projectiles,
specifying targets, and hurling the projectiles</p>
<p t="2031700" d="1130">at targets.</p>
<p t="2032830" d="3590">And we can do that with rocks, and we can
do it with bows, and we can do it with rifles,</p>
<p t="2036420" d="3540">and we can do it with rifles, and we can do
it with nuclear weapons.</p>
<p t="2039960" d="4230">And so there's something about us that's obsessed
with hitting the middle of the target.</p>
<p t="2044190" d="7100">Now there's an interesting side note for that
which is that the word sin is derived from</p>
<p t="2051290" d="5780">the Greek word “Hamartia,” and hamartia
is an archery term to mean to miss the center</p>
<p t="2057070" d="1720">of the target.</p>
<p t="2058790" d="2510">Now that's something very much worth thinking
about.</p>
<p t="2061300" d="1970">It's a very lovely concordance.</p>
<p t="2063270" d="2720">So we're built on this hunting platform.</p>
<p t="2065990" d="2510">We can track moving things extraordinarily
well.</p>
<p t="2068500" d="1520">We have amazing eyesight.</p>
<p t="2070020" d="4550">Our eyesight's better than any primate by
a huge amount, and better than any other creature</p>
<p t="2074570" d="2510">except for hawks and other birds of prey.</p>
<p t="2077080" d="6300">So, and, we also use - so we have this intense,
amazing capacity to zero in and here's some</p>
<p t="2083380" d="1300">cool things about your eyes.</p>
<p t="2084680" d="3790">So, if you look at a gorilla, you'll see
that a gorilla doesn't really have whites</p>
<p t="2088470" d="4570">in their eyes, and you might think well that's
kind of weird because we do, and so what's</p>
<p t="2093040" d="1190">the hypothesis?</p>
<p t="2094230" d="5530">Well, if I'm looking at somebody at the
back of the room, I can tell if they're looking</p>
<p t="2099760" d="1790">at my eyes.</p>
<p t="2101550" d="3880">If they're looking at my nose, it's almost
as if their face just gets a little bit vaguer</p>
<p t="2105430" d="1000">like we're not communicating.</p>
<p t="2106430" d="2560">It's eye to eye contact.</p>
<p t="2108990" d="6369">So our ability to specify the direction in
which another person's eyes are pointing</p>
<p t="2115359" d="1771">is phenomenal.</p>
<p t="2117130" d="1730">And you might say, well why?</p>
<p t="2118860" d="4140">Well first of all, there's a lot of expression
around the eyes right.</p>
<p t="2123000" d="1950">So you can imagine coevolution.</p>
<p t="2124950" d="3350">The coevolution is sharper and sharper vision.</p>
<p t="2128300" d="5530">Vision associated with detecting eyes and
then also more and more evolution for emotional</p>
<p t="2133830" d="2250">expression around the eyes.</p>
<p t="2136080" d="1680">So there's that.</p>
<p t="2137760" d="4150">But then, the other thing that I wanted - the
reason that I would be interested in that</p>
<p t="2141910" d="4430">is because I want to know what the hell you're
up to because maybe you're a friend and maybe</p>
<p t="2146340" d="3651">you're a foe or maybe you're interested in
something that I should be interested in.</p>
<p t="2149991" d="4030">So we know what people are like in that regard,
so you go stand out in the corner and you</p>
<p t="2154021" d="4379">look up, and soon there are ten people you
have around you looking up.</p>
<p t="2158400" d="1000">And why is that?</p>
<p t="2159400" d="7100">It's because when they see where your eyes
are pointed and embody you, they think well</p>
<p t="2166500" d="1520">that person - they don't think this.</p>
<p t="2168020" d="1820">It's the equivalent of thinking.</p>
<p t="2169840" d="3450">They think well that person must be looking
at something interesting because that's what</p>
<p t="2173290" d="3970">people look at, and if it's interesting
to them then it's probably going to be interesting</p>
<p t="2177260" d="1860">to me especially if it's in the sky.</p>
<p t="2179120" d="2890">It's like what the hell, that's not supposed
to be happening.</p>
<p t="2182010" d="3590">So you're looking at people's eyes because
you want to know what they're up to in their</p>
<p t="2185600" d="6450">facial display, which is your face is unbelievably
innervated and controllable, both by conscious</p>
<p t="2192050" d="1660">and by unconscious means.</p>
<p t="2193710" d="3580">That tells you what they're up to, which is
why you want to see someone's face.</p>
<p t="2197290" d="1490">You don't talk to the back of their head.</p>
<p t="2198780" d="3339">You want to talk to their face, and you don't
like it when they're looking like this or</p>
<p t="2202119" d="3381">looking like that or failing to make eye contact.</p>
<p t="2205500" d="2940">Although too much eye contact is a predatory
stare.</p>
<p t="2208440" d="3680">So you know, you've got -
Well you've got to get the balance right.</p>
<p t="2212120" d="3570">So now, what about the whites of the eyes?</p>
<p t="2215690" d="3500">Well the theory is that the reason we've
developed whites is because it was easier</p>
<p t="2219190" d="4419">to see where someone's eyes were pointed
if there was a dark circle in a white space,</p>
<p t="2223609" d="4961">and what that basically meant was that all
your ancestors who were a little less fortunate</p>
<p t="2228570" d="4430">on the eye white side either didn't mate or
got killed.</p>
<p t="2233000" d="1690">Probably in misunderstandings.</p>
<p t="2234690" d="5669">So, our eyes stand out against this bright
white background because that helps us - that</p>
<p t="2240359" d="4021">helps other people detect what we're up
to, and that means we can trust each other</p>
<p t="2244380" d="5800">more easily and we can - even as something
as simple as like eye contact in a situation</p>
<p t="2250180" d="5020">where there's a possibility of finding a
sexual partner is a very important component</p>
<p t="2255200" d="5150">of that because eye contact indicates interest
and it also indicates, at least in principle,</p>
<p t="2260350" d="2160">the possibility of approach.</p>
<p t="2262510" d="6380">And so approach is dopaminergically mediated
and it's a positive emotional state.</p>
<p t="2268890" d="7160">And that's also why, interestingly enough,
if you go into a pharmacy, and there's a rack</p>
<p t="2276050" d="3670">of magazines, and they're - what's on the
cover?</p>
<p t="2279720" d="1010">Always.</p>
<p t="2280730" d="1040">Almost always.</p>
<p t="2281770" d="1520">Beautiful women.</p>
<p t="2283290" d="4370">Like on fifty percent of the men's magazines
there's a beautiful woman and on like a hundred</p>
<p t="2287660" d="4080">percent of the women's magazines which is
really interesting you know because you might</p>
<p t="2291740" d="2090">think well why is that?</p>
<p t="2293830" d="4610">Women's eyes are always looking out in a
way that they're looking at you.</p>
<p t="2298440" d="6620">So there was some interest - so it's an
invocation of interest, and so, you know,</p>
<p t="2305060" d="1000">magazines evolve.</p>
<p t="2306060" d="1970">All the ones that don't get bought fail.</p>
<p t="2308030" d="3310">And so what's happened is they've all converged
to the same point, and the same point is that</p>
<p t="2311340" d="6670">the thing that's maximally interesting to
a magazine purchaser is a beautiful female</p>
<p t="2318010" d="1000">face.</p>
<p t="2319010" d="1000">Whether it's male or female.</p>
<p t="2320010" d="3920">Now on the male side, there's also gadgets
of all sorts.</p>
<p t="2323930" d="3270">And that may be that men are more gadgets
oriented than women.</p>
<p t="2327200" d="6900">So anyways, and we also know that for example
with men, if you show them - this is a funny</p>
<p t="2334100" d="1810">little study.</p>
<p t="2335910" d="5700">So you show them a face of a beautiful woman
and her eyes are looking that way, or this</p>
<p t="2341610" d="4790">way or they're looking right at him, you can
check the activity in the dopaminergic center</p>
<p t="2346400" d="4709">in a place called the nucleus accumbens which
is the same that cocaine hits.</p>
<p t="2351109" d="2431">Face on eye contact, that thing lights up.</p>
<p t="2353540" d="3079">It lights up even more if she's wearing
a red dress.</p>
<p t="2356619" d="5321">Right, and you can get the same kind of lighting
up with a red curvy sports car.</p>
<p t="2361940" d="1000">Yeah.</p>
<p t="2362940" d="6640">So it's the, you know - my thought when
I read that was the perfect situation is like</p>
<p t="2369580" d="6230">a beautiful girl dressed in red perched on
a sports car, with some cocaine.</p>
<p t="2375810" d="3940">Why red?</p>
<p t="2379750" d="1180">Why red?</p>
<p t="2380930" d="1439">That's a good question.</p>
<p t="2382369" d="2311">I'm not exactly sure why - oh that's wrong.</p>
<p t="2384680" d="3250">I do know why red.</p>
<p t="2387930" d="2899">Ripe fruit.</p>
<p t="2390829" d="2171">Women have coevolved with ripe fruit.</p>
<p t="2393000" d="2820">It's very sneaky of you by the way.</p>
<p t="2395820" d="1371">So that's why - you know that too.</p>
<p t="2397191" d="2569">You just have to leaf through a women's
magazine.</p>
<p t="2399760" d="4330">Lipstick is always associated with like apples
that are glistening in some way, or a peach</p>
<p t="2404090" d="1610">or something like that.</p>
<p t="2405700" d="6060">And we were primarily fruit eaters, and the
reason we have color vision is to detect fruit,</p>
<p t="2411760" d="1430">ripe fruit.</p>
<p t="2413190" d="4429">So part of the reason that - also part of
the reason that fruit turns red or colors</p>
<p t="2417619" d="4531">when it ripens is because the fruit that was
successfully eaten by creatures that distributed</p>
<p t="2422150" d="4380">the seeds was the fruit that was ripe when
it was eaten.</p>
<p t="2426530" d="4620">So as the color vision evolved, maybe there
was a red tint for only god knows what reason,</p>
<p t="2431150" d="4610">then a positive feedback loop developed and
fruit got redder and redder, and at the same</p>
<p t="2435760" d="2460">time, women capitalized on that.</p>
<p t="2438220" d="5120">So that's partly, I think, what explains
the association between Eve and the apple</p>
<p t="2443340" d="5310">in Genesis because Genesis is also a story
about gaining sight.</p>
<p t="2448650" d="1610">So yeah, that's why red.</p>
<p t="2450260" d="1530">That's pretty funny.</p>
<p t="2451790" d="2150">I really think that's pretty funny.</p>
<p t="2453940" d="6320">You know, evolved sensory significance is
absolutely everywhere.</p>
<p t="2460260" d="5109">It's so deep inside of us.</p>
<p t="2465369" d="1661">Yeah.</p>
<p t="2467030" d="2000">I have to wonder about blood too, that seems
like it also</p>
<p t="2469030" d="1000">Oh yeah, yeah.</p>
<p t="2470030" d="3670">Red's a significant color, but I think - I
mean and it's funny too because say there's</p>
<p t="2473700" d="3399">a flushed face, well that means it's infused
with blood.</p>
<p t="2477099" d="1681">It's also a sign of health.</p>
<p t="2478780" d="2280">It's also a sign of sexual arousal.</p>
<p t="2481060" d="6000">But it is a sign of health, and so you see
in old Coke ads from the 1930's, the girl's</p>
<p t="2487060" d="3289">cheeks are so red it looks like she has a
fever.</p>
<p t="2490349" d="5991">So it's a form of sexual signalling that
indicates health.</p>
<p t="2496340" d="1000">So that's another part.</p>
<p t="2497340" d="3810">I mean these are multiply determined right,
as anything as complex as vision.</p>
<p t="2501150" d="4170">Yeah, and blood means “Hey, maybe don't
go there” or maybe it means there's something</p>
<p t="2505320" d="1000">to eat.</p>
<p t="2506320" d="1000">Right, right.</p>
<p t="2507320" d="1000">Yup.</p>
<p t="2508320" d="4539">There was another theory with color sight,
and it had to do with people's facial expressions</p>
<p t="2512859" d="7171">- not expressions but depending on whether
you're angry or aroused.</p>
<p t="2520030" d="4350">Oh definitely, you can see that those things
would loop together.</p>
<p t="2524380" d="6030">Once the color vision starts to adapt, the
color vision for fruit is way older, I would</p>
<p t="2530410" d="4170">suspect, because when we developed it, we
had fur.</p>
<p t="2534580" d="4960">But once the ability's there and we lose
our facial fur, it's possible to capitalize</p>
<p t="2539540" d="2450">on the ability to detect the signalling.</p>
<p t="2541990" d="4380">And you know, we're talking about a transformation
that's over about - we were living in trees</p>
<p t="2546370" d="2220">about sixty million years ago.</p>
<p t="2548590" d="3910">So the transition between us and them is sixty
million years.</p>
<p t="2552500" d="3680">The separation between chimps is about seven.</p>
<p t="2556180" d="9170">And you know, chimp skin is so dark, you're
not gonna get a lot of signalling.</p>
<p t="2565350" d="2900">Okay so, back to this little diagram.</p>
<p t="2568250" d="3070">Now here's the idea.</p>
<p t="2571320" d="5710">This is deeply informed, although I didn't
know it when I was working on these ideas,</p>
<p t="2577030" d="6470">this is deeply informed by a guy named Norbert
Wiener who was one of the twentieth century's</p>
<p t="2583500" d="6490">massive geniuses and a force behind the development
of computation.</p>
<p t="2589990" d="1760">So this is a cybernetic model.</p>
<p t="2591750" d="1860">He invented cybernetics.</p>
<p t="2593610" d="6130">Now I didn't learn this from Norbert Wiener
because I learned it from Jeffrey Gray, but</p>
<p t="2599740" d="3780">Jeffrey Gray's source had learned it from
Norbert Wiener way back in the 1940's.</p>
<p t="2603520" d="4850">In fact there was a convention back in the
1940's that Wiener presented many of his</p>
<p t="2608370" d="4580">ideas at that many psychologists attended,
including Jean Piaget.</p>
<p t="2612950" d="4399">So Piaget's theory is very much influenced
by cybernetics as well.</p>
<p t="2617349" d="5701">Many many of the standard psychology cognitive
models are cybernetic.</p>
<p t="2623050" d="3940">So they're grounded in thinking that's grounded
in the engineering thinking and not psychological</p>
<p t="2626990" d="1180">thinking at all.</p>
<p t="2628170" d="1000">Yup.</p>
<p t="2629170" d="3930">Isn't Humberd's book called Cybernetics?]</p>
<p t="2633100" d="1650">No, Dianetics.</p>
<p t="2634750" d="1650">Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p t="2636400" d="7630">Okay so, how might you conceptualize the fundamental
elements of a personality.</p>
<p t="2644030" d="2860">Well, this is what it looks like to me.</p>
<p t="2646890" d="3300">The first thing is you're a moving creature.</p>
<p t="2650190" d="1090">So here's a funny story.</p>
<p t="2651280" d="6260">There's a little animal whose name I forget,
and in its - it's an ocean animal - in its</p>
<p t="2657540" d="2840">juvenile state, it swims around.</p>
<p t="2660380" d="5680">Okay so in its juvenile state, it has to coordinate
its movements and interact with the changing</p>
<p t="2666060" d="1390">environment.</p>
<p t="2667450" d="1570">So it has a brain.</p>
<p t="2669020" d="4480">But when it turns into an adult, it attaches
itself to a rock and turns into something</p>
<p t="2673500" d="1620">like a piece of coral.</p>
<p t="2675120" d="3110">It promptly digests its own brain.</p>
<p t="2678230" d="4210">So the issue is unless you don't really need
a brain if you're not gonna go anywhere right.</p>
<p t="2682440" d="4950">So a brain is a going places thing, and we
have a very big brain and so it's like we're</p>
<p t="2687390" d="4570">always zooming around doing things, and we've
got these hands that enable us to manipulate</p>
<p t="2691960" d="1570">things and transform things.</p>
<p t="2693530" d="4500">So the brain is for doing things, it's not
just for perceiving.</p>
<p t="2698030" d="5000">Roughly speaking, the back half of your brain
is for perception, the cortical part.</p>
<p t="2703030" d="2670">Mostly visual perception, but some auditory
and touch.</p>
<p t="2705700" d="4180">A lot of visual, and the front part is for
output.</p>
<p t="2709880" d="1229">Motor action.</p>
<p t="2711109" d="5131">And as you proceed - imagine the front part
starts halfway here.</p>
<p t="2716240" d="5180">As you proceed from the midline forward, the
action becomes more and more abstract until</p>
<p t="2721420" d="4750">when you're dealing with the dorsolateral
prefrontal cortex, you're thinking abstractly.</p>
<p t="2726170" d="4010">Now people think that when they're thinking
abstractly, they're thinking about representations</p>
<p t="2730180" d="5140">of the world because we think about objects,
but that isn't what we're doing.</p>
<p t="2735320" d="4910">What we're doing is rehearsing potential
schemas of action.</p>
<p t="2740230" d="4560">So we have this abstract space, which you
might think about as a duplicate world.</p>
<p t="2744790" d="1430">You have an idea.</p>
<p t="2746220" d="5360">You test the idea like you would test it if
you were acting in the world, and the consequence</p>
<p t="2751580" d="5080">of the imaginary testing is if you encounter
grief, then you don't implement the idea in</p>
<p t="2756660" d="1070">the world.</p>
<p t="2757730" d="3540">Now you know, that doesn't always work because
there's trade offs between short term pleasure</p>
<p t="2761270" d="4980">and long term punishment that makes it complicated,
but what seems to have happened is that as</p>
<p t="2766250" d="4560">we've evolved, we're very sneaky creatures
you know.</p>
<p t="2770810" d="4240">For billions of years, the only way that you
could figure out whether you're right or wrong</p>
<p t="2775050" d="3710">was to go out and do something, and if you
died you were wrong.</p>
<p t="2778760" d="5870">But now, you can think about doing something
and if the consequence of running the simulation</p>
<p t="2784630" d="3940">in your head is that you die, then you don't
do it.</p>
<p t="2788570" d="6340">So what you're basically doing is spinning
off multiple potential use in multiple potential</p>
<p t="2794910" d="2570">universes and running them as simulations.</p>
<p t="2797480" d="3889">Now we really do that now because we've
externalized it onto the computer which is</p>
<p t="2801369" d="2721">what we're doing with really really complex
video games.</p>
<p t="2804090" d="1870">So it's so smart.</p>
<p t="2805960" d="2750">It's an amazing evolutionary advance.</p>
<p t="2808710" d="5360">Now it doesn't work that well because sometimes
you run the simulation and you think, this</p>
<p t="2814070" d="4520">is a stupid idea, and you promptly have eight
beers so that you can go do it.</p>
<p t="2818590" d="5800">But, all things considered, that's still
what this abstract space is for.</p>
<p t="2824390" d="4460">I should tell you something about this too
because you're gonna hear from neuropsychologists</p>
<p t="2828850" d="5269">that a lot of what the dorsolateral prefrontal
cortex does is - the cortex in general - is</p>
<p t="2834119" d="2811">impulse control, and that's wrong.</p>
<p t="2836930" d="2280">That is not what it does.</p>
<p t="2839210" d="5070">And part of the reason I know this is because
the correlation between prefrontal cortical</p>
<p t="2844280" d="4900">cognitive ability which is very tightly associated
with IQ by the way.</p>
<p t="2849180" d="4310">The correlation is like 0.9 so you can even
argue it's the same thing.</p>
<p t="2853490" d="1460">Fluid IQ in particular.</p>
<p t="2854950" d="8380">The correlation between dorsolateral prefrontal
cognitive capacity and conscientiousness which</p>
<p t="2863330" d="8180">is like long term goal directed, future oriented,
planned activity is zero.</p>
<p t="2871510" d="3109">Okay zero is a very bad correlation.</p>
<p t="2874619" d="5181">You know the old idea, correlation doesn't
imply causality.</p>
<p t="2879800" d="1180">Well, wrong.</p>
<p t="2880980" d="2119">It does strongly imply causality.</p>
<p t="2883099" d="5081">It doesn't demonstrate it because with every
causal relationship, there's a correlation</p>
<p t="2888180" d="5160">so a hundred percent of causally related items
have a correlation right.</p>
<p t="2893340" d="2190">A hundred percent correlation.</p>
<p t="2895530" d="4800">Well not necessarily, but it implies correlation
but it does not prove it.</p>
<p t="2900330" d="2420">But zero.</p>
<p t="2902750" d="2420">That's bad.</p>
<p t="2905170" d="1590">That means those things aren't related.</p>
<p t="2906760" d="3030">Now, if you think about it, you can understand
why.</p>
<p t="2909790" d="7490">They have to be unrelated because if you embodied
your abstractions, then you wouldn't be able</p>
<p t="2917280" d="1420">to experiment with them.</p>
<p t="2918700" d="2860">You'd just act them out and then bang you'd
be dead.</p>
<p t="2921560" d="5260">So you have to separate the cognitive activity
from the embodiment completely so you can</p>
<p t="2926820" d="4740">choose which of your potential selves to incarnate
so to speak.</p>
<p t="2931560" d="6190">Now, the prefrontal cortex is a complex place,
and the lower parts of it seem to be more</p>
<p t="2937750" d="5750">related to the relation between cognitive
activity and the control of behavior.</p>
<p t="2943500" d="4680">But we have tried fifty tasks, I bet, trying
to get a correlation with conscientiousness</p>
<p t="2948180" d="2520">and we haven't found one.</p>
<p t="2950700" d="1010">We cannot.</p>
<p t="2951710" d="3100">The reason I'm telling you this is because
conscientiousness is a very good predictor</p>
<p t="2954810" d="3360">of long term life success.</p>
<p t="2958170" d="1919">You guys get your grades for two reasons.</p>
<p t="2960089" d="5071">One, you're smart - assuming you are - and
two, that you work hard - assuming that you</p>
<p t="2965160" d="1000">do.</p>
<p t="2966160" d="2350">That eats up almost all the variance in your
grades.</p>
<p t="2968510" d="5099">Creativity is zero correlation with grades
at U of T, by the way which I think is extraordinarily</p>
<p t="2973609" d="3411">comical, and completely unsurprising.</p>
<p t="2977020" d="6870">It's hard for an institution to grade creativity
cause it's an institution, and the problem</p>
<p t="2983890" d="4969">with being creative is that you force people
to come up with a new grading scheme.</p>
<p t="2988859" d="2291">It's like no, they're not gonna do that.</p>
<p t="2991150" d="3120">Right, because you come up with something
creative, it's different.</p>
<p t="2994270" d="1000">Well what do you do with that?</p>
<p t="2995270" d="1000">You say, don't do that.</p>
<p t="2996270" d="2250">That's not what I want, even if it's a
great thing.</p>
<p t="2998520" d="3060">It's like yeah yeah, take your great thing
and go somewhere else with it.</p>
<p t="3001580" d="3160">I've got five minutes to mark your damn
paper.</p>
<p t="3004740" d="9360">So anyways, this capacity for abstraction
is divorced almost completely from embodiment,</p>
<p t="3014100" d="1920">and that's a good thing because that allows
us to experiment.</p>
<p t="3016020" d="5460">But it's a bad thing because actually doing
the embodiment turns out to be very difficult.</p>
<p t="3021480" d="3869">It's like your body's got all these habits
built into it that you've been working on</p>
<p t="3025349" d="1391">for a long time.</p>
<p t="3026740" d="1290">Here's another piece of advice.</p>
<p t="3028030" d="6030">Do not practice things that you don't want
to become because one of the things that happens.</p>
<p t="3034060" d="6840">Let's say you take Danish speakers and you
play Danish backwards to them, and you do</p>
<p t="3040900" d="1260">a scan of brain activity.</p>
<p t="3042160" d="3390">It's like their brain's lighting up like
mad because they don't know how to say Danish</p>
<p t="3045550" d="5020">backwards, so you get a whole bunch of brain
involved in a new task.</p>
<p t="3050570" d="6299">But then as you practice the task, and routinize
it, less and less brain is involved.</p>
<p t="3056869" d="4611">So what happens is - this is in your standard,
right-hand male and the reason I'm doing</p>
<p t="3061480" d="4889">that as an example is that's kind of the
simplest default brain in a sense.</p>
<p t="3066369" d="4321">Women are more diffusely organized, and so
it's harder to exactly talk about their</p>
<p t="3070690" d="6480">neurological structure in a simple way, but
in a right-handed male, what happens is the</p>
<p t="3077170" d="4900">activity starts to shift to the left, and
then it shifts backwards, and as it does so,</p>
<p t="3082070" d="3890">the amount of tissue that gets activated gets
smaller and smaller and smaller and smaller</p>
<p t="3085960" d="4400">until you've built a little machine that takes
care of that sort of thing.</p>
<p t="3090360" d="2410">But the thing about that machine is that it's
a machine.</p>
<p t="3092770" d="2340">It's a habit, and it's actually there.</p>
<p t="3095110" d="2230">It's built into you.</p>
<p t="3097340" d="4250">So be careful what you practise because if
you practise it enough, it becomes - it's</p>
<p t="3101590" d="1000">like it's you.</p>
<p t="3102590" d="1380">It's the default you.</p>
<p t="3103970" d="5670">And then if you want to change it, you can't
just undo that stupid machine.</p>
<p t="3109640" d="1000">It's there permanently.</p>
<p t="3110640" d="5030">What you have to do is you have to build another
little machine that shuts it off, and then</p>
<p t="3115670" d="3340">another machine that does the other thing,
and then if you get stressed the little machine</p>
<p t="3119010" d="5370">that shuts the first machine off will stop
working and back your stupid habit will come.</p>
<p t="3124380" d="5150">So, people used to talk about the development
of character, and there was something about</p>
<p t="3129530" d="6050">that that was absolutely right because character
is how you build yourself across time, and</p>
<p t="3135580" d="1870">it really really matters.</p>
<p t="3137450" d="2340">Only practise what you want to become.</p>
<p t="3139790" d="3130">If you practise other things, then well you'll
become them.</p>
<p t="3142920" d="2310">That's not so good.</p>
<p t="3145230" d="3590">Okay, so back to this.</p>
<p t="3148820" d="2779">Now, Gray and Sokolov and Vinogradova.</p>
<p t="3151599" d="1760">We're gonna talk about them for a minute.</p>
<p t="3153359" d="2851">Now, they used to talk about animals.</p>
<p t="3156210" d="5740">They're mostly thinking about animals - rats,
mostly - as having an expectancy model.</p>
<p t="3161950" d="1610">So you take a rat.</p>
<p t="3163560" d="3070">You throw him in a new environment.</p>
<p t="3166630" d="1110">What does he do?</p>
<p t="3167740" d="4520">Well the first he does is freeze because god
only knows what's out there.</p>
<p t="3172260" d="3250">So it's like paralyzed rat; he's just
seen the Medusa.</p>
<p t="3175510" d="6070">He's paralyzed, and then if nothing attacks
him, he starts to calm down a bit and then</p>
<p t="3181580" d="2970">he'll start sniffing because rats are all
smell.</p>
<p t="3184550" d="4080">And he sniffs around, and he's trying to
detect cats, say.</p>
<p t="3188630" d="3320">Now, rats have such a good sense of smell.</p>
<p t="3191950" d="4000">If a rat eats somethign that makes it sick,
it'll never eat it again.</p>
<p t="3195950" d="4870">But, if a rat smells the breath of a rat that
ate something that made it sick, he won't</p>
<p t="3200820" d="1000">eat that either.</p>
<p t="3201820" d="2049">Right, so rats eh.</p>
<p t="3203869" d="2000">Man, they can smell things.</p>
<p t="3205869" d="4021">And animals are built around a smell brain,
so they're a lot different than us.</p>
<p t="3209890" d="5180">We have - did I tell you about the t-shirt
study of symmetrical men?</p>
<p t="3215070" d="3549">Oh that's a funny one.</p>
<p t="3218619" d="5220">So we know that one of the things that signify
physical beauty is symmetry, and the reason</p>
<p t="3223839" d="6301">for that is that all things considered, symmetrical
people are more healthy than asymmetrical</p>
<p t="3230140" d="1000">people.</p>
<p t="3231140" d="4180">Asymmetry indicates taht somethings gone wrong
somewhere in the process of development.</p>
<p t="3235320" d="6080">So, we like symmetry and beauty.</p>
<p t="3241400" d="1000">And that's fine.</p>
<p t="3242400" d="1320">That's all the way across the animal kingdom.</p>
<p t="3243720" d="1000">So butterflies.</p>
<p t="3244720" d="3860">There are butterflies that wont mate with
another butterfly if it deviates from symmetry</p>
<p t="3248580" d="2100">some absurdly tiny amount.</p>
<p t="3250680" d="4300">Like really, it's micro measurement deviation.</p>
<p t="3254980" d="6010">I gues they have a butterfly template and
if you know, the potential mating butterfly</p>
<p t="3260990" d="2570">doesn't match, it's like flitter off.</p>
<p t="3263560" d="2600">You're not getting anywhere.</p>
<p t="3266160" d="2160">So, that's fine.</p>
<p t="3268320" d="1000">So symmetry.</p>
<p t="3269320" d="4670">This researcher, god only knows what possessed
him, took a bunch of men, ranging from symmetrical</p>
<p t="3273990" d="4619">to asymmetrical - judged by a panel - and
then he had them shower and then he had them</p>
<p t="3278609" d="2601">wear a t-shirt for like four hours.</p>
<p t="3281210" d="6170">And then, he gave these t-shirts to women
and he said okay rate the scent of the t-shirt</p>
<p t="3287380" d="3310">from positive to negative.</p>
<p t="3290690" d="2940">Well the women overwhelmingly preferred the
symmetrical guys.</p>
<p t="3293630" d="2240">Yeah, no kidding eh.</p>
<p t="3295870" d="4520">So you just bloody well never know what's
behind that attraction.</p>
<p t="3300390" d="1000">We know some things.</p>
<p t="3301390" d="2170">Symmetry's a big one, but there's a bunch
of other ones too.</p>
<p t="3303560" d="1000">I was just wondering how that would correlate
with - I know attraction to smells also has</p>
<p t="3304560" d="5490">to do with your optimal mate.</p>
<p t="3310050" d="8330">Oh yeah, there's a bunch of things.</p>
<p t="3318380" d="3450">Here's another study - this is a cool one.</p>
<p t="3321830" d="2670">This is one of the few psychological facts.</p>
<p t="3324500" d="2130">We don't have many psychological facts, you
know.</p>
<p t="3326630" d="5050">We have a lot of hypotheses about things but
this is as close to a fact as we've ever got.</p>
<p t="3331680" d="6260">So, back decades ago, these Israeli children
were raised in kibbutzim, and those were basically</p>
<p t="3337940" d="5840">- they were basically daycare for kids.</p>
<p t="3343780" d="1000">Group day care.</p>
<p t="3344780" d="4339">But the kids were more separated from the
parents than they might be in a regular day</p>
<p t="3349119" d="1000">care.</p>
<p t="3350119" d="4811">Anyways, all the Israeli kids were in these
kibbutzim, and so then we have detailed marriage</p>
<p t="3354930" d="2200">records of the kids.</p>
<p t="3357130" d="5400">You know that people very seldom marry their
siblings, and they're very seldomly in a sexual</p>
<p t="3362530" d="3210">relationship with their siblings, and you
might say well why is that.</p>
<p t="3365740" d="5750">It's the case across cultures, with very
specific exceptions like often high rank nobility</p>
<p t="3371490" d="3119">- they have an option.</p>
<p t="3374609" d="6211">Generally speaking, there's a powerful incest
taboo, as well as between parents and children.</p>
<p t="3380820" d="6300">So, some researcher decided well how do you
know who you're sibling is, you know roughly</p>
<p t="3387120" d="1000">speaking.</p>
<p t="3388120" d="4860">What exactly is it that's not turning you
on, let's say.</p>
<p t="3392980" d="4940">Well so they checked out the kibbutzim records
and they found that Israeli children who were</p>
<p t="3397920" d="4439">raised in the same kibbutzim never married
each other.</p>
<p t="3402359" d="7441">Whatever happened seemed to - it was as if
that close, close contact in the very early</p>
<p t="3409800" d="5950">years triggered whatever the sibling anti-response
is and that was that.</p>
<p t="3415750" d="1740">It's probably smell.</p>
<p t="3417490" d="1250">That would be my guess.</p>
<p t="3418740" d="4580">Now, there's also another study.</p>
<p t="3423320" d="6209">One of the things they found with mice - I
hope it's mice - is that mice will not mate</p>
<p t="3429529" d="1131">- is that right?</p>
<p t="3430660" d="4870">Okay, I'm gonna garble this up but it doesn't
matter because the underlying point is valid</p>
<p t="3435530" d="3410">even though I'm gonna mess up the details.</p>
<p t="3438940" d="5310">Animal studies indicated, if I remembered
correctly, that mice will not mate with other</p>
<p t="3444250" d="6520">mice who have an RH factor that would increase
the probability of a miscarriage.</p>
<p t="3450770" d="7059">And neither will women, well not with mice
obviously, but women do not like the smell</p>
<p t="3457829" d="7121">of men who have RH factors that in combination
with theirs will produce suboptimal offspring,</p>
<p t="3464950" d="5280">and when you ask them why they don't like
the smell, they say that it's like my brother.</p>
<p t="3470230" d="1210">Something like that.</p>
<p t="3471440" d="4040">So anyways, that's quite remarkable.</p>
<p t="3475480" d="4840">Now back to the rats and the expectancy model.</p>
<p t="3480320" d="6029">We already know that you can get an orienting
response out of a human being if something</p>
<p t="3486349" d="1121">deviates from expectancy.</p>
<p t="3487470" d="6050">Now people started studying this in rats,
and the original conceptualization was expectation.</p>
<p t="3493520" d="3970">So you have an expectation about how the world
is gonna lay itself out.</p>
<p t="3497490" d="5020">That's your model, and then if the world
deviates from that, you have an orienting</p>
<p t="3502510" d="4560">reflex and what that does is protect you from
predation.</p>
<p t="3507070" d="3120">That's the first level of the orienting
response.</p>
<p t="3510190" d="1639">It's really, really primitive.</p>
<p t="3511829" d="4171">It's mediated only by a few neuronal connections
so it's unbelievably rapid.</p>
<p t="3516000" d="5820">Then after that, there's anxiety and the
proclivity to explore.</p>
<p t="3521820" d="1140">That both gets activated.</p>
<p t="3522960" d="7619">So it's first protective, then you orient
towards the - imagine you're walking down</p>
<p t="3530579" d="2000">the street and hear a really loud noise behind
you.</p>
<p t="3532579" d="2411">It's like really loud, so it startles you.</p>
<p t="3534990" d="4310">Well you go into a crouch so that if a tiger
had jumped on your back, it would be hard</p>
<p t="3539300" d="6950">for it to get your neck, and then tenths of
a second later, you'll turn assuming you don't</p>
<p t="3546250" d="5450">get attacked by a tiger, you'll swivel and
turn and orient all your senses towards the</p>
<p t="3551700" d="6310">locale that was specified by the sound because
you have a stereo auditory system and you</p>
<p t="3558010" d="3630">can localize events in space using that.</p>
<p t="3561640" d="2280">So you orient towards it - that's part of
the orienting reflex.</p>
<p t="3563920" d="1310">It's a reflex.</p>
<p t="3565230" d="1230">It's not voluntary.</p>
<p t="3566460" d="5710">So, and then once you've got your eyes trained
on it, and your ears, then you start to explore</p>
<p t="3572170" d="4060">it and then you might freeze.</p>
<p t="3576230" d="3360">You might get out of there which is a panic
response.</p>
<p t="3579590" d="2850">That's another thing that could be triggered
by the orienting reflex.</p>
<p t="3582440" d="1000">Different circuit.</p>
<p t="3583440" d="1900">Or you might think, “Wow, what's going
on over there?</p>
<p t="3585340" d="1450">It looks interesting.”</p>
<p t="3586790" d="1680">And then you go approach it.</p>
<p t="3588470" d="7240">Now, those two - the exploratory part is mediated
in part by the hypothalamus which is a very</p>
<p t="3595710" d="5800">very old system, and it has a whole section,
about half of it is devoted to the circuitry</p>
<p t="3601510" d="3810">that you would use to figure out what was
going on if something that you didn't understood</p>
<p t="3605320" d="1000">happened.</p>
<p t="3606320" d="4340">And then you have a whole other circuit that's
hippocampal and amygdalic that regulates the</p>
<p t="3610660" d="4300">exploratory circuit and says be careful because
while you're gathering information, you might</p>
<p t="3614960" d="6790">get killed and the anxiety circuit takes primacy,
generally speaking, over the exploratory circuit.</p>
<p t="3621750" d="5170">And the reason for that is you don't want
to get information and be dead so caution</p>
<p t="3626920" d="1170">is the watchword.</p>
<p t="3628090" d="4749">Now, the other thing you might think about
which is an extremely useful thing to think</p>
<p t="3632839" d="1111">about.</p>
<p t="3633950" d="2870">Okay let's go back to that diagram I showed
you with the hierarchy.</p>
<p t="3636820" d="4540">Right, so you've got the motor actions at
the bottom, and you've got the high level</p>
<p t="3641360" d="1740">abstractions at the top.</p>
<p t="3643100" d="5820">So, you're tickling the baby and somebody
comes home and says if you tickle the baby</p>
<p t="3648920" d="2449">this way, the baby has more fun.</p>
<p t="3651369" d="2291">And so how do you respond to that?</p>
<p t="3653660" d="2950">Well maybe you're a little peeved because
you're doing perfectly fine with this baby</p>
<p t="3656610" d="6270">and someone's coming and altering your tickling
micro personality, and you know, if you're</p>
<p t="3662880" d="3270">irritable you'll say well why don't you
just go off and find a baby of your own to</p>
<p t="3666150" d="2300">play with.</p>
<p t="3668450" d="4680">And if you're not that irritable, you might
say well okay show me what to do.</p>
<p t="3673130" d="3780">There'll be a tinge of negative emotion
there, generally speaking, depending on how</p>
<p t="3676910" d="6270">the person has approached you but your self
concept can probably handle a micro change</p>
<p t="3683180" d="2110">to your tickling routine.</p>
<p t="3685290" d="5309">Okay, so that's gonna produce only a little
bit of anxiety and irritation and the reason</p>
<p t="3690599" d="9730">for that is that the threat to you is proportionate
to the magnitude of the system that's being</p>
<p t="3700329" d="3081">modified by the challenge.</p>
<p t="3703410" d="4650">Now this is really useful to know, okay, practically,
and this is why.</p>
<p t="3708060" d="6600">Let's say you're having an argument with
your partner and you say, you're a stupid</p>
<p t="3714660" d="5500">person and you've always been a stupid person
and as far as I can tell, as far into the</p>
<p t="3720160" d="4100">future as I can see, you're going to remain
a stupid person.</p>
<p t="3724260" d="1079">So what are they supposed to do?</p>
<p t="3725339" d="2601">What are they gonna do when you say that?</p>
<p t="3727940" d="3790">They're gonna cry like if you mean it.</p>
<p t="3731730" d="5241">They're gonna get angry if you mean it, and
they'll not like you very much, and why</p>
<p t="3736971" d="1000">is that?</p>
<p t="3737971" d="3209">Well it's like, it's assault basically.</p>
<p t="3741180" d="7110">The only thing you can do in a situation like
that is walk away, ignore it, respond in kind,</p>
<p t="3748290" d="2200">or it degenerates into violence.</p>
<p t="3750490" d="2810">That's it because there's no discussion.</p>
<p t="3753300" d="1660">You haven't left the person anywhere to go.</p>
<p t="3754960" d="5030">You've gone right to the top of their hierarchy
and said everything about you is wrong, and</p>
<p t="3759990" d="5000">worse than that, all the mechanisms that we
could use to correct it won't work.</p>
<p t="3764990" d="1910">So, those are fighting words.</p>
<p t="3766900" d="2130">So don't do that unless you want to have
a fight.</p>
<p t="3769030" d="2290">So then you might say, well what would you
do instead?</p>
<p t="3771320" d="5340">And the answer is deliver the least amount
of information you possibly can, and so let's</p>
<p t="3776660" d="5179">say you come home and your person is watching
TV, and you were kind of hoping they'd greet</p>
<p t="3781839" d="1811">you at the door.</p>
<p t="3783650" d="3240">You shouldn't break down into tears and say
you're a stupid person, you've always</p>
<p t="3786890" d="2910">been a stupid person, and you're gonna be
a stupid person in the future.</p>
<p t="3789800" d="7220">You should say, I have this peculiarity and
that is when I come home, I don't have enough</p>
<p t="3797020" d="2839">confidence to just be happy.</p>
<p t="3799859" d="4510">I would like you to come and say - just shut
the TV off for two minutes, come to the front</p>
<p t="3804369" d="3911">door and say “Hello”, and then you can
go back and watch your TV.</p>
<p t="3808280" d="1789">Would it be okay if you did that?</p>
<p t="3810069" d="5931">And they'll think, “Okay you'll have to
pay for it somehow,” but then they'll probably</p>
<p t="3816000" d="1510">do it.</p>
<p t="3817510" d="4620">But the thing is you've got to specify the
routine that you want transformed at the highest</p>
<p t="3822130" d="6040">possible level of resolution, and you want
to recommend the minimal necessary change</p>
<p t="3828170" d="2189">that will satisfy you.</p>
<p t="3830359" d="5691">So you can't say, “If you love me, you'd
know how to greet me at the door.”</p>
<p t="3836050" d="1000">Ha.</p>
<p t="3837050" d="1410">Not helpful because they're stupid.</p>
<p t="3838460" d="3100">Right, and so are you.</p>
<p t="3841560" d="1529">So you have to spell it out.</p>
<p t="3843089" d="1111">It's like what do you want.</p>
<p t="3844200" d="5680">Exactly, what would make you satisfied, and
then you have to have your person grudgingly</p>
<p t="3849880" d="5420">practice that a few times and you have to
let them do it very badly and also in a bad</p>
<p t="3855300" d="4610">temper, and then you'd have to reward them
for it and then maybe three months later,</p>
<p t="3859910" d="1919">they'll do it properly.</p>
<p t="3861829" d="2731">So you need to know that because that's what
people are like.</p>
<p t="3864560" d="3380">It's very hard for them to learn new things,
and they're very resistant to it, but they're</p>
<p t="3867940" d="2700">very responsive to reward.</p>
<p t="3870640" d="4620">So another thing - this is partly what B.F.
Skinner figured out so, when he was training</p>
<p t="3875260" d="4520">rats and he wanted a rat to do something,
one of the things he would do is put - maybe</p>
<p t="3879780" d="6030">he was gonna train the rat to climb up a little
ladder, and I mean he can get rats to climb</p>
<p t="3885810" d="3720">ladders and climb across the little monkey
bars and then spin around three times and</p>
<p t="3889530" d="4360">then, you know, whack a ball and then eat
something, like he got incredibly complex</p>
<p t="3893890" d="1540">behavior out of rats.</p>
<p t="3895430" d="2639">And the way he did that was patience.</p>
<p t="3898069" d="4371">So he put the ladder in the cage, and the
rat would just run around doing rat things,</p>
<p t="3902440" d="8240">and it would put its hand on the first rung,
and Skinner would give it a pellet, and so</p>
<p t="3910680" d="5679">after even once, the rat's gonna be like
standing in the immediate vicinity of the</p>
<p t="3916359" d="4001">ladder and then the frequency with which its
gonna go like this has just increased so its</p>
<p t="3920360" d="1000">gonna do it again.</p>
<p t="3921360" d="1000">Bang, pellet.</p>
<p t="3922360" d="2999">Well soon the rat's just going like this,
right?</p>
<p t="3925359" d="3151">So then, you wait until the rat tries the
other hand.</p>
<p t="3928510" d="1359">So you give it a pellet then.</p>
<p t="3929869" d="3331">Well then it's going like this and then
because it's going to get bored, it'll</p>
<p t="3933200" d="1000">go like this.</p>
<p t="3934200" d="1000">It'll hit the next stair.</p>
<p t="3935200" d="1000">Bang, you give it a pellet.</p>
<p t="3936200" d="3380">Soon the rat is climbing and doing all the
little things he wanted to do.</p>
<p t="3939580" d="2680">Now the problem with that is you have to be
patient.</p>
<p t="3942260" d="2470">You have to wait until the rat does what you
want.</p>
<p t="3944730" d="2180">Okay that's more relationship advice.</p>
<p t="3946910" d="6480">Wait till the rat does what you want, and
then reward it, and it's unbelievably useful.</p>
<p t="3953390" d="2420">It's also extraordinarily positive.</p>
<p t="3955810" d="7039">I mean I'm being, you know, comical, insofar
as I can manage that, about the situation,</p>
<p t="3962849" d="4151">but people love reward and they love attention.</p>
<p t="3967000" d="5420">People love attention more than anything else,
and so if you watch through the day, and when</p>
<p t="3972420" d="5000">your partner does something that's good,
say “Bam, that was good” or something</p>
<p t="3977420" d="1000">like that.</p>
<p t="3978420" d="4280">You can be inventive, and then they'll do
it more, and if you do that a whole bunch</p>
<p t="3982700" d="4760">like for a year, they'll be doing things that
are good for you just all the time.</p>
<p t="3987460" d="5800">But you have to be patient, which is very
annoying and you have to suppress your response</p>
<p t="3993260" d="5190">to only respond to negative things, you know,
because what we know about the expectancy</p>
<p t="3998450" d="7760">models is that a deviation from expectation
produces a burst of negative emotion.</p>
<p t="4006210" d="6430">So you come home, and the whole house is clean,
but there's like - I don't know - the</p>
<p t="4012640" d="2960">dog has shed on the rug or something and the
person overlooked that.</p>
<p t="4015600" d="3390">It's like you're not gonna see the clean
house, you're gonna see the rug with the</p>
<p t="4018990" d="3680">dog fur on it and you're gonna say “Why
didn't you clean up the rug with the dog fur?”</p>
<p t="4022670" d="3830">And they're gonna say, “Good luck getting
me to clean the house again.”</p>
<p t="4026500" d="6170">And you know, because the thing is the exception
stands out and what's done doesn't, and</p>
<p t="4032670" d="3020">the reason for that is you can just ignore
what's done because it's done.</p>
<p t="4035690" d="1200">It doesn't get in your way.</p>
<p t="4036890" d="2280">So it just gets invisible really quickly.</p>
<p t="4039170" d="3340">So you really gotta watch that tendency.</p>
<p t="4042510" d="3830">One of the things Nietzsche said was that
if you really want to punish someone, you</p>
<p t="4046340" d="3941">don't punish them when they do something wrong
because they expect that.</p>
<p t="4050281" d="1979">That's not a punishment, they expect that.</p>
<p t="4052260" d="2550">They might even be relieved by it.</p>
<p t="4054810" d="4680">You want to punish them when they do something
right because then you'll really hurt them.</p>
<p t="4059490" d="3200">So that's something to think about, if you're
in a relationship man.</p>
<p t="4062690" d="4130">If someone's done something right, do not
punish them.</p>
<p t="4066820" d="2039">You do that two or three times and that's
it man.</p>
<p t="4068859" d="3131">You're not gonna get them to do that anymore.</p>
<p t="4071990" d="2520">So, judiciousness.</p>
<p t="4074510" d="1000">Watch what they're doing.</p>
<p t="4075510" d="4250">If something happens that's good, notice
it, and you know, if they've done a bunch</p>
<p t="4079760" d="2930">of things don't concentrate on the things
they did wrong.</p>
<p t="4082690" d="1760">That's not smart.</p>
<p t="4084450" d="2520">It's really hard on them too.</p>
<p t="4086970" d="4460">In some sense this sounds manipulative and
selfish, you know, because I'm teaching</p>
<p t="4091430" d="6639">you how to train your partner, but you should
also teach them how to train you because it</p>
<p t="4098069" d="2951">would be really nice if you could come home
and the person would say, “Well what did</p>
<p t="4101020" d="3599">you do today?” and you say “Here's a
bunch of things I did.” and they say “Well</p>
<p t="4104619" d="3071">this looks really good, and that was great,
and why don't you do some more of that?”</p>
<p t="4107690" d="4219">And you're like “Oh boy,” it was a great
day.</p>
<p t="4111909" d="5410">So, you can train them to train you properly,
and that's a really helpful thing especially</p>
<p t="4117319" d="2800">when you do it over a few years.</p>
<p t="4120119" d="3200">That's how you have a good relationship because
you're both clueless as hell to begin with.</p>
<p t="4123319" d="4870">You don't know even what would make you
happy, much less what would make the other</p>
<p t="4128189" d="5240">person happy and so you've got to figure these
things out bit by bit and you have to inform</p>
<p t="4133429" d="5760">each other, and you have to be patient enough
to let your partner do these things really</p>
<p t="4139189" d="1000">badly.</p>
<p t="4140189" d="2640">I'll give you another example.</p>
<p t="4142829" d="5350">Sometimes I see couples sporadically in my
clinical practice.</p>
<p t="4148179" d="7120">I'm not a couples counsellor, but sometimes
when I'm working with someone, there's an</p>
<p t="4155299" d="4340">issue that needs to be discussed with both
people because otherwise it's just stupid,</p>
<p t="4159639" d="5960">and one of the things I often recommend to
people especially once they have kids is that</p>
<p t="4165599" d="5840">they set aside - to use an anachronistic phrase
- date nights.</p>
<p t="4171439" d="2570">Well, everyone hates that idea.</p>
<p t="4174009" d="4230">They say, well you know, they'll just say,
“I'm not doing that.”</p>
<p t="4178239" d="1000">That'd be one objection.</p>
<p t="4179239" d="1600">“We're just not doing that.</p>
<p t="4180839" d="4740">That's what we did before we got married.”</p>
<p t="4185579" d="2510">They'll say, “Well my partner will never
go for that.”</p>
<p t="4188089" d="5820">They've got a bunch of excuses why that isn't
going to work, and so I've heard all those</p>
<p t="4193909" d="1000">excuses.</p>
<p t="4194909" d="3641">I've heard all of them, and then maybe I
convince them, “Yeah, yeah, I know this</p>
<p t="4198550" d="1000">is stupid.</p>
<p t="4199550" d="1000">It's awkward.</p>
<p t="4200550" d="1000">It's artificial.</p>
<p t="4201550" d="1000">That's okay.</p>
<p t="4202550" d="2350">Just try it once.”</p>
<p t="4204900" d="3150">So then they'll go and try it, and then they'll
come back and say, “We had an absolutely</p>
<p t="4208050" d="1089">miserable time.</p>
<p t="4209139" d="1000">Really.</p>
<p t="4210139" d="1000">We had a miserable time.</p>
<p t="4211139" d="4011">We couldn't agree on what movie to go to,
and then she took me to her movie and I really</p>
<p t="4215150" d="1589">didn't like it and so we fought all the way
home.</p>
<p t="4216739" d="2311">We're never doing that again.”</p>
<p t="4219050" d="4299">And I say, well really, you've got thirty
years, four hundred days.</p>
<p t="4223349" d="1290">That's twelve thousand days.</p>
<p t="4224639" d="1741">Okay, so you're not going to do that.</p>
<p t="4226380" d="6239">You're going to spend the next twelve thousand
days without having any real romantic evenings</p>
<p t="4232619" d="1810">and interactions with your spouse.</p>
<p t="4234429" d="1000">That's your plan.</p>
<p t="4235429" d="3770">And I like doing arithmetic with my clients.</p>
<p t="4239199" d="1320">They hate that.</p>
<p t="4240519" d="1330">They hate arithmetic.</p>
<p t="4241849" d="3611">It's like well no that sounds like a bad
idea.</p>
<p t="4245460" d="3869">Okay well would you like some romance in your
life or are you just done with that?</p>
<p t="4249329" d="4890">Well really, like people can go for a long
time with no romance at all.</p>
<p t="4254219" d="2931">They say, “Well no maybe, we'd like some
of that.”</p>
<p t="4257150" d="1380">Well how much?</p>
<p t="4258530" d="1160">Once a year.</p>
<p t="4259690" d="1430">Well, no.</p>
<p t="4261120" d="1369">Once a month.</p>
<p t="4262489" d="2061">Well, no.</p>
<p t="4264550" d="1140">Once every two weeks.</p>
<p t="4265690" d="1779">Well, sometimes people are really busy.</p>
<p t="4267469" d="3190">Okay, that beats the hell out of zero.</p>
<p t="4270659" d="1531">Once a week, twice a week.</p>
<p t="4272190" d="2789">Okay, whatever, we're gonna start with a
range.</p>
<p t="4274979" d="2301">Okay, what would a good evening look like?</p>
<p t="4277280" d="5009">Like if you could both get exactly what you
wanted, what would it look like?</p>
<p t="4282289" d="4660">Then they have to think about that because
the previous theory was, “My stupid partner</p>
<p t="4286949" d="3190">should know what I like” and that's what
the partner is thinking too.</p>
<p t="4290139" d="3801">It's like good luck with that, no they don't
have a clue especially if they're men.</p>
<p t="4293940" d="5009">They don't have a clue so you have to tell
them what you want and how they could deliver</p>
<p t="4298949" d="3190">it, and vice versa which is very awkward and
horrible.</p>
<p t="4302139" d="4400">And then you have to practice it for six months
because you know, it takes a lot of practice</p>
<p t="4306539" d="4591">to do something sophisticated really well,
and then if you do that it's like poof,</p>
<p t="4311130" d="2230">you got it for the rest of your life.</p>
<p t="4313360" d="5000">So it's worth the aggravation, and you know
the first time the rat puts its paw on the</p>
<p t="4318360" d="3339">ladder, its just sort of doing it accidentally.</p>
<p t="4321699" d="5311">You can't expect it to do it well, and that's
exactly how to view your own progress and</p>
<p t="4327010" d="1009">the progress of your partner.</p>
<p t="4328019" d="2821">It's like let them do it badly for awhile.</p>
<p t="4330840" d="1849">At least they're doing it.</p>
<p t="4332689" d="3841">So if you think they should do it faster,
well look real hard and see how easy it is</p>
<p t="4336530" d="4009">to change your own behavior because it's
really hard to change your own behavior.</p>
<p t="4340539" d="2361">Everybody says, “I'm going to exercise
three times a week.”</p>
<p t="4342900" d="1799">New Years, and its like no one does.</p>
<p t="4344699" d="4610">They buy the membership and then they feel
guilty for having them, but they don't actually</p>
<p t="4349309" d="5201">go to the gym - and that's a perfect example
of how difficult it is to transform behavior.</p>
<p t="4354510" d="5410">Okay, so back to the diagram here.</p>
<p t="4359920" d="2319">Expectation.</p>
<p t="4362239" d="7050">So, the early models of expectation were cognitive
models and the idea was the rat makes a little</p>
<p t="4369289" d="5430">model of the world, and then he operates in
that world according to what he expects.</p>
<p t="4374719" d="1811">Now there's a problem with that model.</p>
<p t="4376530" d="1000">There's a bunch of them.</p>
<p t="4377530" d="4200">The first is now we know that animals don't
make comprehensive models of the world, and</p>
<p t="4381730" d="1550">that's a huge problem.</p>
<p t="4383280" d="2620">The problem is, well what do they get rid
of, and how?</p>
<p t="4385900" d="4639">But the way you get rid of that problem is
that you introduce motivation into the equation,</p>
<p t="4390539" d="4741">and it's interesting because the behaviorists
always thought of animals like blank slates</p>
<p t="4395280" d="5390">so they never really took motivation seriously
as a contributor to cognitive modeling.</p>
<p t="4400670" d="6460">It's also the case that probably ever since
the Enlightenment, people have thought of</p>
<p t="4407130" d="3650">emotion and motivation as forces opposed to
rationality.</p>
<p t="4410780" d="4680">So you know, you're as rational insofar as
you didn't let your emotions and motivations</p>
<p t="4415460" d="1210">influence you.</p>
<p t="4416670" d="2000">But that's a foolish theory.</p>
<p t="4418670" d="4520">There are times when it's inappropriate
for certain purposes to let certain motivations</p>
<p t="4423190" d="6279">interfere with your observations, but generally
speaking you never think about anything without</p>
<p t="4429469" d="2111">being motivated because why would you?</p>
<p t="4431580" d="3579">Like, there's a trillion things you can
think of and you're not gonna think of most</p>
<p t="4435159" d="1000">of them.</p>
<p t="4436159" d="3761">You have to have a reason to think of them,
and the reason is that, well, all the time</p>
<p t="4439920" d="4480">you're operating in some sort of motivational
structure, and you can sort of model them</p>
<p t="4444400" d="5650">using the same kind of hierarchy that we use
to model the personality as such.</p>
<p t="4450050" d="6370">I'll give you an example.</p>
<p t="4456420" d="4719">So let's think of some basic motivations
and emotions.</p>
<p t="4461139" d="4451">Those aren't good categories by the way because
there's no such things as motivations and</p>
<p t="4465590" d="2270">there's no such thing as emotions.</p>
<p t="4467860" d="5799">The things we loosely categorize into motivations
and emotions each have their own brain circuitry,</p>
<p t="4473659" d="3411">and so there are similarities between them
and there are differences.</p>
<p t="4477070" d="1000">They're not clean categories.</p>
<p t="4478070" d="4549">Well, we're gonna use the terminology anyways
because we don't have a better one.</p>
<p t="4482619" d="7620">For my purposes, you can roughly define a
motivation as opposed to an emotion as a motivation</p>
<p t="4490239" d="4880">is really something that establishes, you
could say, a goal, but it doesn't.</p>
<p t="4495119" d="1411">It establishes one of these.</p>
<p t="4496530" d="4419">It doesn't establish a goal, and it doesn't
drive behavior.</p>
<p t="4500949" d="2601">So what it does is let's say you're hungry
and it's nighttime, and you want to have</p>
<p t="4503550" d="1000">a peanut butter sandwich.</p>
<p t="4504550" d="6109">So imagine you're sitting there typing away,
and all of a sudden this little image of having</p>
<p t="4510659" d="1681">something to eat creeps into your head.</p>
<p t="4512340" d="1710">It's not usually quite specific.</p>
<p t="4514050" d="2319">It's that there's something you would like
to eat.</p>
<p t="4516369" d="3020">So you think, “Ah, I could really use some
popcorn.”</p>
<p t="4519389" d="6051">So you're typing away and the stupid popcorn
thing keeps popping up, and finally your whole</p>
<p t="4525440" d="3449">body is starting to get into the popcorn and
you think “Oh to hell with it, I'll go</p>
<p t="4528889" d="1340">make some popcorn.”</p>
<p t="4530229" d="5591">So what's happened is that your hypothalamus,
roughly speaking, is monitoring your internal</p>
<p t="4535820" d="3950">body state and it thinks that you need some
- maybe you need some salt, but maybe you</p>
<p t="4539770" d="5320">need some food, and so it's gonna start
popping up, not a drive.</p>
<p t="4545090" d="5310">It's not like all of a sudden you're a
robot, like a popcorn seeking robot and you're</p>
<p t="4550400" d="6630">laying out your chained together condition
popcorn making and eating routines.</p>
<p t="4557030" d="2359">That isn't what happens.</p>
<p t="4559389" d="5550">What happens instead that you start to envision
a new state of being, and that state of being</p>
<p t="4564939" d="4981">has a goal which is you eating some popcorn,
and it has you where you are which is in an</p>
<p t="4569920" d="7779">insufficient state of popcorn and then what's
happening as well is that the motor processes</p>
<p t="4577699" d="4090">that you would use to implement that are also
disinhibited.</p>
<p t="4581789" d="1000">They're there.</p>
<p t="4582789" d="2060">You already know how to do it.</p>
<p t="4584849" d="3620">They get disinhibited or you can think of
them as getting primed.</p>
<p t="4588469" d="1000">They're not.</p>
<p t="4589469" d="2101">They're getting disinhibited, but you can
think of them as getting primed.</p>
<p t="4591570" d="6049">And at some point, that becomes overwhelming
enough - say, pressure from the hypothalamus</p>
<p t="4597619" d="1971">which is really what's bloody well in control.</p>
<p t="4599590" d="3069">It says yeah, yeah, enough internet surfing.</p>
<p t="4602659" d="3590">Off to the popcorn, and so you leap up and
then what do you do?</p>
<p t="4606249" d="2970">You reorient the way you're looking at the
world.</p>
<p t="4609219" d="5141">Everything in the world becomes low resolution,
or even zero except those few things that</p>
<p t="4614360" d="2379">are relevant to your new quest.</p>
<p t="4616739" d="1210">Down the stairs you go.</p>
<p t="4617949" d="4761">You find the right pan; you find the popcorn,
getting irritated if you can't find it, right,</p>
<p t="4622710" d="5460">because - now you see it's interesting because
your emotions align along your goals.</p>
<p t="4628170" d="5639">As long as you're pursuing a beeline to your
goal, and everything's laying itself out not</p>
<p t="4633809" d="6091">as you'd expect, but as you want, then your
emotions stay positive but as soon as something</p>
<p t="4639900" d="4529">deviates then you're irritated, and the reason
for that is like let's say you can't find</p>
<p t="4644429" d="1250">a popcorn pan.</p>
<p t="4645679" d="3770">Well your brain is computing, well something
like this.</p>
<p t="4649449" d="6641">This is obviously not how it works, but it's
an - x amount of energy and matter from popcorn</p>
<p t="4656090" d="1899">means it has x value.</p>
<p t="4657989" d="7480">If you expend a whole bunch of energy running
around in your clueless state trying to acquire</p>
<p t="4665469" d="3500">popcorn, you can easily get to the point where
you've expended more energy and time than</p>
<p t="4668969" d="1681">the popcorn delivers.</p>
<p t="4670650" d="2500">And if you do that for a month, then you die.</p>
<p t="4673150" d="5730">So it's perfectly reasonable for you to
get irritated when the path length to your</p>
<p t="4678880" d="4859">destination increases radically, and you might
get even more irritated if you can't find</p>
<p t="4683739" d="5181">any popcorn, and it's like oh no I have
to dispense with the popcorn micro personality</p>
<p t="4688920" d="2940">and it's all irritated because it's sort
of alive.</p>
<p t="4691860" d="3520">It's irritated you have to squash it, and
then you have to come up with well maybe I</p>
<p t="4695380" d="1449">can have a peanut butter sandwich.</p>
<p t="4696829" d="5991">And then pop, up comes a new micro personality
that orients itself towards the goal, and</p>
<p t="4702820" d="4009">so all the time you're doing that, you're
always in a motivated state.</p>
<p t="4706829" d="6971">Now, it's not a drive because it's not
deterministic, but it does have a behavioral</p>
<p t="4713800" d="1000">element.</p>
<p t="4714800" d="2740">You have all these Piagetian subroutines.</p>
<p t="4717540" d="5749">They're stored in your body, you know, all
your body capacity or your skills.</p>
<p t="4723289" d="4961">And you know which set of those you're likely
to use if you're going to do x thing.</p>
<p t="4728250" d="5739">So those get prepared, and then your perceptions
reorient towards the new goal.</p>
<p t="4733989" d="1740">It's like a hunting goal.</p>
<p t="4735729" d="3921">You're fixated on it, and then your emotions
orient along that so as long as things are</p>
<p t="4739650" d="1920">going well, you're happy.</p>
<p t="4741570" d="1129">You're hopeful.</p>
<p t="4742699" d="1000">Things are proceeding.</p>
<p t="4743699" d="4070">That's positive emotion; that's dopaminergically
mediated, and if things aren't going well</p>
<p t="4747769" d="4271">it's either, well, it's any amount of
negative emotion from mild irritation to full</p>
<p t="4752040" d="1760">blown temper tantrum.</p>
<p t="4753800" d="5889">So that's - and you're - okay that's
the simple story.</p>
<p t="4759689" d="5720">The complex story is okay, you're hungry,
you're thirsty, you're tired, you're</p>
<p t="4765409" d="1670">hot, you're lonely.</p>
<p t="4767079" d="1000">You need to play.</p>
<p t="4768079" d="4611">Okay, so let's say you've got, for the sake
of argument, let's say you have eight fundamental</p>
<p t="4772690" d="2099">motivational systems.</p>
<p t="4774789" d="1910">Now, who cares how many.</p>
<p t="4776699" d="1000">It's a finite set.</p>
<p t="4777699" d="1170">It's under twenty.</p>
<p t="4778869" d="1730">Depends on whether you include anger.</p>
<p t="4780599" d="1781">Is anger motivation or emotion?</p>
<p t="4782380" d="1900">Is pain motivation or emotion?</p>
<p t="4784280" d="4250">We don't care because they're not formal
categories.</p>
<p t="4788530" d="8739">So anyways, there's a set number of them and
then so they have to run to satiation.</p>
<p t="4797269" d="4741">So what satiation means is they set up an
end state; you perform the routines, you achieve</p>
<p t="4802010" d="2540">the end state, and the system shuts down.</p>
<p t="4804550" d="1290">It's satiated.</p>
<p t="4805840" d="4770">Now you'll experience that as satisfaction,
not as pleasure.</p>
<p t="4810610" d="2219">And you'll think well what's the difference?</p>
<p t="4812829" d="1750">It's tight.</p>
<p t="4814579" d="4011">It's complicated, but it's important.</p>
<p t="4818590" d="5949">The kind of positive emotion that people really
like is associated with search and the hope,</p>
<p t="4824539" d="4620">not with the acquiry because what happens
when you acquire is well you're no longer</p>
<p t="4829159" d="6900">in this state which has an impulse to action
in it, but that's exciting.</p>
<p t="4836059" d="1000">That's fun.</p>
<p t="4837059" d="1000">You're on the track of something.</p>
<p t="4838059" d="2491">It's like you're alive while you're searching
for something.</p>
<p t="4840550" d="1000">Well then you find it.</p>
<p t="4841550" d="3449">It's like good, you need to find it, but
then the whole thing disappears and you're</p>
<p t="4844999" d="3041">sitting there thinking well I've just graduated.</p>
<p t="4848040" d="1000">Now what?</p>
<p t="4849040" d="2050">Right, because that's what'll happen when
you graduate.</p>
<p t="4851090" d="1579">It's like hey you're a student.</p>
<p t="4852669" d="1561">You've got status.</p>
<p t="4854230" d="2989">You've got a hierarchy of values.</p>
<p t="4857219" d="4641">You've got a way of orienting yourself in
the world, and you have an identity.</p>
<p t="4861860" d="3270">So you're in there, and everyone's happy about
it and so one day you graduate.</p>
<p t="4865130" d="1529">It's like success.</p>
<p t="4866659" d="4590">Well really, it's like poof that's gone,
and the next thing you know, you're like</p>
<p t="4871249" d="2551">handing out coffee at the local Starbucks.</p>
<p t="4873800" d="2280">Yeah, well you get the point.</p>
<p t="4876080" d="1289">You've experienced this all the time in your
life.</p>
<p t="4877369" d="1580">You hit a pinnacle.</p>
<p t="4878949" d="5701">You've obtained something, but the problem
is that now what?</p>
<p t="4884650" d="2469">You have to conjure up a whole new you.</p>
<p t="4887119" d="4480">So some of it is satisfying, you've accomplished
a goal, but some of it's just a big pain</p>
<p t="4891599" d="1000">in the neck.</p>
<p t="4892599" d="5701">It's like uh oh, student me has disappeared
and now it's frantically searching for employment</p>
<p t="4898300" d="6569">me, and that me doesn't have the status, and
is in a space of much more radical uncertainty.</p>
<p t="4904869" d="7580">So don't be thinking that getting to where
you want to go is what you want.</p>
<p t="4912449" d="3730">What you want is to bloody well make sure
that the voyage is worth it.</p>
<p t="4916179" d="6500">Now it's very interesting because people
are really wired up this way, and I think</p>
<p t="4922679" d="3141">it's because we're so radically exploratory.</p>
<p t="4925820" d="8449">So, when you're proceeding towards a valued
goal, let's call that a cue that goal attainment</p>
<p t="4934269" d="1390">is about to occur.</p>
<p t="4935659" d="1851">It's going to occur in some chain.</p>
<p t="4937510" d="3750">A leads to B, B leads to C, C leads to D,
and so on.</p>
<p t="4941260" d="2439">You're like a hound on a trail.</p>
<p t="4943699" d="1960">It's positive, like yeah this is working.</p>
<p t="4945659" d="1000">Yeah, this is working.</p>
<p t="4946659" d="1000">Yeah, this is working.</p>
<p t="4947659" d="1000">That's positive.</p>
<p t="4948659" d="3451">It's moving you ahead, and that's really
where you experience a lot of your positive</p>
<p t="4952110" d="1000">emotion.</p>
<p t="4953110" d="1000">That's dopaminergically mediated.</p>
<p t="4954110" d="4879">That's the system you kick with cocaine
or any of the other drugs of abuse that people</p>
<p t="4958989" d="3061">use that don't quell anxiety.</p>
<p t="4962050" d="4439">It's a very, very desirable motivational
state.</p>
<p t="4966489" d="7550">I read awhile back somebody who said you can
buy anything but you can't buy wanting anything,</p>
<p t="4974039" d="5870">and that's a staggeringly interesting comment
because you think well, is wanting a positive</p>
<p t="4979909" d="1000">state?</p>
<p t="4980909" d="4250">Well you don't have it, so that's kind of
annoying and you think, “No I don't want</p>
<p t="4985159" d="1000">to want things.</p>
<p t="4986159" d="1000">I want to have them.”</p>
<p t="4987159" d="3091">It's like yeah, don't be so sure about
that.</p>
<p t="4990250" d="3280">So one of the things, one of the ways people
have figured out how to deal with that is</p>
<p t="4993530" d="4810">they decide they want something that they
can't get and that's actually extraordinarily</p>
<p t="4998340" d="2089">smart, and it's a deep archetypal idea.</p>
<p t="5000429" d="1241">Here's an example.</p>
<p t="5001670" d="2670">You've seen Pinocchio, right?</p>
<p t="5004340" d="3280">Okay, so Pinocchio is about a puppet, a marionette.</p>
<p t="5007620" d="2890">So that means someone else is pulling his
strings.</p>
<p t="5010510" d="1000">Right?</p>
<p t="5011510" d="1049">We don't know who.</p>
<p t="5012559" d="2360">Sometimes it's virtually Satan himself.</p>
<p t="5014919" d="2740">Remember the Stromboli?</p>
<p t="5017659" d="3330">There's another character just after him is
the coachman.</p>
<p t="5020989" d="5840">The coachman, he's like king of the thieves
and he ends up pulling Pinocchio's strings.</p>
<p t="5026829" d="5681">So there's one scene in the Disney movie
where the coachman reveals himself and he's</p>
<p t="5032510" d="4899">completely red, he has really big teeth; he's
a satanic figure, and he scares the fox and</p>
<p t="5037409" d="4310">the cat who are like low level criminals who
think they're bad, but you know, have never</p>
<p t="5041719" d="1000">really met bad.</p>
<p t="5042719" d="4570">He just scares them right into the corner,
and so it's all of a sudden this person</p>
<p t="5047289" d="4551">reveals the archetype behind and just closes
back down pulling Pinocchio's strings.</p>
<p t="5051840" d="1159">Okay, now.</p>
<p t="5052999" d="1551">He's a marionette.</p>
<p t="5054550" d="4419">Well, the first question that arises is who's
pulling your strings?</p>
<p t="5058969" d="1891">And that's a really good question.</p>
<p t="5060860" d="4469">One of the things Jung said was “People
don't have ideas, ideas have people.”</p>
<p t="5065329" d="4900">You know, you can think about that for about
three months and it should make you afraid</p>
<p t="5070229" d="6790">the whole time because as soon as you get
that, you think uh oh.</p>
<p t="5077019" d="5191">Let's say you're an ideologue of some sort
because some of you probably are: socialist,</p>
<p t="5082210" d="3600">fascist, environmentalist, something that
has -ist on the end.</p>
<p t="5085810" d="2869">It's like you think those are your ideas.</p>
<p t="5088679" d="1840">They're not.</p>
<p t="5090519" d="2381">You're their tools and that's fine.</p>
<p t="5092900" d="5139">If you want to be a tool of those ideas, you
go right ahead, but you don't know where those</p>
<p t="5098039" d="3710">ideas are leading and they could well be leading
somewhere you do not want to go.</p>
<p t="5101749" d="4841">Now the plus side is you don't have to take
responsibility for it because you're just</p>
<p t="5106590" d="2000">drifting in an ocean of thought.</p>
<p t="5108590" d="4060">But one of the things that I learned from
Jung was you should figure out just exactly</p>
<p t="5112650" d="4900">which ideas are possessing you and then you
should decide if those are your ideas, and</p>
<p t="5117550" d="1910">the probability that they are is zero.</p>
<p t="5119460" d="2020">They're not your ideas.</p>
<p t="5121480" d="1969">It's hard to have your own ideas.</p>
<p t="5123449" d="5590">You have to derive them from your own experience,
and especially when you're not very old, you</p>
<p t="5129039" d="5690">don't have that much experience and so you
can grab books full of ideas and claim them</p>
<p t="5134729" d="2890">for your own which is not acceptable.</p>
<p t="5137619" d="5350">You can use those ideas to inform your ideas,
but they're not your ideas.</p>
<p t="5142969" d="4570">You're just a puppet, and you know the Pinocchio
movie is very interesting that way because</p>
<p t="5147539" d="3551">he's a puppet of forces that are really not
on his side.</p>
<p t="5151090" d="1990">Seriously not on his side.</p>
<p t="5153080" d="2659">Okay anyways, back to the Pinocchio movie.</p>
<p t="5155739" d="1320">Give me one second.</p>
<p t="5157059" d="1670">So Geppetto doesn't have a son.</p>
<p t="5158729" d="1401">Now, Geppetto's a good guy right?</p>
<p t="5160130" d="1020">He's a toymaker.</p>
<p t="5161150" d="2029">He's got this little warm cabin.</p>
<p t="5163179" d="1000">It's cozy.</p>
<p t="5164179" d="1000">He's a good guy.</p>
<p t="5165179" d="1000">He's friendly.</p>
<p t="5166179" d="1000">He has a little cat.</p>
<p t="5167179" d="2960">He pays attention to his little fish, he takes
care of that.</p>
<p t="5170139" d="3860">So we know Geppetto's a good guy and he
makes this puppet and he thinks, “Man I've</p>
<p t="5173999" d="2960">got a puppet but maybe I'd rather have something
real.</p>
<p t="5176959" d="1730">That's a good question for parents.</p>
<p t="5178689" d="3081">You want a puppet, or do you want something
real?</p>
<p t="5181770" d="4480">And the answer is, generally often, I'll
just have a puppet as long as it does exactly</p>
<p t="5186250" d="4239">what it - maybe it'll be a medical school
puppet because that's certainly one good form</p>
<p t="5190489" d="1541">of puppet.</p>
<p t="5192030" d="5629">Okay, so Geppetto decides cause he's a good
guy, he thinks no no I don't want this thing</p>
<p t="5197659" d="1000">to have strings.</p>
<p t="5198659" d="1000">I want it to be its own thing.</p>
<p t="5199659" d="2301">I want it to be autonomous, individual, real.</p>
<p t="5201960" d="2239">Okay, so what does he do?</p>
<p t="5204199" d="1000">He wishes.</p>
<p t="5205199" d="1000">Right?</p>
<p t="5206199" d="1000">What's he wish on?</p>
<p t="5207199" d="1000">A star.</p>
<p t="5208199" d="1820">Why do people wish on stars?</p>
<p t="5210019" d="1580">Of all the crazy things.</p>
<p t="5211599" d="3230">Well it's a divine thing.</p>
<p t="5214829" d="4640">It's like there's heaven, it's all - it's
at the infinite.</p>
<p t="5219469" d="2980">You go out at night and you see the stars,
which you can't in the city but you go out</p>
<p t="5222449" d="4491">somewhere dark and you see the stars, and
it's like you and the infinite.</p>
<p t="5226940" d="1219">And it really is.</p>
<p t="5228159" d="5730">It's a perfect representation of your relationship
with the infinite because the universe is</p>
<p t="5233889" d="4060">about as infinite as you need, and it's
going to give you a sense of awe and that's</p>
<p t="5237949" d="3250">partly why archaic people partly thought God
was in the sky.</p>
<p t="5241199" d="3610">It's like, they weren't stupid, these people.</p>
<p t="5244809" d="7580">They thought God is what fills you with awe,
so you look at the sky and think wow, that's</p>
<p t="5252389" d="1000">something.</p>
<p t="5253389" d="2440">It's an instinct.</p>
<p t="5255829" d="2971">It's not a cognitive construction.</p>
<p t="5258800" d="3819">So anyways, you aim at a star, and it's
this twinkling thing in the darkness, right.</p>
<p t="5262619" d="6611">It's the light in the darkness and it's
above the worldly environment.</p>
<p t="5269230" d="2650">It's something transcendent.</p>
<p t="5271880" d="2029">So that's what Geppetto wishes on.</p>
<p t="5273909" d="2201">It's like, I'm gonna aim high.</p>
<p t="5276110" d="1139">That's what he says.</p>
<p t="5277249" d="1000">Aim high.</p>
<p t="5278249" d="3100">And he thinks well it's not very likely
but I might as well aim high.</p>
<p t="5281349" d="2980">That's a very good piece of advice.</p>
<p t="5284329" d="3741">You want to aim so high you can't attain it
because then you've got something worth - you</p>
<p t="5288070" d="1580">might think that's such perverse.</p>
<p t="5289650" d="2779">That's such a perverse piece of advice.</p>
<p t="5292429" d="3150">Why would you chase something you can't have?</p>
<p t="5295579" d="6031">Well the answer might be cause the chasing
is worth it, and then you might think well</p>
<p t="5301610" d="1000">what's worth it?</p>
<p t="5302610" d="1670">Well I can give you a hint about that too.</p>
<p t="5304280" d="4790">It's like develop your character because
what you've got is what you carry with you</p>
<p t="5309070" d="5199">wherever you go, and it's way better to
be able to do things than to be rich cause</p>
<p t="5314269" d="2460">if you're rich, well then that disappears.</p>
<p t="5316729" d="1171">Poof, you're poor.</p>
<p t="5317900" d="5960">But if you can do things short of being demolished,
and even then people are unbelievable at overcoming</p>
<p t="5323860" d="1000">those things.</p>
<p t="5324860" d="2909">It's like you're on the way.</p>
<p t="5327769" d="4150">Here's an interesting experiment we did
with undergraduate women.</p>
<p t="5331919" d="2930">So, there's this idea in evolutionary psychology.</p>
<p t="5334849" d="5261">It's called hypergamy, and hypergamy is
the tendency of women to choose mates who</p>
<p t="5340110" d="4069">are slightly older than them, it's about
four years on average cross culturally, and</p>
<p t="5344179" d="4530">who are higher in the status hierarchy than
they are.</p>
<p t="5348709" d="5801">It's a very well documented tendency, and
people who are cynical about that think women</p>
<p t="5354510" d="4189">want wealth, and I thought well it's not
a bad theory because it kind of evens the</p>
<p t="5358699" d="1000">scales.</p>
<p t="5359699" d="1051">It's like you're gonna have a family.</p>
<p t="5360750" d="7829">You're basically - a chimpanzee baby clings
to its mother's fur for five thousand miles</p>
<p t="5368579" d="2350">in the three or four years its doing its clinging.</p>
<p t="5370929" d="5221">It's like its a major league impediment,
and you know, if you're a new mother, your</p>
<p t="5376150" d="3750">life is so much more complicated than it is
when you were single that it's not even</p>
<p t="5379900" d="1480">the same conceptual universe.</p>
<p t="5381380" d="5020">It's a major league responsibility, and
it slows you down.</p>
<p t="5386400" d="3739">So you might think the logical thing to do
is to balance the scales a little bit and</p>
<p t="5390139" d="3300">that's perfectly reasonable, but I thought,
“Nah, I bet you women are smarter than that.”</p>
<p t="5393439" d="7680">I bet you can fool them, and the pick up artists
do that all the time because they mimic status.</p>
<p t="5401119" d="4241">So, you can fool them but they're smart.</p>
<p t="5405360" d="3869">So what we did - I never published this for
a bunch of reasons, but.</p>
<p t="5409229" d="5200">Okay so what we did was we took pictures of
the same guy - you know kind of an average</p>
<p t="5414429" d="1000">looking guy.</p>
<p t="5415429" d="6060">He's alright, and we had four stories about
him, and one story was a poor useless guy.</p>
<p t="5421489" d="1601">That's an easy story right.</p>
<p t="5423090" d="4329">You know, sits on his couch, plays video games,
eats Cheetos, covered with dust.</p>
