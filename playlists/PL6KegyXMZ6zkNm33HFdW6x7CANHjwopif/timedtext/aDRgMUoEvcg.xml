<p t="620" d="2040">I&#39;d like to welcome you all to this</p>
<p t="2660" d="1120">important event</p>
<p t="4300" d="2040">and I would also like to apologize to those among</p>
<p t="6340" d="3680">your friends, relatives and colleagues who could not be here today,</p>
<p t="10160" d="3040">as the auditorium sold out in a matter of hours.</p>
<p t="14460" d="2760">My name is Geoffrey Clarfield</p>
<p t="17420" d="4560">It is my privilege to be the executive director of The Speaker&#39;s Action Group.</p>
<p t="21980" d="3820">And I would like to thank founding president Shirley-Anne Haber</p>
<p t="25860" d="2640">and our new president, Irving Weisdorf</p>
<p t="28500" d="4360">and all the volunteers who have worked so hard to make this event happen.</p>
<p t="32860" d="5480">I would also like to thank our partner organization, the Mozuud Freedom Foundation</p>
<p t="38640" d="6500">and The Council for Muslims Facing Tomorrow, who are the joint sponsors of this event.</p>
<p t="45480" d="2880">The Speaker&#39;s Action Group, in particular</p>
<p t="48360" d="1660">and its supporting groups</p>
<p t="50140" d="5080">is dedicated to the fight against anti-semitism and racism.</p>
<p t="56180" d="2940">But without freedom of speech,</p>
<p t="59140" d="5180">there could be no fight against anti-semitism, or racism,</p>
<p t="65040" d="4240">for we need freedom of speech to defend our rights.</p>
<p t="70180" d="5140">And as we will hear today, freedom of speech is most threatened</p>
<p t="75320" d="8200">where, ironically, it should be most free:  in the media, in the colleges, in the universities of this country</p>
<p t="83520" d="2480">as well as in other democracies.</p>
<p t="86780" d="5960">I would like to introduce the M.C. for this afternoon, Faith Goldy, from The Rebel Media,</p>
<p t="92740" d="6280">an organization that is at the fore-front of the fight for free speech in this country.</p>
<p t="99180" d="5720">I&#39;d like her to introduce our two distinguished speakers, Professor Jordan Peterson and Dr. Norman Doidge.</p>
<p t="104900" d="3920">Faith, thank you so much for being here today.</p>
<p t="112380" d="5880">He&#39;s been a dishwasher, a gas jockey, a bartender, a short-order cook, a beekeeper,</p>
<p t="118260" d="4160">a plywood mill laborer, and a railway line worker.</p>
<p t="122540" d="5920">But today, Professor Jordan B. Peterson is best known for his work in the academic world.</p>
<p t="128460" d="6140">He has published more than 100 scientific papers, transforming the modern understanding of personalty</p>
<p t="134600" d="7460">and revolutionizing the psychology of religion with his now classic book, &quot;Maps of Meaning: The Architecture of Belief&quot;.</p>
<p t="142060" d="4720">As a Harvard professor, he was nominated for the prestigeous Levinson Teaching Prize.</p>
<p t="146780" d="6880">Now, at the University of Toronto, he is regarded by students as one of their truly life-changing teachers.</p>
<p t="153660" d="5560">And, I think that I speak for a great deal of people in this room, and frankly across the country, when I say</p>
<p t="159220" d="4300">you needn&#39;t be one of Professor Peterson&#39;s students to have been enlightened and inspired</p>
<p t="163520" d="5000">by that eight-pound universe between his ears, as well as his bravery.</p>
<p t="169160" d="800">(laughter)</p>
<p t="171080" d="6400">Most recently, Dr. Peterson became the center of an ongoing national controversy for refusing</p>
<p t="177480" d="5260">to abide by the University of Toronto&#39;s attempt to put very specific words into his mouth</p>
<p t="182740" d="3660">when they ordered professors comply with the genders pronoun policy.</p>
<p t="186400" d="5900">Dr. Peterson&#39;s vivid dissent over language politics and the political agenda behind it has seen him threatened</p>
<p t="192300" d="4400">and shouted down by snowflake students and the academic hierarchy alike.</p>
<p t="197280" d="6740">As a result of his public views on how &quot;political correctness&quot; violates freedom of speech and academic freedom in the west,</p>
<p t="204020" d="5940">Professor Peterson has become a cultural icon for liberty lovers, and a long-awaited obstruction</p>
<p t="209960" d="3220">to the wayfarers on the long march of the institutions.</p>
<p t="214280" d="3440">Please join me in welcoming Dr. Jordan B. Peterson.</p>
<p t="232580" d="5560">So about ... 3 months ago...</p>
<p t="240700" d="1840">I sat in my office at night--</p>
<p t="242540" d="2060">I wasn&#39;t really sleeping very well,</p>
<p t="244600" d="1720">because my mind was running,</p>
<p t="246340" d="4240">and it was running because I&#39;d just read some policy documents</p>
<p t="250580" d="2280">on the Ontario Human Rights Commission website</p>
<p t="252960" d="3200">in relationship to Bill C16,</p>
<p t="256600" d="2000">and at the same time I had heard</p>
<p t="258680" d="3980">that the University of Toronto, HR &amp; Equity Dept.</p>
<p t="262760" d="5840">vice president had decided to make &quot;anti unconscious bias training&quot; mandatory</p>
<p t="268620" d="2900">mandatory for her staff.</p>
<p t="272420" d="3320">Which I find appalling...</p>
<p t="275980" d="2680">and still find appalling.</p>
<p t="278980" d="6480">and I would recommend if any of you are asked or required to have your unconscious biases adjusted</p>
<p t="286820" d="6080">that you might note to yourself that by agreeing to do so you have agreed that you&#39;re guilty.</p>
<p t="293060" d="2080">And I wouldn&#39;t recommend that.</p>
<p t="295140" d="4940">Anyways, I was mostly trying to straighten out my thoughts on these issues</p>
<p t="300240" d="3120">y&#39;know and that&#39;s usually what I do when I speak</p>
<p t="303660" d="3760">y&#39;know because, and I have a good reputation as a speaker</p>
<p t="307420" d="3960">and I think there&#39;s two reasons for that, and one is I don&#39;t ever speak to a group</p>
<p t="311380" d="2160">I always speak to individuals</p>
<p t="313700" d="4400">I&#39;m not speaking to the group, I&#39;m speaking to individual people.</p>
<p t="318100" d="4520">and I&#39;m not telling you what&#39;s right, because I don&#39;t know what&#39;s right.</p>
<p t="322780" d="3120">What I&#39;m trying to do is to formulate my thoughts.</p>
<p t="325900" d="1960">More clearly.</p>
<p t="327860" d="3320">And it&#39;s helpful to do that in speech, even in front of an audience</p>
<p t="331180" d="4300">because it&#39;s a dialogue with an audience y&#39;know, if you watch the individuals</p>
<p t="335480" d="3240">then you can tell if they are following you, or whether...</p>
<p t="338860" d="3760">mostly whether they&#39;re following you, if they can understand the line of the argumentation.</p>
<p t="342620" d="3240">and some of them will be shaking their heads and some of them will be nodding.</p>
<p t="345860" d="4400">and some of them will be looking puzzled, in which case you kinda have to reformulate</p>
<p t="350260" d="3960">and so, that&#39;s how I... that&#39;s how to think!</p>
<p t="354260" d="2880">y&#39;know, and when you&#39;re speaking to people</p>
<p t="357140" d="3980">it&#39;s okay to tell them what you know, but better to show them how you think.</p>
<p t="361120" d="3180">and that means you&#39;re gonna stumble around like an idiot some of the time</p>
<p t="364300" d="2600">because you&#39;re trying to grapple with things</p>
<p t="366940" d="2900">and what I try to do for my students is to to</p>
<p t="369840" d="4200">model the process of grappling with things.</p>
<p t="374040" d="1620">Because that&#39;s what you do</p>
<p t="375840" d="1300">When you think!</p>
<p t="377140" d="2480">and well Norman (speaker in Pt 1) pointed out</p>
<p t="379620" d="3360">that you can be right, or you can try to get smarter</p>
<p t="382980" d="2840">and to be right, then you convince people that you&#39;re right</p>
<p t="385820" d="3080">but to try to get smarter you find out why you&#39;re wrong.</p>
<p t="388900" d="2740">and so I decided a long time ago, that one of the ways</p>
<p t="391660" d="4000">to deal with my &#39;authoritarian tendencies&#39; lets say,</p>
<p t="395720" d="3640">was to make friends with what I don&#39;t know instead of what I do know.</p>
<p t="399360" d="4680">And that&#39;s a whole different way of looking at the world, and its-- its got its pain</p>
<p t="404040" d="5980">because you&#39;re always trying to figure out why you&#39;re a biased moron</p>
<p t="410020" d="4600">and that&#39;s a very long list-- you have a very long list of reasons</p>
<p t="414660" d="3000">for that, and then you have to find out why you&#39;re wrong</p>
<p t="417660" d="6140">and as a short term mechanism for attaining psychological stability I wouldn&#39;t recommend it.</p>
<p t="424160" d="3820">But as a long term process where you&#39;re trying to make things work better</p>
<p t="427980" d="3200">in the medium to long term, then it&#39;s the only way.</p>
<p t="431320" d="6060">But y&#39;know... It&#39;s easy to sacrifice the future for the present,</p>
<p t="437480" d="3080">although it&#39;s kind of the reverse of the way you should do things.</p>
<p t="440820" d="3720">So anyways I made these videos--pretty amateur videos</p>
<p t="444540" d="4680">and y&#39;know the lighting wasn&#39;t very good and there was a bunch of things wrong with them.</p>
<p t="449860" d="1420">and uh</p>
<p t="451560" d="1160">But!</p>
<p t="455680" d="4420">One of the things I&#39;ve been wondering about for the last three months is just what happened?</p>
<p t="460300" d="4380">What&#39;s going on here? This is crazy! And y&#39;know...</p>
<p t="465000" d="4220">I&#39;ve been accused of a lot of things, some of which are no doubt true.</p>
<p t="469440" d="5700">But I&#39;ve been accused of being a racist and being a transphobe and--what else</p>
<p t="475420" d="4140">profiteering, and I guess the other one was...</p>
<p t="479700" d="2520">scaremongering! Yeah that&#39;s the other one. Scaremongering.</p>
<p t="482220" d="4420">And so course I&#39;ve been wondering if those things are true because</p>
<p t="486700" d="4160">it’s not like my heart is as pure as the driven snow, hardly.</p>
<p t="491540" d="2700">And everyone has biases and all of that.</p>
<p t="494500" d="6420">And I also while this unfolded had a group of friends who were definitely critics</p>
<p t="501020" d="5160">who were watching everything I was doing and letting me know pretty forthrightly</p>
<p t="506220" d="4220">when I was being arrogant or when I was-- looked kinda disheveled</p>
<p t="510440" d="5880">and when my arguments weren&#39;t as clear as they could be and so these were smart people</p>
<p t="516380" d="4020">and their comments were very incisive and then of course I had all the blowback.</p>
<p t="520480" d="5720">and I was paying attention to it because, well, you should pay attention to such things.</p>
<p t="526640" d="4180">And I do pay attention to things! That’s the thing; I actually pay attention to things.</p>
<p t="531560" d="9200">And if I’m embroiled in a controversy even if it’s a problem in my home, I try to get to the damn bottom of it.</p>
<p t="540940" d="3160">And the bottom of things is not a pretty place to look.</p>
<p t="546180" d="4420">Y’know when you&#39;re arguing with someone at home, even someone you love,</p>
<p t="550820" d="3640">you notice that your argument can get out of hand eh? pretty quick so if you&#39;re</p>
<p t="554620" d="6140">arguing with your wife or your husband (and it depends on how volatile you are of course)</p>
<p t="561160" d="8540">but you start arguing about some little thing and then</p>
<p t="570020" d="4680">you come to understand pretty quick that it&#39;s not actually about that little thing at all--</p>
<p t="574840" d="6000">that little thing is associated with a bigger thing underneath that, and maybe that’s associated with</p>
<p t="580920" d="3820">even a bigger thing under that. And soon you&#39;re taking each other apart</p>
<p t="585180" d="3720">(and assuming you&#39;ve been married for twenty years) for all the stupid things you&#39;ve done to each other</p>
<p t="588980" d="4420">over the last twenty years, and it doesn’t have to end there. And that’s not pleasant.</p>
<p t="593480" d="5220">It&#39;s really hard to bind a conversation so it doesn’t go everywhere, so one thing you can do</p>
<p t="598780" d="3140">if you&#39;re talking with someone about something you disagree with--someone you love</p>
<p t="601920" d="3980">you can tell them a bunch of good things about what they’ve been doing which you actually believe</p>
<p t="605900" d="6020">and then just say &quot;well but there’s this little problem here, and I’d just like it adjusted in a minor way.</p>
<p t="611980" d="3300">And maybe that’ll sort things out a bit between us&quot; and maybe you</p>
<p t="615380" d="3180">won’t fall into that stupid pit, which is easy to fall into</p>
<p t="618760" d="3700">which certainly can lead to divorce, among other things.</p>
<p t="622460" d="4940">And so a huge part of the issue always is just exactly what is this about?</p>
<p t="628960" d="5500">Well I’ve been asking myself that question for a long, long time, because I’ve been interested in</p>
<p t="634620" d="7640">authoritarian conflict and atrocity and totalitarianism for way longer than anyone with any sanity should ever be interested in it.</p>
<p t="643740" d="3680">And y&#39;know and then this all came up and I thought ok ok ok.</p>
<p t="647420" d="2680">It’s like alright well y&#39;know...</p>
<p t="650100" d="2420">am I a bigot and a transphobe? well,</p>
<p t="652520" d="7580">I probably have my biases because people tend to have in-group biases and that’s associated, by the way, with compassion!</p>
<p t="660100" d="7940">Just so you know it, because one of the things compassion does is make you much more strongly bound to your in-group.</p>
<p t="668040" d="2240">A mother is compassionate cause she loves her baby</p>
<p t="670280" d="5080">and she loves the baby more than other things that aren’t the baby obviously!</p>
<p t="675660" d="3740">And so actually compassion is one of the main sources of in-group bias</p>
<p t="679400" d="5600">which is something for the compassion warriors to think about for like 3/5ths of a second.</p>
<p t="685000" d="6400">(laughter) There&#39;s nothing less compassionate to you than a motherly grizzly bear protecting her cubs.</p>
<p t="691500" d="2880">and so you should think about that when you think about empathy for a minute.</p>
<p t="694380" d="4060">Because empathy is by no means an untrammeled moral virtue.</p>
<p t="698580" d="4840">In fact, it&#39;s responsible and can be responsible for absolutely atrocious actions.</p>
<p t="703720" d="2000">It depends on who you’re empathizing with.</p>
<p t="707160" d="4840">if you’re empathizing with someone that you regard as an infantilized victim</p>
<p t="712000" d="3100">then you automatically snap into a frame of mind where</p>
<p t="715100" d="6080">everyone who might be oppressing that infantilized victim is a predatory parasite.</p>
<p t="721320" d="3580">And you’re not very bloody empathetic to them I can tell you.</p>
<p t="724900" d="2980">So...that’s a big problem.</p>
<p t="728000" d="3540">Anyways, with regards to this scaremongering issue...</p>
<p t="731540" d="6760">so yeah yeah... biased. Yeah probably. And blind? Definitely.</p>
<p t="738300" d="2860">Like more than you might expect?</p>
<p t="741160" d="4940">No... I don’t think so. and one of things that actually protected me though all this</p>
<p t="746100" d="6200">was that I’ve actually tried to come to terms with the evil that lurks in human hearts, particularly my own.</p>
<p t="752300" d="4420">And I have five hundred hours of lectures of that online, if anybody</p>
<p t="756940" d="1500">has the</p>
<p t="758440" d="1620">bizarre</p>
<p t="760060" d="2000">desire to</p>
<p t="762060" d="4920">pound their way through them they can more or less figure out what I think because</p>
<p t="766980" d="3480">I’ve said 5 hundred of hours of it publicly and so</p>
<p t="770460" d="4520">I didn’t feel too bad about my level of bigotry or hatred.</p>
<p t="775100" d="5000">I think that you can probably infer that from watching the videos, so I was kinda protected on that front.</p>
<p t="780880" d="4060">And then there was this &quot;scaremongering&quot; issue and that’s a good one, that’s a tough one man</p>
<p t="784940" d="3920">because if you look at bill c16 it just kinda looks like</p>
<p t="789000" d="3800">&quot;well we&#39;re extending protection to another oppressed group&quot;</p>
<p t="792920" d="4560">which isn’t actually true because gender identity-- no gender expression--</p>
<p t="797600" d="1500">that&#39;s not a group!</p>
<p t="799300" d="4540">I’d just like to point that out because terminological accuracy actually matters</p>
<p t="804020" d="5100">So we&#39;ve extended legal protection to fashion essentially,</p>
<p t="809260" d="3880">and you can say well maybe I’m being a bit intransigent about that,</p>
<p t="813140" d="2960">but I read the damn policies and I don’t think I am!</p>
<p t="816600" d="5880">And that’s not a group, so that’s an indication of the muddle-headedness behind the legislation.</p>
<p t="822840" d="5760">The federal government-- the department of justice did say on their own website that they were going to interpret that law</p>
<p t="828840" d="3360">in light of the policies of the Ontario Human Rights Commission and so</p>
<p t="832480" d="4920">fine man! Go to the Ontario Human Rights Commission website if they haven’t taken the policies off yet</p>
<p t="837480" d="2000">and read what they&#39;re up to! and if that</p>
<p t="839740" d="1860">If you agree with that, good.</p>
<p t="841600" d="1340">agree with it! But</p>
<p t="842940" d="4040">I would suspect that if you agree with it you didn’t understand it…</p>
<p t="846980" d="1120">or--</p>
<p t="848100" d="1740">or you&#39;re up to something and</p>
<p t="849840" d="1480">that comes to the next part</p>
<p t="851320" d="2340">what are we really talking about here?</p>
<p t="853660" d="4720">Well, we could be talking about my biases and my proclivity to scaremonger.</p>
<p t="858820" d="1900">And you know fair enough, but,</p>
<p t="860720" d="4540">here some reasons we&#39;re not and one is that I have all those lectures on line</p>
<p t="865700" d="5260">and believe me if there was a phrase in any of them that indicated there was something</p>
<p t="870960" d="2740">even vaguely morally corrupt about me</p>
<p t="873700" d="3660">it would have been paraded around as evidence you can be sure of that</p>
<p t="877360" d="2000">so that&#39;s kind of a relief.</p>
<p t="879360" d="3420">I did a lot of soul searching in that last couple of months, and it’s not like</p>
<p t="883020" d="2220">I’m without my problems but</p>
<p t="885780" d="2780">anyways, so what is this about?</p>
<p t="889120" d="1000">well,</p>
<p t="890240" d="1060">we&#39;ll say</p>
<p t="891320" d="2720">hopefully it’s not about me because that&#39;d be stupid.</p>
<p t="894400" d="5080">and so what’s going on? why are all these people watching these videos</p>
<p t="899600" d="3920">these things I made just to figure out what I was thinking</p>
<p t="903920" d="1900">cause I couldn’t sleep one night</p>
<p t="905820" d="2900">and because I’m not very damn happy about that unconscious</p>
<p t="908740" d="4560">bias stuff which I would regard as absolutely reprehensible</p>
<p t="913460" d="4000">that you could be held guilty for your implicit perceptions</p>
<p t="917820" d="2000">think about that!</p>
<p t="920300" d="6540">God, they use that test as a diagnostic test, but it doesn’t meet the criteria for reliability and validity</p>
<p t="926840" d="2100">that you&#39;d use for a diagnostic test</p>
<p t="929220" d="3040">it doesn’t produce the same results one time after another</p>
<p t="932500" d="2000">And you can use it to target anybody</p>
<p t="934740" d="3680">and so go along with it if you want just see what happens!</p>
<p t="938640" d="1280">anyways</p>
<p t="941300" d="4280">so I’ve been thinking about this, what’s going on, why the outcry?</p>
<p t="945940" d="4240">you&#39;d think &quot;well professor Peterson got his 15 minutes of fame&quot;</p>
<p t="950180" d="5360">well I had my 15 minutes of trivial fame several times in my life</p>
<p t="956220" d="5680">there some good things about it, but I am despite what you might think a rather private person so</p>
<p t="962380" d="3660">it’s not like I’m particularly enjoying it</p>
<p t="966040" d="3040">but I thought something when I made those videos I thought</p>
<p t="969100" d="2980">(this is something I learned from reading mythology)</p>
<p t="972560" d="4260">if you have to fight a dragon you should go to its lair before it comes to your village</p>
<p t="977200" d="3160">and so people think of what I did as courageous and</p>
<p t="980700" d="2000">I don’t think that’s right I just think that</p>
<p t="983180" d="3060">I can see danger coming and you get to pick</p>
<p t="986440" d="2260">you get to pick your anxiety</p>
<p t="988920" d="5480">I could be either anxious about speaking or I could be anxious about not speaking</p>
<p t="994460" d="5300">And so I chose to be anxious about speaking, and that’s not exactly courage</p>
<p t="1000080" d="4740">it&#39;s more like common sense but that assumes you’re looking into the future</p>
<p t="1007340" d="1860">so you might say well</p>
<p t="1009200" d="3440">what gives me any special power to look into the future and</p>
<p t="1013020" d="3280">hey that’s a good question I mean god only knows what’s going to happen</p>
<p t="1016300" d="2000">in the next few years y&#39;know I did read</p>
<p t="1018300" d="1760">today this is cool,</p>
<p t="1020140" d="4300">250 thousand people will be lifted out of absolute poverty today</p>
<p t="1024440" d="2900">and 300 thousand more will be connected to electricity</p>
<p t="1027640" d="7780">and we&#39;re knocking down poverty rates around the world down faster by a huge margin than we ever have in human history!</p>
<p t="1035620" d="6440">There was an article in the New York Times today called &quot;Why 2016 Was The Best Year Ever&quot; it’s really worth reading</p>
<p t="1042080" d="2800">I concluded the same thing, I worked for a UN committee</p>
<p t="1045000" d="3780">a couple years ago and I was looking at what was going to happen about down the road</p>
<p t="1048840" d="2340">everything I kept reading was well wow!</p>
<p t="1051180" d="4320">we&#39;re getting rid of polio, we&#39;re getting rid of elephantiasis which you really don’t want to have,</p>
<p t="1055500" d="2640">we&#39;re getting rid of guinea worm, were getting rid of polio,</p>
<p t="1058200" d="3160">we&#39;re knocking malaria back into that swamps from where it comes</p>
<p t="1061480" d="2440">were lifting people out of poverty, it’s like</p>
<p t="1064020" d="4420">man we&#39;re doing a lot of great things you’d sure never guess that by the way we treat ourselves</p>
<p t="1069100" d="2740">So, anyways, so what’s going on?</p>
<p t="1072000" d="4340">ok so I thought well I better think about this I’ve been thinking for a long time, so</p>
<p t="1077840" d="2940">y&#39;know the right wing is really hard on the</p>
<p t="1081020" d="6140">Frankfurt school, y’know the Frankfurt school were these kinda neomarxists guys who combined Marxism with</p>
<p t="1088620" d="2260">Freudianism in the 1940s and</p>
<p t="1091660" d="4540">and they were avowed neomarxist so it’s not like I’m making an accusation</p>
<p t="1096480" d="3420">and they were kinda anti-system type people and</p>
<p t="1099900" d="2000">all of that, but I think to lay</p>
<p t="1102000" d="3980">what’s happening at the universities and in the broader culture</p>
<p t="1106080" d="3300">itself at the feet of the Frankfurt school is insufficient</p>
<p t="1109580" d="4660">I really think that it’s primarily a consequence of the French intellectuals who</p>
<p t="1114620" d="5480">(and this is obviously an oversimplification) who emerged out of Marxism in the early 1970s</p>
<p t="1120100" d="2000">and produced post-modernism. now,</p>
<p t="1122660" d="5000">the thing about the post-modernist types is they&#39;re nested inside Marxism</p>
<p t="1127800" d="4540">they say that straight out, I’m not inventing this, you read Derrida</p>
<p t="1132400" d="2700">who&#39;s like the, the joker at the</p>
<p t="1135140" d="2000">at the head of the post-modernist movement</p>
<p t="1137360" d="2400">and I mean joker because he&#39;s</p>
<p t="1139760" d="4180">he&#39;s an intellectual clown and that doesn’t mean he’s stupid because he is not stupid</p>
<p t="1144160" d="2660">not at all, these people are not stupid</p>
<p t="1146920" d="2960">they know exactly what they&#39;re doing they know precisely what they’re doing</p>
<p t="1149920" d="3100">they’re a helluva lot more educated about what they&#39;re doing than you are</p>
<p t="1153020" d="3780">unless you happened to be one of them, and they mean exactly what they say</p>
<p t="1156800" d="4080">just like people always do when they tell you what they’re going to do, or they write it down</p>
<p t="1161060" d="2340">And they say straight out on their websites</p>
<p t="1163860" d="2000">say the women’s studies websites:</p>
<p t="1165860" d="6420">&quot;we think the patriarchy is an oppressive structure that should be broken down to its core&quot;</p>
<p t="1172280" d="2000">and they mean core conceptions,</p>
<p t="1174460" d="4640">it’s not just social, it’s linguistic, philosophical, and attitudinal</p>
<p t="1179360" d="1840">It should be broken down</p>
<p t="1181480" d="5320">and wiped out and restructured from the bottom up and they mean that</p>
<p t="1188020" d="2800">so, it’s not accidental any of this</p>
<p t="1190820" d="3460">and I know it sounds like a bloody paranoid conspiracy theory, but</p>
<p t="1194460" d="820">y&#39;know I&#39;ve</p>
<p t="1195400" d="3440">I’ve always been of the idea especially from reading Jung that</p>
<p t="1199500" d="3780">people don’t have ideas, ideas have people</p>
<p t="1203720" d="5840">And these are powerful ideas! There’s a good book called &quot;explaining post-modernism&quot; that I might recommend by a guy named</p>
<p t="1209740" d="2000">Steven R.C. Hicks and</p>
<p t="1211900" d="3000">His first chapter which isn’t very long is a good</p>
<p t="1215200" d="3060">introduction to political correctness but so</p>
<p t="1218900" d="3480">. So why do I think this is about that?</p>
<p t="1222520" d="4040">well here&#39;s my reasons, I mean it doesn’t seem to be about me</p>
<p t="1226620" d="4120">I think all I did actually was actually make the general specific</p>
<p t="1230880" d="2760">which is kinda what you have to do if you really want to make a point</p>
<p t="1233640" d="1160">A point!</p>
<p t="1235060" d="2960">That’s one place if you want to make a point.</p>
<p t="1238140" d="3280">And my point was: I’m not saying made up words</p>
<p t="1241420" d="5940">generated by post-modern neomarxists because I despise everything they stand for,</p>
<p t="1247380" d="2480">and so I’m not using those damn words</p>
<p t="1249860" d="2000">And that’s that! (applause)</p>
<p t="1251860" d="4180">(applause)</p>
<p t="1257120" d="3680">And it’s not like I have something against transgender people</p>
<p t="1260800" d="2680">I’m sure some of them are lovely people and some of them aren’t</p>
<p t="1263740" d="4480">and so they can do whatever they want as far as I’m concerned as long as they don’t--</p>
<p t="1269120" d="3340">they can do whatever they want as far as I’m concerned</p>
<p t="1272820" d="2000">as long as I’m not forced</p>
<p t="1274860" d="5860">to go along with the most radical representatives of them who don’t even speak for them</p>
<p t="1280720" d="1260">anyways!</p>
<p t="1282020" d="5000">I’ve got like 20 letters from transsexual people supporting what I’ve done, and like</p>
<p t="1287200" d="2000">none opposing it!</p>
<p t="1289260" d="3540">One of the things that’s kinda cool is I’ve only got like 3 hate letters</p>
<p t="1293340" d="2660">(laughter) I thought three! Jesus you guys,</p>
<p t="1296000" d="2000">(applause)</p>
<p t="1298480" d="3740">you guys aren’t trying very hard! (laughter)</p>
<p t="1303320" d="4060">And I got like a thousand letters of support and if you go on YouTube</p>
<p t="1307380" d="3200">where I’m radically over-represented</p>
<p t="1311380" d="4140">and you look at the comments and the likes and the dislikes it’s about the same ratio</p>
<p t="1315520" d="5240">Likes to dislikes are 100 to 1, and almost all the comments are positive</p>
<p t="1321020" d="3640">which could easily be a selection bias and probably is, but</p>
<p t="1324660" d="4760">it means there are quite a few people who think that what I’m doing is</p>
<p t="1329420" d="3860">sort of ok as far as they&#39;re concerned and that’s important</p>
<p t="1334960" d="5500">Anyways, we need to talk a little bit about post-modernism, ok? So let’s go back to France</p>
<p t="1340920" d="2740">in the end of the 1960s so</p>
<p t="1343660" d="4200">and this is of course an oversimplification and I’m sure I’m wrong about some of it because</p>
<p t="1347860" d="4680">it’s not exactly my field of specialty this field of sociology</p>
<p t="1353040" d="2000">I’m more of a scientist type but</p>
<p t="1355480" d="3980">and if I read philosophy I tend not to read second-rate philosophy</p>
<p t="1359460" d="7300">so I’ve tried to avoid the post-modernists to some degree because their incoherency is one of the least of their sins</p>
<p t="1366760" d="4100">but they don’t care about that, (laughter) no, no you’ve got to understand, man</p>
<p t="1371080" d="5080">Its modernist and enlightenment people and even traditionalist who care about coherency</p>
<p t="1376160" d="5780">The post-modernists don’t believe in coherency and I’m not making this up, this is a part of their philosophy</p>
<p t="1381940" d="2000">They don’t believe in logic</p>
<p t="1384060" d="5640">you know Derrida says straight out that western society is &quot;phallo-logos-centered&quot;</p>
<p t="1389700" d="4200">by which he means male-centered and privileging the idea of logic</p>
<p t="1394120" d="5020">Well, he doesn’t buy any of that. he doesn’t think there’s a truth that’s out there, he doesn’t believe that</p>
<p t="1399140" d="4080">individuals can reach any sort of truth by thinking, we certainly doesn’t believe</p>
<p t="1403220" d="5160">that we can move towards truth in dialogue cause that’s &quot;dialogic&quot; right, there’s none of that</p>
<p t="1408540" d="5040">You wonder &quot;Well why do the post-modern types keep other thinker off that campus?&quot;</p>
<p t="1413800" d="2000">well it’s not cause they&#39;re afraid</p>
<p t="1416280" d="5920">well some of them are, but they use their fragility as a mask for their underlying philosophical</p>
<p t="1422400" d="2580">their underlying philosophical and political interests</p>
<p t="1425020" d="2800">they do that fragmentarily it’s not every</p>
<p t="1428200" d="2500">every social justice warrior is a</p>
<p t="1431180" d="4380">sword carrying post-modernist, but the ideas are fragmented and distributed</p>
<p t="1435720" d="2980">among them like they&#39;re distributed among a mob</p>
<p t="1438700" d="5200">and if you put the whole mob together you get the whole  post-modernist thing happening at the same time</p>
<p t="1443900" d="3580">and that’s how ideas have people instead of the other way around.</p>
<p t="1447880" d="980">anyways</p>
<p t="1449280" d="1600">forget about logic</p>
<p t="1451400" d="3380">that’s out the window that’s just a construct of western society</p>
<p t="1455120" d="4440">and the whole point of the construct was to oppress other people and take their wealth</p>
<p t="1459660" d="4700">and to privilege the people who live within that so called logic system</p>
<p t="1464360" d="5840">so that they can justify to themselves and other people their predator rapaciousness.</p>
<p t="1470580" d="1400">Straight and simple</p>
<p t="1472240" d="5220">and that&#39;s partly because post-modernism was influenced by Marxism and of course that’s what the Marxist think about</p>
<p t="1477460" d="5520">any situation where there’s a power/status differential: the people at the top</p>
<p t="1482980" d="3640">are only there because they&#39;ve stolen everything from the people at the bottom</p>
<p t="1487040" d="5320">and so the Marxists in France realized, by the end of the 1960s</p>
<p t="1492480" d="4840">thereabouts when even john Paul Sartre finally figured out that to be communist</p>
<p t="1497460" d="8620">probably wasn’t acceptable given that the bloody soviets had killed like 30 million between 1919 and 1959</p>
<p t="1506320" d="4240">and the Maoists had done the same thing on a greater scale in China</p>
<p t="1510560" d="3280">and we could talk about north Korea, and y&#39;know</p>
<p t="1514200" d="4040">but whatever students don’t learn any of that in school</p>
<p t="1518240" d="2840">anymore and even if they did they wouldn’t wanna listen to it.</p>
<p t="1521080" d="4100">When I tell my students in my second-year psychology class about</p>
<p t="1525180" d="4480">the gulag archipelago, hardly any of them know! Well why is that?</p>
<p t="1529880" d="2940">Well, it’s because they haven’t been taught it!</p>
<p t="1533300" d="3500">Why is that? Well see if you can figure it out!</p>
<p t="1537360" d="1060">(laughter) alright so</p>
<p t="1539320" d="1620">so anyways</p>
<p t="1541360" d="2000">back to the post-modern types, so</p>
<p t="1543640" d="5920">y&#39;know it got to the point where there&#39;s just no way you could be a Marxist especially after Solzhenitsyn because</p>
<p t="1549560" d="4820">Solzhenitsyn wrote this great book which is actually out of print (for crying out loud)</p>
<p t="1554380" d="5620">which I’ve actually been able to popularize like mad over the last three months, which y&#39;know if really mind-boggling</p>
<p t="1560000" d="8780">What Solzhenitsyn did in his genius manner, cause he&#39;s up there Dostoyevsky and Tolstoy like man that guy! He’s a towering intellect</p>
<p t="1568780" d="14600">and a person of spectacular moral force. He put himself on the line for that book, he memorized it in the prison camps it’s about 3 volumes that thick, it’s like 2 thousand pages</p>
<p t="1583380" d="4300">of someone screaming-- the smartest person you&#39;ve ever met</p>
<p t="1587860" d="8120">the wisest person you&#39;ve even met screaming in outrage for 2 thousand pages (It’s no bloody wonder it’s out print)</p>
<p t="1595980" d="2000">(laughter)</p>
<p t="1597980" d="2820">Anyways what Solzhenitsyn did was</p>
<p t="1602800" d="5600">take on this claim you often here the radical leftists make about communism, about Marxism</p>
<p t="1608720" d="5400">they say &quot;well that wasn’t real Marxism.&quot; OK, well how many countries</p>
<p t="1614220" d="7780">do you need to disprove your thesis? How many millions of people have to die before you might admit that you’re wrong</p>
<p t="1622100" d="6580">Well obviously more than 100 million because that&#39;s the approximate total probably an underestimate</p>
<p t="1628680" d="5580">but we&#39;ll be conservative because adding another 10 million doesn’t really make that much difference</p>
<p t="1634940" d="5880">So Solzhenitsyn took that argument apart, partly in his book &quot;Lenin and Zurich&quot; and partly in</p>
<p t="1641720" d="6100">&quot;the gulag archipelago&quot; but the groundwork had already been laid for all that by Nietzsche who knew exactly what was coming in the 20th century</p>
<p t="1647820" d="6420">and by Dostoyevsky who wrote a book called &quot;the possessed&quot; back in 1880 where he outlined in painful detail</p>
<p t="1654240" d="4440">the precise mindset that would produce the Russian revolution like 30 years later</p>
<p t="1658980" d="6200">Amazing. And Tolstoy as well! He knew what was coming, it made him suicidal. He wrote in his confession</p>
<p t="1665180" d="8880">that the conflict between the ideas of Russia: the traditional ideas and the enlightenment ideas sweeping in from the west</p>
<p t="1674100" d="7960">they blew his worldview apart (which was traditional religious) blew his worldview apart so badly that he was suicidal at the height of his fame</p>
<p t="1682160" d="2000">Tolstoy knew what was going to come too</p>
<p t="1684300" d="4320">So it’s not like Solzhenitsyn was the only person who could see this, Orwell knew it</p>
<p t="1688620" d="5300">Malcolm Muggeridge knew it in the 1930s when he noting that the soviets</p>
<p t="1694200" d="6820">given their idea of class guilt, which sounds like a lot like white privilege to me, or any other form of racism</p>
<p t="1701440" d="1060">*sips tea* *inhales*</p>
<p t="1703540" d="9200">they used that doctrine to just round up all the kulaks (they were the productive farmers) and shipped them off to Siberia and then 6 million Ukrainians starved to death but y&#39;know</p>
<p t="1712740" d="3160">they had too many Ukrainians anyways so it didn’t really matter.</p>
<p t="1717540" d="2700">Anyways back to the post-modern types well</p>
<p t="1720440" d="4260">this all came-- was revealed in such painful detail</p>
<p t="1724920" d="5320">that even the kind of closed minded ideologue that Norman (speaker from part 1) referred to, just quite couldn&#39;t--</p>
<p t="1730400" d="5180">couldn’t quite muster up the moral courage to keep beating the same damn drum</p>
<p t="1736120" d="6080">so what they did instead, being highly intelligent individuals was play a game of sleight of hand and transformed</p>
<p t="1742200" d="4340">these Marxist presuppositions into post modernism in the 1970s</p>
<p t="1746640" d="8320">and the idea basically was &quot;well the working class isn’t going to rise up and crush the bourgeoisie&quot; because first of all they&#39;re getting rich and that wasn’t supposed to happen</p>
<p t="1755060" d="4380">and second, well it sorta seemed to be a catastrophe when that occurred let’s say in Russia</p>
<p t="1759440" d="5920">And so maybe we won’t do that anymore cause the working class actually isn’t buying into this either, which is also a problem</p>
<p t="1765460" d="6520">having internalized their own oppression, they wouldn’t buy into this the global myth of utopia</p>
<p t="1772620" d="3860">Maybe it’s cause they had some sense! It’s certainly possible</p>
<p t="1776780" d="7780">but anyway the slight of hand was &quot;oh well fine we&#39;ll just play a different oppressor vs. oppressed game, and we&#39;ll introduce identity politics&quot;</p>
<p t="1785860" d="5680">It’s like &quot;ok ok you&#39;re not being oppressed cause you&#39;re a member of the working class, your oppressed because you’re a woman</p>
<p t="1791980" d="6300">or your being oppressed because you have an ethnicity that’s outside the main paradigm (whatever that might be)</p>
<p t="1799200" d="8060">or it’s because of your sexual preference or your sexual identity, or whatever! Whatever places you in some manner</p>
<p t="1807260" d="4580">outside of the normative culture? And y&#39;know, the thing is the post-modernists</p>
<p t="1811840" d="5520">you might think well your culture&#39;s good for something it gives you a hierarchy of value, it rewards competent people</p>
<p t="1817360" d="5580">it gives you directions so you can climb up cause otherwise everything is leveled to nothing and why do anything</p>
<p t="1822940" d="5740">They don’t care about any of that, they don’t believe that there’s any such thing as competence, they don’t believe that there&#39;s any such thing as up.</p>
<p t="1830080" d="2380">Post-modernism wipes all of that out</p>
<p t="1832800" d="7020">and so when the post-modernists analyze a text all they care about is how it privileges the position of the author and who it impresses</p>
<p t="1840040" d="8320">and that’s the only thing they regard as real, and they don’t believe in grand unifying narratives they don’t believe that there’s a Canadian identity, they don’t believe that there’s an American identity</p>
<p t="1848360" d="4940">they don’t believe that there’s a western identity, they don’t believe that value structures exist</p>
<p t="1853300" d="5500">or if they are they&#39;re replaceable with some other value structure, they certainly don’t believe that they have any</p>
<p t="1858880" d="5740">biological grounding that there&#39;s any such thing as a human being, it’s all socially constructed</p>
<p t="1864760" d="7680">which is really convenient if what you want to do is be the author of an entirely socially constructed utopia that you can run</p>
<p t="1872440" d="6520">And then when the Marxists say &quot;well that wasn’t real Marxism&quot; what it really means-- and I’ve thought about this for a long time</p>
<p t="1878960" d="3980">it’s the most arrogant possible statement anyone could ever make</p>
<p t="1882940" d="7740">It means: &quot;if I would’ve been in Stalin’s position I would&#39;ve ushered in the damn utopia instead of the genocidal massacres</p>
<p t="1890680" d="5260">because I understand the doctrine of Marxism and everything about me is good&quot;</p>
<p t="1896020" d="2240">it’s like well think again sunshine (laughter)</p>
<p t="1898460" d="3040">you don&#39;t understand it, you don&#39;t understand it</p>
<p t="1901500" d="1820">and you&#39;re not that good</p>
<p t="1903320" d="4740">and if the power was in your hands assuming you had the competence, which you don’t</p>
<p t="1909200" d="8700">you wouldn’t have done any better, and even if you had there would have been someone else waiting right behind you to shoot you the first time you actually tried to do anything good</p>
<p t="1917900" d="8780">and that’s what happened to all the old guard who ran the damn revolution. Stalin rounded them all up and shot them along with their families and millions of other people</p>
<p t="1926760" d="12920">So even if you do happen to be that avatar of moral purity that you claim implicitly, the probability that you’d get to act out your goodness in relationship to those possessed by your ideology is zero.</p>
<p t="1940360" d="6160">(applause)</p>
<p t="1948940" d="5400">So y&#39;know you think well why are these post-modernists doing what they&#39;re doing? Why do they oppose the patriarchy</p>
<p t="1954340" d="5560">Here&#39;s a question: why don’t the feminists complain about Saudi Arabia? It’s like</p>
<p t="1960360" d="4100">(applause)</p>
<p t="1965000" d="3640">Y&#39;know Gad Saad (?), who&#39;s this guy at Concordia who</p>
<p t="1968640" d="4280">is in the business school so he can actually say what he thinks now and then</p>
<p t="1973840" d="1660">he tweeted yesterday well</p>
<p t="1975500" d="6200">he tweeted to the women&#39;s march because there’s a little twitter thing you can do that I suppose for the organizers, and he said</p>
<p t="1982100" d="5580">&quot;why don’t you go to the middle east and have a nice march against Saudi Arabia and see how that works out for ya?&quot;</p>
<p t="1989160" d="4120">so you think well why not? why not? why are</p>
<p t="1993280" d="4640">Why are the radical leftists who are so much for rights everywhere, that’s what they say</p>
<p t="1997920" d="4280">why aren’t they complaining about Saudi Arabia for example, which y&#39;know</p>
<p t="2002200" d="7100">breeds a particularly pathological form of ideologically rigid Islam that basically enslaves their women</p>
<p t="2009480" d="4440">that’s to put it properly. Why not complain about that? Well how about this</p>
<p t="2014180" d="2600">the enemy of my enemy is my friend</p>
<p t="2017880" d="6160">So when push comes to shove you see how much concern there is among the radical feminists for the rights of women</p>
<p t="2024060" d="7160">It’s like if the--  if pushing those rights forward doesn’t also at the same time undermine</p>
<p t="2031220" d="4940">if pushing those rights forward doesn’t also at the same time undermine the western patriarchy then we&#39;ll take the undermining and leave the damn rights behind</p>
<p t="2036440" d="4580">And so there’s an insight for you about exactly what goes on at the bottom of all this</p>
<p t="2044240" d="4880">ok so then there’s another weird thing and I’ve already sort of hit on it tangentially</p>
<p t="2049120" d="4820">well the post-modernists don’t believe in grand unifying narratives they don’t believe in narratives at all</p>
<p t="2053940" d="6520">they don’t care about value because they never noticed that you have to value something in order to have some hope in life right</p>
<p t="2061040" d="5980">Because when you value something you&#39;re pursuing it, and in the pursuit that’s where the meaning in life is</p>
<p t="2067020" d="5580">cause the rest of its suffering. if you&#39;re trying to struggle upwards towards the light it’s like well</p>
<p t="2072600" d="7640">that’s something to motivate and protect you against the suffering but the post-modernists don’t care about any of that and would say</p>
<p t="2080240" d="2000">it’s because they don’t care about suffering.</p>
<p t="2083780" d="2000">so alright so</p>
<p t="2086340" d="2980">here&#39;s the final question it&#39;s like well</p>
<p t="2089800" d="3720">if the post modernists don’t care about grand unifying narratives and they don’t</p>
<p t="2093520" d="6080">believe in identity why in the world are they willing to believe in gender identity and sexual identity</p>
<p t="2099600" d="3800">and racial identity and ethnic identity and the answer to that is</p>
<p t="2103800" d="4460">well they can’t! but they don’t care because coherence isn’t on their agenda</p>
<p t="2108260" d="6360">and besides that when push comes to shove their post modernism is nested inside a deeper Marxism</p>
<p t="2114620" d="7020">so when the post-modernism doesn’t suffice, say to push forward the idea that western civilization should be overturned</p>
<p t="2121640" d="6740">they just revert back to the over-arching Marxism and say well &quot;those people are oppressed and that’s a bad thing&quot;</p>
<p t="2128540" d="4580">you might say &quot;well you’re a post-modernist you don’t believe in any of that&quot; and they say &quot;well</p>
<p t="2133120" d="8940">yeah I’m only a post-modernist this deep but underneath that there’s a Marxism and I can always rely on that to fill in the gaps&quot; and that’s exactly what’s happening.</p>
<p t="2144060" d="2700">So that’s what’s happening as far as I can tell.</p>
<p t="2147980" d="5420">So why do I believe this? well there’s a little war going on in our culture maybe it’s not so little</p>
<p t="2153400" d="3260">I put my finger on it and I wouldn’t recommend that by the way (laughter)</p>
<p t="2156860" d="4000">because ok you explain it man! You explain like</p>
<p t="2160860" d="7600">why 3 million have watched the UofT free speech and I think 7 million people downloaded the Joe Rogan podcast</p>
<p t="2168460" d="4700">and it’s like crazy its crazy there was a 180 newspaper articles about this</p>
<p t="2173160" d="2000">It was news for 4 months!</p>
<p t="2175160" d="2900">Why? Who cares what I think?</p>
<p t="2178380" d="4200">God I don’t even care that much about what I think! (Laughter)</p>
<p t="2187060" d="2000">Well what about Trump?</p>
<p t="2190160" d="3860">What’s going on there? (Applause) What’s going on there exactly?</p>
<p t="2194020" d="3920">It was interesting listening to trump&#39;s inauguration speech because</p>
<p t="2197940" d="3620">I detected elements of national socialist thought in it</p>
<p t="2201640" d="4240">and I’m not being dismissive I’m seriously not being dismissive</p>
<p t="2205880" d="5340">but when you radically activate on the side of the left you call forth</p>
<p t="2211220" d="8340">compensatory forces and their not in your control and trump opened his speech you just read it he sounds like a 1950s socialist.</p>
<p t="2219560" d="8740">he&#39;s gonna use the power of the state to bring the industry home to produce a lot of infrastructure it’s a state-business unity with the state in charge</p>
<p t="2228300" d="9460">and then at the end of his speech which is where he stops being the international kind of socialist he says &quot;well borders are really important and so is national identity&quot; and</p>
<p t="2237760" d="6420">he does embed that within belief in god which is probably a good thing assuming that he&#39;s serious about that.</p>
<p t="2244480" d="1740">but y&#39;know</p>
<p t="2246480" d="8860">but y&#39;know the fact that trump was elected and that there was such a fight between him and the clintonites and that the clintonites were playing identity politics instead of speaking</p>
<p t="2255340" d="3980">for the working class who then trump coopted like he should’ve.</p>
<p t="2259940" d="5520">There! There’s a war going on there! And then what about Brexit, what’s going on there? And what about France</p>
<p t="2265460" d="4140">with marine le pen and what about Holland with wilders y&#39;know?</p>
<p t="2269820" d="5680">Watch it! we&#39;re in a chaotic time and I’ve gotten letters from people all over the world who</p>
<p t="2275580" d="6920">tell me how they can’t say what they think it’s like &quot;oh well that’s not very good.&quot; and they&#39;re kinda happy with me cause maybe they think I</p>
<p t="2282500" d="4040">embolden them in some way and so good for that, hypothetically</p>
<p t="2286540" d="5740">And most of the people who write me the overwhelming majority were reasonable so pretty happy about that too</p>
<p t="2292280" d="8220">But and maybe I’m wrong about my damn diagnosis because like what do I know? but I do have this proclivity to get to the bottom of things</p>
<p t="2300600" d="11340">and what’s at the bottom of this is an ideological or philosophical war its even deeper than that, it might even be deeper than a philosophical war which is something that’s more like a metaphysical or theological war</p>
<p t="2312460" d="7100">it depends on how far down you look and the postmodernists know exactly what they&#39;re doing this isn’t accidental of course you shut down</p>
<p t="2319560" d="9260">speakers you don’t agree with because you can’t have a dialogue with them anyways because human beings can’t have dialogue there’s no such thing as a human individual there’s no such thing as truth</p>
<p t="2328820" d="4120">Here’s the post-modern world, it’s the Hobbesian nightmare</p>
<p t="2332940" d="8880">it&#39;s everyone against everyone else, except it’s not individuals its groups and you’re stuck in your damn group and it’s the only thing about you anyways that’s relevant</p>
<p t="2341820" d="3440">which is why we might base our hiring about it for example</p>
<p t="2345260" d="6580">and you&#39;re oppressed and even if you don’t know it its only because you’ve internalized it and it’s the only thing that’s real about you anyways</p>
<p t="2351840" d="5340">And I can’t talk to you because I’m in my own little silo of privileged belief</p>
<p t="2357180" d="3140">and besides we can’t use logic because that doesn’t exist</p>
<p t="2360320" d="3760">and so you’re in a group and I’m in a group and all we can do is have a war!</p>
<p t="2364820" d="5500">Or we can talk but we don’t get to talk cause you can’t talk in yore a post-modernist because speech is just chatter</p>
<p t="2370900" d="6700">it&#39;s just chatter that supports the people in power. That’s how they think and so the whole world is</p>
<p t="2377900" d="5940">this little armed war of identity group against identity group against identity group</p>
<p t="2383920" d="5920">And you shut down people who don’t agree with you because why should you let them talk?</p>
<p t="2389840" d="3780">you don’t believe in any of the reasons why you would let someone talk</p>
<p t="2393620" d="5600">this isn’t accidental it’s not cause they’re afraid although it’s also because of that</p>
<p t="2399220" d="5880">they highjack y&#39;know fear, they highjack compassion they make anyone who</p>
<p t="2405100" d="4640">who puts forwards an alternative view into a terrorist of ideas and</p>
<p t="2409740" d="6260">someone who’s heartless at the core. which is really incredibly intelligent, it’s such a good strategy</p>
<p t="2416000" d="10040">, it’s so devious and brilliant and it’s so effective, cause who the hell wants to be labeled a bigot, you probably are a damn bigot just like everyone else!</p>
<p t="2426040" d="5120">So it’s easy to make people feel guilty about that and maybe they should!</p>
<p t="2433720" d="2180">So anyways what’s going on?</p>
<p t="2436700" d="2680">Well, that’s what’s going on. And so what do you do about it? Well</p>
<p t="2439380" d="5100">I don’t know what you do about it but I have a theory and that’s one I’ve been working on for like 40 years</p>
<p t="2444480" d="2480">so one of the problems with post-modernism--</p>
<p t="2446960" d="2580">(and I’m gonna take 5 minutes, and then we&#39;re done)</p>
<p t="2449540" d="6180">) one of the problems with post-modernism is that-- and this is a big problem this is a fatal problem apart</p>
<p t="2455720" d="8360">from the fact that its incoherent and there’s no value structure and its fundamentally divisive and destructive-- there’s a logical problem with it too that’s even worse</p>
<p t="2464080" d="5500">and so you might be noticing that the LGBT set of acronyms keeps growing eh?</p>
<p t="2469580" d="6600">and its kinda a form of its own parody in some sense, it’s like &quot;well I’m oppressed!&quot; it’s like &quot;yeah yeah you are&quot; and</p>
<p t="2476180" d="7800">&quot;well I’m oppressed too!&quot; yeah you&#39;re also oppressed and maybe I’m even oppressing you being a part of this other marginalized group but at least we share our oppression</p>
<p t="2483980" d="3420">&quot;Well I’m also oppressed&quot; &quot;well so am I!&quot; &quot;I’m oppressed too!&quot;</p>
<p t="2487400" d="1960">it’s like *ttrrrr* (laughter)</p>
<p t="2489360" d="2960">Okay so here’s a problem there’s a big problem here</p>
<p t="2492320" d="2000">The problem is, it’s true!</p>
<p t="2494320" d="4500">You’re oppressed. You’re oppressed. You’re oppressed. You’re oppressed. You’re oppressed. God only knows why</p>
<p t="2498820" d="6380">maybe you’re too short or not as beautiful as you could be or y&#39;know your grand-parent was a serf. Likely! Cause</p>
<p t="2505200" d="5560">almost everybody&#39;s great-grandparent was. And y&#39;know you&#39;re not as smart as you could be</p>
<p t="2510760" d="5440">and you have a sick relative and you have your own physical problems it&#39;s like frankly you&#39;re a mess</p>
<p t="2516200" d="5500">And you’re oppressed in every possible way including your ancestry and biology</p>
<p t="2521700" d="5580">and the entire sum of human history has conspired to produce victimized you</p>
<p t="2527280" d="4560">With all your individual pathological problems. It’s like YES!</p>
<p t="2531840" d="5360">TRUE! Okay, but the problem is that it is true and so</p>
<p t="2537200" d="4100">so if you take the oppressed you have to fractionate them and fractionate them and its like</p>
<p t="2541300" d="4560">you’re a woman yeah okay well I’m a black woman. Well I’m a black woman who has two children. Well I’m a black woman who has two children</p>
<p t="2545860" d="4460">and one of them isn’t very healthy. and then, well</p>
<p t="2550320" d="6120">well I’m a Hispanic women and I have a genius son who doesn’t have any money so he can’t go to university</p>
<p t="2556480" d="5160">and I had a hell of a time getting across the border and it was really hard on me to get my citizenship my</p>
<p t="2561640" d="2240">husband is an alcoholic brute. It’s like</p>
<p t="2563880" d="7140">&quot;well yeah that sucks too!&quot; and so well so let’s fix all your oppression</p>
<p t="2571200" d="5220">And we&#39;ll take every single thing in to account and then we&#39;ll fix yours too we&#39;ll take every single thing into account.</p>
<p t="2576420" d="6200">no you won’t because you can’t! You can’t! It’s technically impossible</p>
<p t="2582620" d="3280">First of all you can’t even list all the ways you&#39;re oppressed</p>
<p t="2585900" d="2360">second, how are you gonna weight them?</p>
<p t="2588260" d="6040">Third, who&#39;s gonna to decide and that’s the bloody thing. Who’s gonna decide? That’s the thing!</p>
<p t="2594300" d="5840">Well what’s the answer in the west? It’s like in free markets. Oh yeah Christ we&#39;ll never be able to solve this</p>
<p t="2600140" d="5620">problem no one can solve it. What are we gonna do about that? We’re gonna outsource it to the market place</p>
<p t="2605760" d="6340">You’re gonna take your sorry pathetic being and you’re gonna try offer me something that maybe I want</p>
<p t="2612100" d="6460">and I’m gonna take me sorry pathetic being and I’m gonna say well all things considered</p>
<p t="2618820" d="5480">as well as I can understand them maybe I could give you this much money (which is actually a promise)</p>
<p t="2624300" d="4940">for that thing. And you&#39;ve packed all of your damn oppression into the price!</p>
<p t="2629240" d="5160">And I’ve packed all my oppression in to the willingness to pay it. And that solution sucks</p>
<p t="2634400" d="4000">It’s a bad solution! But compared to every other solution man</p>
<p t="2638400" d="2540">its why 10 percent of us have freedom</p>
<p t="2640940" d="5160">And so there’s a tremendous illogic at the bottom of this, it’s like,</p>
<p t="2647700" d="4600">you have to fractionate the oppressed all the way done to the level of the individual</p>
<p t="2652300" d="4580">Well that’s what the west figured out. y&#39;know there&#39;s a couple of figures who at the</p>
<p t="2656880" d="8660">mythological roots of our culture and y’know people get upset with me because I bring in religious themes, but I understand some things about mythology and religion</p>
<p t="2665540" d="5340">It’s not an accident that the axiomatic western individual is someone</p>
<p t="2670880" d="5680">who was unfairly nailed to a cross and tortured, it’s like YES!</p>
<p t="2676560" d="3400">RIGHT! EXACTLY!</p>
<p t="2680840" d="2000">So what do you do about that?</p>
<p t="2683420" d="1100">well...</p>
<p t="2684880" d="2440">I thought about that for a long time too, it’s like</p>
<p t="2687760" d="2380">well you don’t get together in a damn mob</p>
<p t="2690840" d="6240">cause al that does is allow you to be as horrible as you can possibly imagine and suffer from none of the consequence</p>
<p t="2697080" d="3700">and tats a bad idea so how about we don’t do that.</p>
<p t="2701360" d="2980">Well there’s a deep idea in the west too it’s like</p>
<p t="2704340" d="2000">pick up your damn suffering</p>
<p t="2707040" d="1100">and bear it</p>
<p t="2709240" d="3160">And try to be a good person so you don’t make it worse!</p>
<p t="2714600" d="1800">well that&#39;s a truth</p>
<p t="2717560" d="2000">I read a lot about</p>
<p t="2719560" d="5180">Well that’s a truth! Y’know I’ve read a lot about the terrible tings that people have done to each other, you just cannot even imagine it</p>
<p t="2724740" d="2000">It’s so awful</p>
<p t="2728160" d="2000">So you don’t want to be someone like that</p>
<p t="2730420" d="2000">Now do you have a reason to be? Yes!</p>
<p t="2733320" d="6760">You have a lots of reasons to be! God there reasons to be resentful about your existence, everyone you know is gonna die</p>
<p t="2740080" d="2000">y&#39;know you too!</p>
<p t="2742080" d="6360">You too! And there’s gonna be a fair bit of pain along the way and lots of it gonna be unfair, it’s like yeah! No wonder you’re resentful</p>
<p t="2748540" d="2000">It’s like act it out and see what happens</p>
<p t="2751260" d="3440">You make everything you’re complaining about infinitely worse!</p>
<p t="2755520" d="4920">There’s this idea that hell is a bottomless pit and hats because no matter how bad it is some stupid</p>
<p t="2760440" d="4000">son of a bitch like you could figure out a way to make it a lot worse!</p>
<p t="2765100" d="3080">so you think well? What do you do about that?</p>
<p t="2768680" d="2760">Well you accept it! That’s what life is like</p>
<p t="2771440" d="6000">its suffering that’s what the religious people have always said life is suffering</p>
<p t="2777440" d="4360">yes! Well who wants to admit that? Well just think about it</p>
<p t="2782020" d="2400">Well so what do you do in the face of that suffering?</p>
<p t="2785700" d="1600">Try to reduce it!</p>
<p t="2788820" d="8260">Start with yourself, what good are you? Get yourself together for Christ’s sakes so that when your father dies you’re not whining away in a corner and you can help plan the funeral</p>
<p t="2797340" d="4740">and you can stand up solidly so people can rely on you. That’s better!</p>
<p t="2802160" d="5420">Don’t be a damn victim! Of course your victim! Jesus. Obviously!</p>
<p t="2808600" d="1700">put yourself together</p>
<p t="2810820" d="6740">Put yourself together and then maybe if you put yourself together-- you know how to do that, you know what’s wrong with you if you&#39;ll admit it. You know there&#39;s a few things you could like</p>
<p t="2817560" d="5860">polish up a little bit, that you might even be able to manage in your insufficient present condition</p>
<p t="2823420" d="6280">so you might shine yourself up a little bit, and then your eyes will be a little more open, and then you can shine yourself up a little bit more</p>
<p t="2829700" d="5520">and then maybe you could bring you family together instead of having them be the hateful, spiteful,</p>
<p t="2835220" d="5500">neurotic infighting batch that you&#39;re doomed to spend Christmas with.</p>
<p t="2840920" d="2000">(laughter)</p>
<p t="2843400" d="6300">So then you fix yourself up a little bit kinda humbly because y&#39;know god you’re a fixer upper if there ever was one</p>
<p t="2849980" d="9060">and then you gotta figure out well can you figure out how to make peace with your idiot brother and probably not because he’s just as dumb as you so how the hell are you gonna manage that</p>
<p t="2859440" d="7380">so then you maybe you get somewhere that way and your family’s sorta functioning an you find out well that kinda relieved a little bit of suffering although it</p>
<p t="2866820" d="4940">reduce the opportunities for spiteful revenge and that’s kind of a pain in the neck</p>
<p t="2871760" d="5780">so then you get your family together a little bit and you’re a little clued in then at least a bit cause</p>
<p t="2877540" d="7960">you’ve done something difficult that’s actually difficult your wiser so then maybe you can put a tentative finger out beyond the family</p>
<p t="2885500" d="3840">and try to change some little thing without wrecking it</p>
<p t="2889340" d="4620">Our society is complex and we teach our students that they could just fix it</p>
<p t="2894120" d="4100">It’s like go fix a military helicopter and see how far you get with that</p>
<p t="2898220" d="3220">It’s like what’re you gonna do you’re like a chimp with a wrench. Whack!</p>
<p t="2901440" d="4500">&quot;Oh look its better!&quot; No! It’s not better! Things are complicated and to fix things</p>
<p t="2905940" d="4840">is really hard and you have to be like a</p>
<p t="2911040" d="3180">a golden tool to fix things and you’re not</p>
<p t="2916480" d="2000">And that’s the other message of the west</p>
<p t="2919260" d="2440">How do you overcome to suffering of life?</p>
<p t="2922640" d="2340">(And I’m not saying it’s only the message of the west)</p>
<p t="2925880" d="3500">How do you overcome the suffering of life is be a better person!</p>
<p t="2930040" d="2500">That’s how you do it. Well that’s hard</p>
<p t="2933380" d="3860">it takes responsibility and I think if you said to someone</p>
<p t="2937240" d="6380">&quot;you want to have a meaningful life? Everything you do matters!&quot; that’s the definition of a meaningful life</p>
<p t="2943620" d="2000">But everything you do matters!</p>
<p t="2945880" d="2000">So you&#39;re gonna have to carry that with you</p>
<p t="2949160" d="3360">or do you wanna forget about the whole meaning thing, and</p>
<p t="2952760" d="7280">then you don’t have any responsibility because who the hell cares you can wander through life doing whatever you want gratifying impulsive desires</p>
<p t="2960040" d="2000">for how useful that’s going to be</p>
<p t="2962240" d="5020">And you’re stuck in meaninglessness but you don’t have any responsibility which one do you want?</p>
<p t="2967760" d="3500">Well, ask yourself: which one are you pursuing?</p>
<p t="2971340" d="6260">And you&#39;ll find very rapidly that it isn’t the majority of your soul that’s pursuing the whole meaning thing</p>
<p t="2977980" d="3060">because well look what you have to do to do that you</p>
<p t="2981040" d="5480">You have to take on the fact that life is suffering you have to put yourself together in the face of that</p>
<p t="2987220" d="3700">Well that’s hard! Christ its amazing people can even do it</p>
<p t="2990920" d="5940">I’m stunned every day when I go outside and it isn’t a riot with everything burning</p>
<p t="2996860" d="3220">(laughter) really! God! You talk to people its like</p>
<p t="3000620" d="8360">I knew this guy he&#39;d been in a motorcycle accident and it rally ruined him. He was a linesmen working on the power and he was working with someone who had Parkinson’s</p>
<p t="3008980" d="4300">disease and they had complimentary inadequacies</p>
<p t="3013280" d="6880">And so two of them could do the job of one person, so they&#39;re out there fixing power lines in the freezing cold despite</p>
<p t="3020160" d="5920">the fact that one was 3/4ths wrecked with a motorcycle accident and the other one had Parkinson’s</p>
<p t="3026080" d="5000">That’s how our civilization works! There’s all these ruined people out there they’ve got</p>
<p t="3031080" d="6240">problems like you can believe. Off they go to work and so things they don’t even like, and look! The lights are on!</p>
<p t="3037320" d="4780">My god! (LAUGHTER) It’s unbelievable it’s a miracle it’s a miracle</p>
<p t="3042100" d="5800">And we&#39;re so ungrateful! college students the post-modern types they&#39;re so ungrateful</p>
<p t="3048300" d="5780">y&#39;know they don’t know that there surrounded by just a bloody miracle it’s a miracle that all this stuff works</p>
<p t="3054080" d="6300">that all you crazy chimpanzees that don’t know each other can sit in the same room for two hours sweltering away</p>
<p t="3060380" d="3880">without tearing each other apart because that’s what chimps do!</p>
<p t="3067280" d="720">*exhales*</p>
<p t="3069520" d="2000">anyways so</p>
<p t="3072100" d="2100">what happened? Well I made some videos and</p>
<p t="3074340" d="5120">I got to the bottom of some things, at least as far as I can tell. so I told you what the bottom is and then I’ve</p>
<p t="3079460" d="3920">got this idea about what you might do about it which isn’t my idea</p>
<p t="3083380" d="5520">it’s not my idea it’s an old old old old idea its far older than Christianity</p>
<p t="3089060" d="2840">its old it’s the oldest story of mankind</p>
<p t="3093080" d="2000">get yourself together</p>
<p t="3095220" d="2000">transcend your suffering</p>
<p t="3097300" d="2000">see if you can be some kind of hero</p>
<p t="3100020" d="2000">make the suffering in the world less</p>
<p t="3103060" d="3780">Well that’s the way forward as far as I can tell if there is any way forward</p>
<p t="3107460" d="2500">and that’s what’s under assault by the post modernists</p>
<p t="3110760" d="4680">So look out cause they know exactly what they&#39;re doing and they know exactly why they’re doing it</p>
<p t="3115440" d="2000">and that’s what it looks like to me.</p>
<p t="3117980" d="3500">so, that&#39;s it!</p>
<p t="3122240" d="2000">(applause)</p>
