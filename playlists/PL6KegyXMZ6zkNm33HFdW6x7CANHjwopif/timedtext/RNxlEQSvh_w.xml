<p t="27260" d="5310">The last time we talked, I started to walk
you through the nervous system a little bit</p>
<p t="32570" d="5830">and we started with the monkey business illusion,
and one of the things that&#39;s really remarkable</p>
<p t="38400" d="5260">about the monkey business illusion is that--and
change blindness illusions in general--is</p>
<p t="43660" d="7340">that demonstrate to you just to what degree
you could either describe yourself as blind</p>
<p t="51000" d="1199">or focused.</p>
<p t="52199" d="3211">And I think focused is actually better than
blind.</p>
<p t="55410" d="4860">You know, a laser beam doesn&#39;t cover much
area, but it really illuminates what it strikes.</p>
<p t="60270" d="5630">And people are sort of like that, we&#39;re really
beamed into a single point and there&#39;s something</p>
<p t="65900" d="6740">metaphysically spectacular about that, I think,
because that single point that we&#39;re narrowed</p>
<p t="72640" d="5780">down to is in some sense the thing that writes
the world, you know, because as we interact</p>
<p t="78420" d="4629">with the world we&#39;re able to turn it one way
or another in all sorts of complicated ways.</p>
<p t="83049" d="5251">And, I mean, I know our powers of doing so
are obviously constrained to a substantial</p>
<p t="88300" d="6380">degree, but by the same token, that focal
point of concentration enables us to interact</p>
<p t="94680" d="7710">with the world and then, at least seemingly,
to change it according to our will.</p>
<p t="102390" d="3220">It&#39;s like we take a future that&#39;s potential,
we interact with it at a focal point, and</p>
<p t="105610" d="6000">then it transforms itself into a past that&#39;s
in some sense fixed and real.</p>
<p t="111610" d="2170">So that&#39;s pretty strange.</p>
<p t="113780" d="4090">So I guess you don&#39;t want to underestimate
the utility of a point.</p>
<p t="117870" d="6750">I want to talk to you a little bit first more
about what you&#39;re blind to and then what the</p>
<p t="124620" d="2480">consequences of that are.</p>
<p t="127100" d="9749">So, this here is a little diagram of a computer,
believe it or not--a conceptual diagram of</p>
<p t="136849" d="5881">a computer--and it&#39;s predicated on...</p>
<p t="142730" d="1670">I&#39;ll tell you a quick story.</p>
<p t="144400" d="5449">If I&#39;ve told you this story please stop me,
but I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve told you guys this</p>
<p t="149849" d="1140">story.</p>
<p t="150989" d="8941">So one day back in about 1987 I was working
on my computer and I was typing some long</p>
<p t="159930" d="5229">essay in DOS and, you really had to back up
in those days because the programs didn&#39;t</p>
<p t="165159" d="4580">do any back up for you and so if the program
shut off and you hadn&#39;t been super careful</p>
<p t="169739" d="1000">you were just going to lose all of it.</p>
<p t="170739" d="5241">And so that&#39;s what happened--I was typing
when the computer went off and so, I had an</p>
<p t="175980" d="2030">emotional reaction to that.</p>
<p t="178010" d="5369">Right, now an emotional reaction to that is
kind of an interesting event because, I would</p>
<p t="183379" d="5181">say that you&#39;re not even working with the
computer until it quits.</p>
<p t="188560" d="3120">And the reason I would say that is because,
if you think about it, when the computer is</p>
<p t="191680" d="5000">functioning the fact that it&#39;s an extraordinarily
complicated device is basically irrelevant</p>
<p t="196680" d="1000">to you.</p>
<p t="197680" d="4899">What you&#39;re working with, roughly speaking,
is the screen, but not really, not even the</p>
<p t="202579" d="1000">screen.</p>
<p t="203579" d="5550">You&#39;re working with maybe a phrase or even
the word that&#39;s presented on the screen.</p>
<p t="209129" d="8741">You know, you&#39;re typing the word/phrase/sentence/paragraph/essay,
and only out past that domain of consideration</p>
<p t="217870" d="4330">do you start thinking about the hardware technology
that underlies what you&#39;re doing.</p>
<p t="222200" d="2800">You don&#39;t want to think about that at all.</p>
<p t="225000" d="4139">When something&#39;s working, you don&#39;t have to
see it.</p>
<p t="229139" d="2791">And so that gives you a clue as to consciousness.</p>
<p t="231930" d="5690">Consciousness is an error detecting and correcting
phenomena, and you&#39;re not conscious of things</p>
<p t="237620" d="2750">that are going well.</p>
<p t="240370" d="3659">You know, which might explain to some degree
why a lot of our life seems to be made up</p>
<p t="244029" d="1240">of suffering.</p>
<p t="245269" d="5610">If things are going well, it isn&#39;t exactly
like you&#39;re happy if things are going well,</p>
<p t="250879" d="2481">you just don&#39;t notice when they&#39;re going well.</p>
<p t="253360" d="4190">Sometimes if they unexpectedly go well, then
that makes you happy.</p>
<p t="257550" d="6630">But otherwise it&#39;s just the same old thing,
even if it&#39;s amazing.</p>
<p t="264180" d="4030">I was--yesterday--I was eating breakfast with
my son and I was complaining about the fact</p>
<p t="268210" d="4459">that I had to eat canned-smoked tuna because
I don&#39;t really like fish, but I have to eat</p>
<p t="272669" d="2271">fish for a variety of different reasons.</p>
<p t="274940" d="2580">And I thought, Jesus, what&#39;re you complaining
about?</p>
<p t="277520" d="2899">I mean, really, do you know what a tuna is
like?</p>
<p t="280419" d="5251">Those things are like small whales, right;
they weigh like 600 pounds, they&#39;re impossible</p>
<p t="285670" d="1000">to catch.</p>
<p t="286670" d="5020">So there&#39;s some poor characters out there
hauling in tuna, which is impossible--and</p>
<p t="291690" d="2940">then they have to clean them and freeze them
and smoke them and can them--and all I have</p>
<p t="294630" d="3660">to do is go to the store and pick up this
can of tuna and then I can complain about</p>
<p t="298290" d="1870">it for breakfast.</p>
<p t="300160" d="7630">It&#39;s really quite staggering, the fact that
I can ever eat tuna is a complete bloody miracle.</p>
<p t="307790" d="4150">But it&#39;s not the sort of thing that makes
me happy because I just expect that.</p>
<p t="311940" d="3260">Which is very pathetic, but that&#39;s how it
goes.</p>
<p t="315200" d="2780">So anyways, back to the computer.</p>
<p t="317980" d="4960">So, it stops working--well, and that&#39;s what
I would say I notice the computer.</p>
<p t="322940" d="3440">And there&#39;s nothing more annoying then noticing
a computer when you&#39;re in the middle of writing</p>
<p t="326380" d="2840">an essay because, what the hell do you know
about computers?</p>
<p t="329220" d="1000">Nothing.</p>
<p t="330220" d="2480">What&#39;re you going to do?</p>
<p t="332700" d="1240">Turn it on and off?</p>
<p t="333940" d="4380">Well that&#39;s like problem solving process number
1.</p>
<p t="338320" d="5570">It usually works--thank god--but if it doesn&#39;t
work you&#39;re into either the software or the</p>
<p t="343890" d="1000">hardware.</p>
<p t="344890" d="4590">So anyways, I turned it on and off and that
didn&#39;t work, and so then I turned on a light</p>
<p t="349480" d="3660">to see if I could see if something had happened
at the back of it.</p>
<p t="353140" d="3840">But the light didn&#39;t go on so I thought, aha,
the power probably went out or I blew a fuse,</p>
<p t="356980" d="4450">so I went out to see if the fuse was burnt
out, but it wasn&#39;t.</p>
<p t="361430" d="3870">And then I noticed that all the power in the
house was off, and then I noticed that--I</p>
<p t="365300" d="3980">went outside to go to the corner store to
get something, I don&#39;t remember what, and</p>
<p t="369280" d="2531">when I went outside I noticed that all the
streetlights were off.</p>
<p t="371811" d="5149">And then the entire power grid in Montreal
was out.</p>
<p t="376960" d="3500">And then the entire power grid for like half
of Quebec was out.</p>
<p t="380460" d="2260">And a big chunk of Eastern North America.</p>
<p t="382720" d="1000">And do you know why?</p>
<p t="383720" d="2360">Have I told you this story?</p>
<p t="386080" d="1420">Good.</p>
<p t="387500" d="2590">Because there was a solar flare.</p>
<p t="390090" d="2530">And so the sun is a big hydrogen bomb, right.</p>
<p t="392620" d="3430">So I don&#39;t know if you guys know this--a cheerful
piece of information for you if you need to</p>
<p t="396050" d="4670">be cheered up--but if you happened to have
a hydrogen bomb and you exploded it--you know</p>
<p t="400720" d="5420">a hydrogen bomb has an atom bomb for its trigger,
did you guys know that?</p>
<p t="406140" d="1300">You need to know that because it&#39;s important.</p>
<p t="407440" d="5270">Because an atom bomb is a big thing, but it&#39;s
just a trigger for a hydrogen bomb, so a hydrogen</p>
<p t="412710" d="3740">bomb is unimaginably bigger than an atom bomb.</p>
<p t="416450" d="4450">Anyways, if you blew a hydrogen bomb in the
atmosphere over Central North America, you</p>
<p t="420900" d="7530">could probably wipe out maybe all of the electronic
equipment in the entire continent permanently.</p>
<p t="428430" d="4130">Because what happens is when a hydrogen bomb
goes off, there&#39;s an electromagnetic burst,</p>
<p t="432560" d="4720">and as the propagates it&#39;ll hit your electronic
equipment and propagate across the wires and</p>
<p t="437280" d="5060">produce a big spike in current, voltage I
think, and it&#39;ll just blow it.</p>
<p t="442340" d="4970">So your cars won&#39;t work, your tractors won&#39;t
work, your subways won&#39;t work, your cars won&#39;t</p>
<p t="447310" d="3330">work, your computers won&#39;t work, your satellites
won&#39;t work.</p>
<p t="450640" d="1390">It&#39;s like, done.</p>
<p t="452030" d="5560">And also, just to cheer you up even more,
back in the late 1800s, I think it was the</p>
<p t="457590" d="5990">1860s, there was this--oh let&#39;s go back to
the sun.</p>
<p t="463580" d="5700">So the sun&#39;s a big hydrogen bomb and now and
then it freaks out and emits a big solar flare,</p>
<p t="469280" d="2210">which is something that&#39;s gone wrong on the
sun.</p>
<p t="471490" d="9960">And maybe it blows out this solar flare almost
to the orbit of mercury, and then that burst</p>
<p t="481450" d="5120">of radiation comes zooming towards earth and
then 9 minutes later it hits and, if it&#39;s</p>
<p t="486570" d="4620">a decent electromagnetic pulse it&#39;ll wipe
out the power grid in Quebec.</p>
<p t="491190" d="1330">And that&#39;s what happened.</p>
<p t="492520" d="4610">So the reason my computer didn&#39;t work is because
the sun was misbehaving.</p>
<p t="497130" d="1650">And so, I like that.</p>
<p t="498780" d="4060">It was very illuminating to me because it
just shows you how many things need to be</p>
<p t="502840" d="5690">stacked on top of each other, working perfectly
for some thing that you&#39;re doing to actually</p>
<p t="508530" d="1000">function.</p>
<p t="509530" d="4889">So anyways, back in the late 1800s in the
1860s, there was a massive solar flare and</p>
<p t="514419" d="6591">it produced a bust of power on telegraph lines
and it lit some telegraph operators on fire.</p>
<p t="521010" d="3660">And so this does happen--it happens about
once a century, and we just missed one last</p>
<p t="524670" d="1030">year.</p>
<p t="525700" d="6310">So while you&#39;re worrying about global warming
you can be considering the much higher probability</p>
<p t="532010" d="3819">that a solar flare will knock out all of our
electronics and send us back to like 1860.</p>
<p t="535829" d="8331">So the point is that, first of all, there&#39;s
a lot of things going on to make up an object</p>
<p t="544160" d="1510">that you don&#39;t detect with your vision.</p>
<p t="545670" d="5870">You never think that the reason the computer
works is because the sun is acting properly.</p>
<p t="551540" d="5580">But it is of course the case that endless
number of things have to be stabilized that</p>
<p t="557120" d="1000">you don&#39;t see.</p>
<p t="558120" d="4470">And you might say, well the sun isn&#39;t part
of the computer but well, that&#39;s wrong.</p>
<p t="562590" d="4300">It&#39;s not part of the computer in some sense
when it&#39;s behaving, but as soon as it stops</p>
<p t="566890" d="2630">behaving it&#39;s instantly part of the computer.</p>
<p t="569520" d="6970">So here we&#39;ve got--you might say, well let&#39;s
say the power hadn&#39;t gone out and the computer</p>
<p t="576490" d="1000">stopped working.</p>
<p t="577490" d="5190">Well then you might think, well I&#39;ll never
buy that brand again.</p>
<p t="582680" d="8460">And maybe the brand is associated with operation
in some country where corruption is rife and</p>
<p t="591140" d="2560">things are made improperly and the parts don&#39;t
work very well.</p>
<p t="593700" d="2200">So you might think, well I made a stupid purchase
decision.</p>
<p t="595900" d="5440">And of course that&#39;s connected to the political
system of that place and the economy.</p>
<p t="601340" d="4710">And then weird little things can happen down
at the micro level as well as the macro level.</p>
<p t="606050" d="6600">So computer chips have now got so small--you
know they have little wires in them right,</p>
<p t="612650" d="3620">the chips--the wires are now so small that
because of quantum uncertainty.</p>
<p t="616270" d="4620">So quantum uncertainty basically tells you
that you can&#39;t really tell where an electron</p>
<p t="620890" d="2240">is if you want to know how fast it&#39;s going.</p>
<p t="623130" d="3190">And you can&#39;t tell how fast it&#39;s going if
you want to know where it is.</p>
<p t="626320" d="3970">But more than that it says you can&#39;t really
know where the thing is, and so what that</p>
<p t="630290" d="3400">means is that once you get your wire short
enough, some of the electrons might not be</p>
<p t="633690" d="4460">in the wires where they&#39;re supposed to be,
and they actually cause short circuits.</p>
<p t="638150" d="2020">So that&#39;s another issue.</p>
<p t="640170" d="3609">There&#39;s other levels of reality that are micro
levels that you can&#39;t detect at all.</p>
<p t="643779" d="4181">So there&#39;s macro levels that are way beyond
you, you know, political systems, economic</p>
<p t="647960" d="3840">systems, biological systems, physical systems
outside of that.</p>
<p t="651800" d="4120">And then there are these Microsystems layered
all the way down, and things can go wrong</p>
<p t="655920" d="5950">at any one of those levels and a lot of that
is invisible to us.</p>
<p t="661870" d="2770">The same thing happens when something goes
wrong with you.</p>
<p t="664640" d="3010">It&#39;s like, what&#39;s wrong with you?</p>
<p t="667650" d="3030">Maybe you&#39;re malfunctioning at the molecular
level.</p>
<p t="670680" d="2690">Your DNA isn&#39;t working properly so you get
cancer.</p>
<p t="673370" d="5710">Or maybe some virus which is even smaller
than the DNA comes in and takes up residence</p>
<p t="679080" d="2280">and that&#39;s really not so good.</p>
<p t="681360" d="4450">Or maybe you&#39;re eating something wrong and
you have an organ malfunction.</p>
<p t="685810" d="3530">Or maybe your family&#39;s screwed up and you&#39;re
stressed half to death and the reason they&#39;re</p>
<p t="689340" d="6720">screwed up is because you live in, let&#39;s say
a society that&#39;s not friendly to your particular</p>
<p t="696060" d="5310">immigrant type, and so the real reason that
you&#39;re sick is because of people&#39;s inability</p>
<p t="701370" d="1300">to get along with one another.</p>
<p t="702670" d="2380">And so on and so forth and so on.</p>
<p t="705050" d="3780">And so god only knows where you&#39;re supposed
to focus.</p>
<p t="708830" d="2790">But, focus we do.</p>
<p t="711620" d="7571">And one of the things that motivation allows
you to do is to figure out what you&#39;re going</p>
<p t="719191" d="1000">to focus on.</p>
<p t="720191" d="5459">Now you think, god, there&#39;s all these things
to focus on.</p>
<p t="725650" d="3620">There&#39;s an infinite number of things to focus
on.</p>
<p t="729270" d="6950">How in the world do you ever figure out how
to focus on anything?</p>
<p t="736220" d="7060">Well the answer to that is evolution, fundamentally.</p>
<p t="743280" d="2380">You can view evolution in the following way.</p>
<p t="745660" d="5470">You can kind of think about the background
of reality--I think the best way to think</p>
<p t="751130" d="5380">about it is as this interplay of patterns,
complex patterns sort of like music.</p>
<p t="756510" d="4650">And those patterns are always changing in
a sort of dynamic way, and they exist at multiple</p>
<p t="761160" d="2440">levels, just like complex music does.</p>
<p t="763600" d="6679">So then imagine that what you&#39;re trying to
do is to dance to the music, to align yourself</p>
<p t="770279" d="1000">to the music.</p>
<p t="771279" d="2801">And it keeps changing on you so, well, what
do you do?</p>
<p t="774080" d="4040">Well if you can change then you can change
the music.</p>
<p t="778120" d="2910">But if you can&#39;t change then that&#39;s it.</p>
<p t="781030" d="1160">You&#39;re not dancing anymore.</p>
<p t="782190" d="3560">Okay, so let&#39;s assume that there&#39;s two ways
of solving that problem.</p>
<p t="785750" d="2970">One way is just sheer number.</p>
<p t="788720" d="4580">You&#39;re a single celled organism or a mosquito
and you don&#39;t have that much neurocapacity</p>
<p t="793300" d="3870">for transformation and so you don&#39;t know what
the melody is going to be when you lay your</p>
<p t="797170" d="6169">eggs if you&#39;re a mosquito and so you produce
like a million eggs and some of them can dance</p>
<p t="803339" d="3771">to the current beat and the others can&#39;t,
and so they all die.</p>
<p t="807110" d="3750">And so that&#39;s what happens over the course
of evolution for a very very long time.</p>
<p t="810860" d="5979">The melody keeps changing and then what creatures
do is propagate a whole variety of variants</p>
<p t="816839" d="6481">of themselves, and in the case of small animals
or fish even or crayfish or that sort of thing,</p>
<p t="823320" d="5280">they just overproduce offspring like mad in
hope that one of them can dance to the current</p>
<p t="828600" d="1140">tune.</p>
<p t="829740" d="3780">And then you know, we get three and a half
billion years later, roughly speaking, here</p>
<p t="833520" d="3920">we all are and what we&#39;ve got is this dynamic
nervous system.</p>
<p t="837440" d="7550">And it enables us to take an external pattern
and map it to a neurological pattern, or multiple</p>
<p t="844990" d="5060">neurological patterns--because we can interpret
things, right--and then to output that to</p>
<p t="850050" d="1590">multiple behavioural patterns.</p>
<p t="851640" d="6080">And so in some sense, what we&#39;ve done is we&#39;re
internalised the process of evolutionary variation</p>
<p t="857720" d="1690">into ourselves.</p>
<p t="859410" d="4830">And the more complex, roughly speaking, the
more layers your nervous system has--imagine</p>
<p t="864240" d="5300">there&#39;s a pattern on your skin, and then that&#39;s
interpreted by a pattern of nerves, and then</p>
<p t="869540" d="4500">those nerves have an output, they&#39;re sensory
nerves we&#39;ll say, and then those have an output</p>
<p t="874040" d="2770">to motor nerves, and then those have an output
to muscles.</p>
<p t="876810" d="1730">That&#39;s you, roughly.</p>
<p t="878540" d="3090">You&#39;re maybe a four-layer thing in that regard.</p>
<p t="881630" d="5400">But then you grow all these extra layers of
neural tissue, so that the layers are hundreds</p>
<p t="887030" d="2420">of cells thick.</p>
<p t="889450" d="1000">Hundreds of layers thick.</p>
<p t="890450" d="5370">And then you can map a whole bunch of patterns
in the external world onto a whole bunch of</p>
<p t="895820" d="4220">patterns in the neural world and then onto
a whole bunch of patterns in the motor world,</p>
<p t="900040" d="3380">and so that makes you dynamically adaptable.</p>
<p t="903420" d="5130">But you learned all that through this incredibly
painful process of evolution which basically</p>
<p t="908550" d="6510">consisted of the death of like 99.999 percent
of everything that ever lived.</p>
<p t="915060" d="2740">Species and individuals alike.</p>
<p t="917800" d="3210">Now, why is that relevant?</p>
<p t="921010" d="2960">Well, how do you figure out how to focus in
on something?</p>
<p t="923970" d="7500">Well, a big part of that is actually--let&#39;s
see how we do it.</p>
<p t="931470" d="2640">Well first of all, what are you focusing in
on here?</p>
<p t="934110" d="3670">Well not poisonous snakes, and rampaging lions
and chimpanzees.</p>
<p t="937780" d="1820">Because they&#39;re not in here.</p>
<p t="939600" d="4600">And the reason they&#39;re not in here, roughly
speaking, is because you live in a culture</p>
<p t="944200" d="3550">that&#39;s very very highly advanced and it&#39;s
got walls like mad.</p>
<p t="947750" d="3250">This is a--Carcassonne I think, a French city,
medieval city.</p>
<p t="951000" d="1060">It still exists.</p>
<p t="952060" d="1170">Beautiful city.</p>
<p t="953230" d="2190">You see how the medieval people solved this
problem.</p>
<p t="955420" d="2050">It&#39;s like, well you can&#39;t deal with much.</p>
<p t="957470" d="1000">Well what do you do?</p>
<p t="958470" d="1809">Build some walls, keep a bunch of stuff out.</p>
<p t="960279" d="3881">You don&#39;t have to worry about the rampaging
barbarians then because they just can&#39;t get</p>
<p t="964160" d="1000">in.</p>
<p t="965160" d="4290">And so a lot of the reason that you can handle
the insane complexity of the world is because</p>
<p t="969450" d="1270">it&#39;s not even neurological.</p>
<p t="970720" d="3179">It has virtually nothing to do with your physiology.</p>
<p t="973899" d="5321">It&#39;s just that you&#39;re in a university.</p>
<p t="979220" d="4520">And the university is protected by the city
and the city is protected by the province</p>
<p t="983740" d="4400">and the province is protected by the country
and the country is protected by all of its</p>
<p t="988140" d="2740">multiple entanglements.</p>
<p t="990880" d="4070">You&#39;re inside walls inside walls inside walls
inside walls and so on.</p>
<p t="994950" d="1509">Your world&#39;s pretty simple.</p>
<p t="996459" d="4311">You can just sit there in relative warmth
and comfort and not have to worry about anything.</p>
<p t="1000770" d="3319">And so there&#39;s one solution: there&#39;s a cultural
solution.</p>
<p t="1004089" d="4461">Then inside the cultural solution obviously
there&#39;s architectural solutions of various</p>
<p t="1008550" d="1190">sorts.</p>
<p t="1009740" d="3860">And then there&#39;s political and economic institutions
that are pretty stable, and they keep you</p>
<p t="1013600" d="1739">from having to deal with chaos.</p>
<p t="1015339" d="5361">I mean you can see that chaos breaking out
a little bit in the previous weeks, in the</p>
<p t="1020700" d="1020">American election.</p>
<p t="1021720" d="4939">Because the trump people and the left wingers
are going at it at the Trump rallies.</p>
<p t="1026659" d="5650">And you can see that&#39;s just tinder, that could
just blow up at any point and all of that</p>
<p t="1032309" d="5220">protection that&#39;s there because all of these
very complex games that we&#39;ve agreed to play--like</p>
<p t="1037529" d="3810">the democracy game--that just all flies by
the wayside.</p>
<p t="1041339" d="3690">And all of a sudden you have to contend with
what people are like, and that is not something</p>
<p t="1045029" d="1331">you want to do.</p>
<p t="1046360" d="4419">There&#39;s people, man--they&#39;re capable of anything.</p>
<p t="1050779" d="2351">Which is good, but also really bad.</p>
<p t="1053130" d="3150">Well then the next thing is, you&#39;ve got a
body.</p>
<p t="1056280" d="2420">Now that&#39;s where the evolutionary process
really kicks in.</p>
<p t="1058700" d="7229">And so the reason your body is the way it
is, roughly speaking, is because it&#39;s mimicked</p>
<p t="1065929" d="1581">the external environment.</p>
<p t="1067510" d="5550">Just like Piaget talks about children using
their bodies to mimic the external environment</p>
<p t="1073060" d="6390">voluntarily, you know, your body is set up
through this evolutionary process so that</p>
<p t="1079450" d="4390">you can focus on precisely that subset of
things that seems to keep something like you</p>
<p t="1083840" d="4250">going for long enough for you to make another
one of something that&#39;s more or less like</p>
<p t="1088090" d="1300">you.</p>
<p t="1089390" d="3539">And it only really works for about a hundred
years.</p>
<p t="1092929" d="2191">That&#39;s pretty much where it tops out.</p>
<p t="1095120" d="2510">And so you don&#39;t solve the problem very well.</p>
<p t="1097630" d="4050">You don&#39;t solve the problem of radical complexity
very well.</p>
<p t="1101680" d="5330">But you solve it well enough so that you live
long enough to reproduce, speaking strictly</p>
<p t="1107010" d="1000">biologically.</p>
<p t="1108010" d="2140">And that appears to be good enough.</p>
<p t="1110150" d="5600">And part of the reason why you seem to expire,
because you might think, well if I--why don&#39;t</p>
<p t="1115750" d="3800">people just live for like 500 years instead
of 100 years?</p>
<p t="1119550" d="7320">Because you&#39;d think that someone who could
continue to reproduce for 200 years instead</p>
<p t="1126870" d="5060">of 100 years would have it all over for someone
who could only manage it for 50 years, say.</p>
<p t="1131930" d="5999">Turns out that your genes have a better time
of it if you just put them into a new body</p>
<p t="1137929" d="3752">and shuffle off this mortal coil so you&#39;re
not using up too many resources while your</p>
<p t="1141681" d="3669">children and grandchildren are trying to survive.</p>
<p t="1145350" d="4500">And so that&#39;s an evolutionary solution.</p>
<p t="1149850" d="2540">Death is not technically inevitable.</p>
<p t="1152390" d="2300">There are creatures that are roughly immortal.</p>
<p t="1154690" d="2700">Goldfish, for example, which is really annoying.</p>
<p t="1157390" d="1610">It&#39;s like, really?</p>
<p t="1159000" d="1000">Goldfish?</p>
<p t="1160000" d="3680">Because they&#39;re a carp and carp basically
just keep growing.</p>
<p t="1163680" d="5850">It isn&#39;t obvious that they senesce or age--they
get killed because they get diseases and these</p>
<p t="1169530" d="4810">sort of thing, but there are 300 or 400 year
old carp.</p>
<p t="1174340" d="3430">And some turtles seem to not age really.</p>
<p t="1177770" d="6880">And then of course your DNA has been there
ever since life started, so it doesn&#39;t really</p>
<p t="1184650" d="1230">age either.</p>
<p t="1185880" d="2020">And it corrects itself.</p>
<p t="1187900" d="2280">So things can last a very very long time.</p>
<p t="1190180" d="1700">But not us.</p>
<p t="1191880" d="5490">Anyways, we&#39;re put inside this body that frames
things for us and starts narrowing things</p>
<p t="1197370" d="1000">down.</p>
<p t="1198370" d="7230">And our psychophysiological selves have a
limited range of interests and desires and</p>
<p t="1205600" d="5010">needs--however you want to construe that--and
then that gets instantiated more into the</p>
<p t="1210610" d="2050">nervous system.</p>
<p t="1212660" d="3210">It&#39;s a mistake to think--people always think
your brain is in your head, and that&#39;s really</p>
<p t="1215870" d="1850">not a very bright way of thinking about it.</p>
<p t="1217720" d="4800">I don&#39;t know exactly why we think that way
because, well there&#39;s the nervous system--you</p>
<p t="1222520" d="2280">can see it right there.</p>
<p t="1224800" d="4379">There&#39;s a lot of your nervous system that&#39;s
not in your head.</p>
<p t="1229179" d="3421">The motor and sensory systems are distributed
throughout your body.</p>
<p t="1232600" d="5220">Your spine is smart enough so that if it gets
severed and we put you over top of a treadmill--suspend</p>
<p t="1237820" d="1580">you--you can walk.</p>
<p t="1239400" d="3370">You don&#39;t know you&#39;re walking and you can&#39;t
control it, but your legs will do a perfectly</p>
<p t="1242770" d="3340">good job of walking without you being involved
at all.</p>
<p t="1246110" d="3770">So your spine is brain tissue for all intents
and purposes.</p>
<p t="1249880" d="2880">Your brain is distributed through your body.</p>
<p t="1252760" d="7770">And so, it&#39;s evolved so that it&#39;s pretty good
at going around specifying what it needs.</p>
<p t="1260530" d="11400">And so we talked about the hypothalamus the
other day and how it accounts for what I called</p>
<p t="1271930" d="4050">sub-personalities that are motivated towards
particular ends.</p>
<p t="1275980" d="5450">And those ends are obviously the things that
we would identify as fundamental biological</p>
<p t="1281430" d="1930">necessities.</p>
<p t="1283360" d="6689">But then they transform themselves as we interact
socially into more and more complex fundamental</p>
<p t="1290049" d="3281">biological necessities.</p>
<p t="1293330" d="5120">It&#39;s a tricky thing because people talk about
needs as if they&#39;re biologically instantiated,</p>
<p t="1298450" d="3050">like they&#39;re the fundamental building elements
of motivation.</p>
<p t="1301500" d="6380">But it&#39;s not really that obvious, because
you might say, well being hungry is a biological</p>
<p t="1307880" d="2630">need but being a doctor isn&#39;t.</p>
<p t="1310510" d="5560">Well, not really because if you do end up
being a physician you pretty much solve the</p>
<p t="1316070" d="2760">food acquisition problem permanently, right.</p>
<p t="1318830" d="3680">So it&#39;s just a higher order manifestation
of the same thing.</p>
<p t="1322510" d="4419">And it&#39;s higher order because instead of just
eating once you eat every day for the next</p>
<p t="1326929" d="1000">40 years.</p>
<p t="1327929" d="3681">And instead of just feeding you, you feed
you and your family and maybe some other people</p>
<p t="1331610" d="1000">too.</p>
<p t="1332610" d="4520">So, thinking of that as something that isn&#39;t
rooted in biologically is not accurate.</p>
<p t="1337130" d="4750">It&#39;s kind of a continuous complexification.</p>
<p t="1341880" d="9630">From the simple local time-bound immature
subpersonalities that can only fulfill themselves</p>
<p t="1351510" d="5120">in this moment and with help, to the development
of those circuits--which I would say is your</p>
<p t="1356630" d="4870">personality--that are capable of providing
you with what you need in order to live and</p>
<p t="1361500" d="3320">to be attracted to other people across very
large spans of time.</p>
<p t="1364820" d="1140">It&#39;s like a tree, you know.</p>
<p t="1365960" d="2250">It&#39;s a like a tree expanding upward.</p>
<p t="1368210" d="3480">It&#39;s a good metaphor.</p>
<p t="1371690" d="3280">Alright, so that&#39;s fine.</p>
<p t="1374970" d="3270">Motivation sets up your perceptual frame.</p>
<p t="1378240" d="5580">And so people often talk about motivation
as if it&#39;s a drive or a need--not as if those</p>
<p t="1383820" d="2050">terms are particularly well-defined.</p>
<p t="1385870" d="5850">A drive I suppose is a deterministic sequence
of motor outputs, something like that.</p>
<p t="1391720" d="6589">But it&#39;s not accurate because the motivation
actually specifies what you look at.</p>
<p t="1398309" d="3500">It specifies right what you see.</p>
<p t="1401809" d="5571">And then it specifies as well what you&#39;re
going to respond to emotionally.</p>
<p t="1407380" d="6620">So just imagine this, say I&#39;d offered a 10,000
dollar prize to the person who counts the</p>
<p t="1414000" d="2610">number of basketballs correctly.</p>
<p t="1416610" d="4730">And then you&#39;re doing your best to count the
number of basketballs in the monkey illusion</p>
<p t="1421340" d="4160">and then somebody stands up in front of you
like this, and blocks your view.</p>
<p t="1425500" d="3170">Well what emotion are you going to feel?</p>
<p t="1428670" d="2259">It&#39;s a negative emotion, right?</p>
<p t="1430929" d="1000">In all likelihood.</p>
<p t="1431929" d="3711">And so that might be anxiety, because you&#39;re
not going to win.</p>
<p t="1435640" d="5560">It might be fear--it&#39;s like anxiety because
you&#39;re not going to win, but also like--fear</p>
<p t="1441200" d="3280">because what the hell is this crazy person
doing.</p>
<p t="1444480" d="1000">Anger.</p>
<p t="1445480" d="4860">Right, that&#39;s another negative emotion, although
there&#39;s a positive attack element to it.</p>
<p t="1450340" d="7250">Frustration, disappointment, maybe some grief--a
whole undifferentiated mess of negative emotions.</p>
<p t="1457590" d="1000">Well why?</p>
<p t="1458590" d="8890">Well, in some sense the motivational system
specifies the map and the goal.</p>
<p t="1467480" d="2970">It&#39;s a little more complicated than that because
it also specifies where you are.</p>
<p t="1470450" d="2960">But you can think about it as a map with a
destination.</p>
<p t="1473410" d="4519">That&#39;s why stories are like that, because
we inhabit them.</p>
<p t="1477929" d="1941">A map&#39;s like that all the time.</p>
<p t="1479870" d="6130">And then what emotions do, roughly speaking,
is tell you whether or not things are going</p>
<p t="1486000" d="3380">the way you want them to as you&#39;re on that
path.</p>
<p t="1489380" d="8150">And so the emotions in some sense have to
have a motivational specification before they&#39;re</p>
<p t="1497530" d="1000">properly functional.</p>
<p t="1498530" d="2000">Like, what should you get angry at.</p>
<p t="1500530" d="4860">Well generally you get angry at things that
either interfere with your progression towards</p>
<p t="1505390" d="8320">a valued goal or upset the entire sub-personality
that contains the goal itself.</p>
<p t="1513710" d="7839">That&#39;s a more--what could you call it--that&#39;s
a more serious failure.</p>
<p t="1521549" d="3870">It&#39;s one to fail when you&#39;re trying to do
something, it&#39;s another thing to fail so hard</p>
<p t="1525419" d="2171">you have to give up the whole project.</p>
<p t="1527590" d="3940">We would rather just fail at some sub-element
than have to give up the whole project, right.</p>
<p t="1531530" d="5630">It&#39;s one thing to fail an exam, it&#39;s another
thing to fail at university.</p>
<p t="1537160" d="5250">And I think the reason for that--I thought
about that for a long time--why is it worse</p>
<p t="1542410" d="3900">to fail out of university, assuming you want
to be in university, than it is to fail an</p>
<p t="1546310" d="1000">exam?</p>
<p t="1547310" d="2270">How does your brain compute that?</p>
<p t="1549580" d="4070">Because you can&#39;t tell all the consequences,
right, so it&#39;s not self evident.</p>
<p t="1553650" d="8350">But it seems to me that it&#39;s something like,
you think about these functional sub-personalities</p>
<p t="1562000" d="6670">as having a temporal and spatial range of
application.</p>
<p t="1568670" d="4060">So if you&#39;re a university student you&#39;re sort
of stabilized for four years.</p>
<p t="1572730" d="4559">Wherever you go, people say &quot;what do you do?&quot;
and you can say &quot;I'm a university student.&quot;</p>
<p t="1577289" d="4061">And everybody&#39;s happy about that.</p>
<p t="1581350" d="6030">From an economic perspective it&#39;s probably
worse than being unemployed, in some sense,</p>
<p t="1587380" d="4030">but you can&#39;t just go tell people that you&#39;re
unemployed and then you have a nice little</p>
<p t="1591410" d="1509">high-status slot in society.</p>
<p t="1592919" d="1000">It doesn&#39;t work that way.</p>
<p t="1593919" d="3851">But you can do that as a university student,
you know, so it fulfills your social obligations</p>
<p t="1597770" d="5480">and it makes you feel like you&#39;re doing something
at least vaguely useful--I mean apart from</p>
<p t="1603250" d="2240">the learning and all the other things that
are positive about it.</p>
<p t="1605490" d="6380">So what happens is that that map basically
covers that space and time--the time is four</p>
<p t="1611870" d="3240">years and the space is everywhere you go during
those four years.</p>
<p t="1615110" d="5800">Then if that map burns up it&#39;s like you&#39;re
exposed on all fronts for that entire four</p>
<p t="1620910" d="1000">year period.</p>
<p t="1621910" d="3870">And that might even be the two years previously.</p>
<p t="1625780" d="5310">For example--strange to think that, but if
you bail out of university half way through</p>
<p t="1631090" d="7410">your third year, you&#39;ve also destructured
the map that you used to organize your memories,</p>
<p t="1638500" d="2630">in some sense, of the previous two and a half
years.</p>
<p t="1641130" d="3610">Because first of all they were the memories
of somewone who was doing just fine and going</p>
<p t="1644740" d="3530">through university, and now all of a sudden
they&#39;re the memories of someone who failed.</p>
<p t="1648270" d="2080">Those aren&#39;t the same memories.</p>
<p t="1650350" d="8610">And so it&#39;s weird that an error can alter
the past, but it can and often does.</p>
<p t="1658960" d="4780">I mean any relationship breakup that&#39;s of
any significance will do exactly the same</p>
<p t="1663740" d="2100">thing, especially if you were betrayed, right.</p>
<p t="1665840" d="4949">It&#39;s like, it&#39;s not just the present and the
future that dissolve into chaos and take you</p>
<p t="1670789" d="1640">on a little trip to the underworld.</p>
<p t="1672429" d="5641">It&#39;s also your revision--the necessity of
revising your past.</p>
<p t="1678070" d="5099">So anyways, so then I would say well--failing
a class--well the class restructures you in</p>
<p t="1683169" d="5031">some sense and focuses you for a certain subset
of the general going-to-university map.</p>
<p t="1688200" d="5890">So it&#39;s going to be less traumatizing to do
poorly on a class than it is to fail out of</p>
<p t="1694090" d="7170">university because the amount of space and
time that those respective maps covers differs.</p>
<p t="1701260" d="6740">So what you&#39;re trying to do always is to lay
out a functional game--that&#39;s a good way of</p>
<p t="1708000" d="3309">thinking about it--on the space-time territory
that you inhabit.</p>
<p t="1711309" d="5651">And if you understand that then you can start
to understand a little bit about emotions.</p>
<p t="1716960" d="8790">Now, okay, I have to put a little coda in
there and that&#39;s: motivations and emotions</p>
<p t="1725750" d="2250">are not technical terms.</p>
<p t="1728000" d="2100">They&#39;re sort of like id and ego.</p>
<p t="1730100" d="4150">They&#39;re terms that you can use to structure
a debate.</p>
<p t="1734250" d="3170">I showed you the hypothalamus and you see
it&#39;s made out of all those little nuclei--they&#39;re</p>
<p t="1737420" d="3950">not the same, so you can&#39;t say that every
part of the hypothalamus is doing something</p>
<p t="1741370" d="3510">that you can fit into a class: motivation.</p>
<p t="1744880" d="7470">And motivations and emotions overlap, so,
I would say hunger--some of them oversee more</p>
<p t="1752350" d="3100">purely motivation.</p>
<p t="1755450" d="5859">If you have an unsettling altercation with
someone, it tends not to make you hungry.</p>
<p t="1761309" d="5600">Whereas it might make you angry, it might
make you happy, it might make you sad.</p>
<p t="1766909" d="5211">So hunger is something that seems to pop up
one of these maps and then emotions guide</p>
<p t="1772120" d="2980">your way through it or tell you where you
are on it.</p>
<p t="1775100" d="6500">But then you have complex motivation-emotions
like pain, and also anger.</p>
<p t="1781600" d="3540">Because pain has a goal in it, right--get
away.</p>
<p t="1785140" d="5169">Or stop, or get away--it&#39;s usually get away--but
it also has an emotional feeling, right.</p>
<p t="1790309" d="1480">It feels bad.</p>
<p t="1791789" d="2770">So it feels like an emotion, pain.</p>
<p t="1794559" d="2110">Grief is like pain.</p>
<p t="1796669" d="1821">Disappointment is like pain.</p>
<p t="1798490" d="3280">Loneliness is like pain.</p>
<p t="1801770" d="4090">And I mean this technically--all of those
things can be addressed rather successfully</p>
<p t="1805860" d="1490">with opiates, by the way.</p>
<p t="1807350" d="1900">So technically they&#39;re the same.</p>
<p t="1809250" d="3780">But pain--is being hurt an emotion?</p>
<p t="1813030" d="3330">Well people will say that, &quot;well I feel hurt.&quot;</p>
<p t="1816360" d="1000">Whatever.</p>
<p t="1817360" d="7140">And anger is another one of those that&#39;s sort
of ambivalent because anger has a goal, right:</p>
<p t="1824500" d="1780">remove obstacle.</p>
<p t="1826280" d="1080">Remove or destroy obstacle.</p>
<p t="1827360" d="2070">In a sense, that&#39;s the goal of anger.</p>
<p t="1829430" d="2859">But people talk about it as an emotion.</p>
<p t="1832289" d="2231">So we&#39;re oversimplifying.</p>
<p t="1834520" d="4670">But it doesn&#39;t matter because it&#39;s a useful
oversimplification and that&#39;s sort of what</p>
<p t="1839190" d="2170">a theory is: a useful oversimplification.</p>
<p t="1841360" d="8439">Alright, so 
I kind of laid out what I think are the basic</p>
<p t="1849799" d="2031">motivations there.</p>
<p t="1851830" d="8310">Hunger, thirst, pain, anger, thermoregulation--you
don&#39;t want to be too hot or too cold--panic</p>
<p t="1860140" d="7340">or escape, affiliation or care, sexual desire,
exploration, play.</p>
<p t="1867480" d="5429">And you can kind of divide those into self-maintenance
motivations and self-propagation motivations,</p>
<p t="1872909" d="2201">roughly speaking.</p>
<p t="1875110" d="1740">Sort of just a way to keep track of them.</p>
<p t="1876850" d="3220">And then emotions--so the hypothalamus is
involved in a lot of that.</p>
<p t="1880070" d="4520">It&#39;s not the only thing but it&#39;s involved
in a lot of that.</p>
<p t="1884590" d="3200">And so here&#39;s sort of how I&#39;ve conceptualized
one of these maps.</p>
<p t="1887790" d="2050">And we&#39;ve seen this thing before.</p>
<p t="1889840" d="5560">You&#39;re at point A because if you&#39;re using
a map, or if you&#39;re in a game, there&#39;s a starting</p>
<p t="1895400" d="5170">point or you&#39;re a player--either way there&#39;s
you there--and then you&#39;re going somewhere</p>
<p t="1900570" d="1839">and you have to do something to get there.</p>
<p t="1902409" d="2971">Okay, so that&#39;s the little map, and maybe
you have to go make a peanut butter sandwich</p>
<p t="1905380" d="4029">or you have to go turn the thermostat down
or you need to call your friend or whatever.</p>
<p t="1909409" d="5661">But it&#39;s the same kind of structure that you&#39;re
using in all those different situations.</p>
<p t="1915070" d="1729">And they switch, you know.</p>
<p t="1916799" d="1880">Now you&#39;re finished being hungry.</p>
<p t="1918679" d="1870">Now you&#39;re thirsty.</p>
<p t="1920549" d="1870">Then you&#39;re lonesome.</p>
<p t="1922419" d="1481">It&#39;s like Sisyphus.</p>
<p t="1923900" d="3529">It&#39;s one damn thing after another, roughly
speaking.</p>
<p t="1927429" d="1531">And so that&#39;s what keeps you alive.</p>
<p t="1928960" d="4030">And you have to be chasing things all the
time because your natural tendency is to run</p>
<p t="1932990" d="2170">out of fuel and decay.</p>
<p t="1935160" d="2019">That&#39;s entropy--you have to fight that.</p>
<p t="1937179" d="4130">And so that&#39;s a continual battle because you&#39;re
pretty organized and it&#39;s really hard for</p>
<p t="1941309" d="4081">something that organized to just stay organized.</p>
<p t="1945390" d="3440">It&#39;s a lot easier--there&#39;s a million ways
to mess up your room.</p>
<p t="1948830" d="1510">There&#39;s like one way to clean it.</p>
<p t="1950340" d="3000">Or maybe 10, you get the point.</p>
<p t="1953340" d="3670">And it&#39;s the same with anything that&#39;s extraordinarily
complex.</p>
<p t="1957010" d="4760">There&#39;s not that many ways it can stay in
order and there&#39;s a lot of ways it can fall</p>
<p t="1961770" d="1000">apart.</p>
<p t="1962770" d="1170">That&#39;s why you&#39;re running all the time on
a treadmill.</p>
<p t="1963940" d="3420">You&#39;re fighting the second--is it the second
law of thermodynamics.</p>
<p t="1967360" d="1880">Is entropy the second law of thermodynamics?</p>
<p t="1969240" d="1220">I think so.</p>
<p t="1970460" d="3949">That&#39;s a major one, so good luck in your scrap.</p>
<p t="1974409" d="6341">Because you&#39;re going to need it.</p>
<p t="1980750" d="5820">So these little underlying biological systems
pop up the primary maps and then those are</p>
<p t="1986570" d="2960">elaborated upwards into maps that are more
and more complicated.</p>
<p t="1989530" d="3910">And the more and more complicated maps maybe
solve two problems at the same time for a</p>
<p t="1993440" d="1000">week.</p>
<p t="1994440" d="3089">Or they solve 10 problems at the same time
for 20 years.</p>
<p t="1997529" d="6171">That&#39;s why you want a job or a career: a whole
bunch of problems are solved immediately as</p>
<p t="2003700" d="1810">soon as you&#39;re employed.</p>
<p t="2005510" d="6049">I mean, you have some other problems, but
that&#39;s inescapable anyways.</p>
<p t="2011559" d="3001">Okay so you&#39;re inside one of these so you&#39;re
always motivated.</p>
<p t="2014560" d="1780">You&#39;re always running around after something.</p>
<p t="2016340" d="5870">And that&#39;s another thing to know too because
the basic state of human beings is not quiescence,</p>
<p t="2022210" d="1000">you know.</p>
<p t="2023210" d="2650">You&#39;re not napping in front of a fireplace.</p>
<p t="2025860" d="4850">If you&#39;re not pursuing something that you&#39;re
motivated to pursue, then generally what you&#39;re</p>
<p t="2030710" d="4240">doing if figuring out how to pursue other
things that you&#39;re motivated to pursue.</p>
<p t="2034950" d="1000">And that&#39;s exploration.</p>
<p t="2035950" d="6050">And so if you&#39;re not actively motivated by
biological necessity, we&#39;ll say for the sake</p>
<p t="2042000" d="5880">of simplicity, then the next motivation kicks
in, which is well, prepare for the next time</p>
<p t="2047880" d="1940">that you are so motivated.</p>
<p t="2049820" d="2309">And that really accounts for our capacity
to explore.</p>
<p t="2052129" d="4231">We&#39;re always zooming around the world trying
to figure out what to do with it next, you</p>
<p t="2056360" d="1000">know.</p>
<p t="2057360" d="4069">Acquiring more information or--even when we&#39;re
entertaining ourselves because we&#39;re almost</p>
<p t="2061429" d="2410">always looking at stories when we entertain
ourselves.</p>
<p t="2063839" d="5010">We&#39;re still acquiring information that has
functional significance and so attractive</p>
<p t="2068849" d="5270">to us that we find it innately rewarding just
to observe that sort of thing.</p>
<p t="2074119" d="4731">It&#39;s even in strange situations, like people
will go to horror movies.</p>
<p t="2078850" d="1000">What&#39;s wrong with them?</p>
<p t="2079850" d="2460">Why do you want to go and get scared?</p>
<p t="2082310" d="1000">Or disgusted?</p>
<p t="2083310" d="3619">Because that&#39;s horror, right--fear and disgust.</p>
<p t="2086929" d="3611">Plain uncertainty horror movies like The Blair
Witch Project, that&#39;s pretty much all fear.</p>
<p t="2090540" d="4540">And then the slasher movies and that sort
of thing, that&#39;s pretty much all disgust.</p>
<p t="2095080" d="3330">And you might say, well why bother exposing
yourself to that.</p>
<p t="2098410" d="4050">And part of it is: to get over it.</p>
<p t="2102460" d="1340">You know, it&#39;s exposure.</p>
<p t="2103800" d="4940">Because life has terrifying elements and it
has disgusting elements, and you&#39;re going</p>
<p t="2108740" d="6090">to have to learn to maintain yourself in the
face of that.</p>
<p t="2114830" d="6019">Certainly illness is going to challenge your
capacity to deal with disgust.</p>
<p t="2120849" d="6811">There&#39;s any number of reasons to be terrified
so, you go to movies and you practice facing</p>
<p t="2127660" d="1000">it.</p>
<p t="2128660" d="1060">And you observe that you can.</p>
<p t="2129720" d="5310">I mean there&#39;s other motivations too, but
those are sort of the healthy ones that go</p>
<p t="2135030" d="4450">along with people wanting to expose themselves
to dangerous situations.</p>
<p t="2139480" d="4850">So even in that you see exploration and preparation
for what&#39;s going to happen next.</p>
<p t="2144330" d="3140">And the exploratory circuit is a very very
fundamental circuit.</p>
<p t="2147470" d="1710">It&#39;s also hypothalamically mediated.</p>
<p t="2149180" d="6490">So, the way the hypothalamus works--it&#39;s quite
cool--is that, on one hand it pops up all</p>
<p t="2155670" d="5010">these little maps that you can occupy that
have their core in, we&#39;ll say, biological</p>
<p t="2160680" d="5360">necessity--so roughly Freud&#39;s id--but when
those things all shut down because they&#39;re</p>
<p t="2166040" d="6730">satiated, that&#39;s a technical term by the way--satiated,
it means satisfied--it&#39;s a form of reward.</p>
<p t="2172770" d="6910">So it&#39;s sort of how you feel after you&#39;ve
eaten a good meal and you&#39;re in a warm room</p>
<p t="2179680" d="5360">and your friends are around you and maybe
you go to sleep if it&#39;s your family.</p>
<p t="2185040" d="6299">Because--I&#39;m thinking of thanksgiving or something
like that--everything is just taken care of</p>
<p t="2191339" d="1791">and so you fall asleep.</p>
<p t="2193130" d="1740">That&#39;s satiation.</p>
<p t="2194870" d="3620">You can see that in animals all the time because
they spend a lot of time satiated.</p>
<p t="2198490" d="1010">Dogs: they sleep a lot.</p>
<p t="2199500" d="1500">Cats: they sleep a lot.</p>
<p t="2201000" d="5180">Because they&#39;ve already attacked their cat
food and so that&#39;s pretty much it for the</p>
<p t="2206180" d="1050">day.</p>
<p t="2207230" d="5400">Human beings, we tend not so much to enter
into states of satiation.</p>
<p t="2212630" d="8390">Now what happens when you&#39;re in one of those
little units--one of those little motivated</p>
<p t="2221020" d="4020">things--there&#39;s a couple of things that can
happen.</p>
<p t="2225040" d="2290">[Muttering].</p>
<p t="2227330" d="34670">Okay so we talked about motivations as sort
of setting up this little frame.</p>
<p t="2262000" d="2660">And then we can talk about emotions.</p>
<p t="2264660" d="6050">So, there you are going somewhere.</p>
<p t="2270710" d="4330">And there&#39;s this little straight line that&#39;ll
take you there, this nice efficient way to</p>
<p t="2275040" d="1170">get there.</p>
<p t="2276210" d="1870">Now why do you want to do it efficiently?</p>
<p t="2278080" d="5010">Well, because you use up the least amount
of resources like that so you can maintain</p>
<p t="2283090" d="3390">some resources for doing the next thing you
need to do.</p>
<p t="2286480" d="2000">So you care about efficiency and simplicity.</p>
<p t="2288480" d="3510">So you want to go like the crow flies to the
destination.</p>
<p t="2291990" d="3080">So then, what happens along the way?</p>
<p t="2295070" d="4190">Well, let&#39;s say you just get to go straight.</p>
<p t="2299260" d="4520">Well basically what happens is that you&#39;re
motivated by your perception of the goal or</p>
<p t="2303780" d="5210">intermediary goals because the goal can be
linked together, and then as long as things</p>
<p t="2308990" d="5950">are going according to plan, as you move towards
the goal in an untrammelled way you&#39;re going</p>
<p t="2314940" d="1720">to feel mild positive emotion.</p>
<p t="2316660" d="5760">And the reason for that is that you&#39;re turning
the environment--the environment almost never</p>
<p t="2322420" d="1520">has...</p>
<p t="2323940" d="1590">most of it (the environment) is irrelevant.</p>
<p t="2325530" d="2670">The rest of it has a positive or negative
valence.</p>
<p t="2328200" d="5030">And if things are going according to plan
it has a mild positive valence, right.</p>
<p t="2333230" d="4160">You think things are okay, and really what
you&#39;re doing is you&#39;re observing two things.</p>
<p t="2337390" d="5170">You&#39;re observing that the things that should
be happening, if you know what you&#39;re doing</p>
<p t="2342560" d="3220">while you&#39;re acting, are happening.</p>
<p t="2345780" d="6579">And so each step forward is an indication
that you&#39;re getting closer to your goal.</p>
<p t="2352359" d="3821">That&#39;s incentive reward.</p>
<p t="2356180" d="3360">And that&#39;s the sort of reward that you actually
think of as fun.</p>
<p t="2359540" d="5530">An incentive reward is produced by activation
of the exploratory system that&#39;s in the hypothalamus--it</p>
<p t="2365070" d="4190">has its roots in the hypothalamus--and that&#39;s
the dopaminergic system.</p>
<p t="2369260" d="3620">And that&#39;s the system that cocaine and amphetamines
and all those drugs that people really like</p>
<p t="2372880" d="4920">to take hyperactivates, making them feel like
they&#39;re doing something important and useful.</p>
<p t="2377800" d="2770">Even though, in all likelihood, they&#39;re not.</p>
<p t="2380570" d="4060">So the dopaminergic drugs in some sense hijack
your incentive reward systems.</p>
<p t="2384630" d="4830">And it&#39;s incentive reward because you&#39;re incentivized
to continue moving forward.</p>
<p t="2389460" d="6180">Anything that you look at that makes you want
to touch it or move forward to it basically</p>
<p t="2395640" d="3850">activates the dopaminergic system.</p>
<p t="2399490" d="6200">Now, so you say, well what happens when you&#39;re
on your way to somewhere.</p>
<p t="2405690" d="4849">Well, roughly what happens is neutral things,
which is okay.</p>
<p t="2410539" d="1201">You can ignore them.</p>
<p t="2411740" d="1790">Positive things or negative things.</p>
<p t="2413530" d="3970">Positive things happen when things are going
according to plan or even better than according</p>
<p t="2417500" d="1000">to plan.</p>
<p t="2418500" d="3570">You&#39;re walking to school, it&#39;s raining, somebody
you know stops and offers you a life.</p>
<p t="2422070" d="3700">It&#39;s like, well you&#39;re doing okay getting
to school and that was fine, but all of a</p>
<p t="2425770" d="2680">sudden you&#39;re getting there a little faster
and you&#39;re not getting wet.</p>
<p t="2428450" d="2010">So that cheers you up.</p>
<p t="2430460" d="4780">It&#39;s an indication that you&#39;re able to save
resources while you&#39;re moving towards a goal--dopaminergically</p>
<p t="2435240" d="1000">mediated.</p>
<p t="2436240" d="4481">You know, and then we can imagine a different
scenario where you&#39;re walking to school in</p>
<p t="2440721" d="4378">the rain and someone drives by you, maybe
it&#39;s even the same friend, and they don&#39;t</p>
<p t="2445099" d="3591">see you and there&#39;s a puddle right beside
you and not only do they not stop but they</p>
<p t="2448690" d="5530">completely cover you with oily and frigid
water, and so that&#39;s not so good.</p>
<p t="2454220" d="3970">You&#39;re angry about that and upset.</p>
<p t="2458190" d="1440">Why?</p>
<p t="2459630" d="2860">Well, you might say, &quot;my day is ruined.&quot;</p>
<p t="2462490" d="1860">What does that mean exactly?</p>
<p t="2464350" d="5060">Well it means that you had a little map on
top of your day and you were hoping that the</p>
<p t="2469410" d="3660">day and the map would correspond, and then
all of a sudden the map burned up and god</p>
<p t="2473070" d="2450">only knows what&#39;s going to happen to the day.</p>
<p t="2475520" d="3460">And so it&#39;s like the bottom has dropped out
of your map.</p>
<p t="2478980" d="3450">And so then you have to worry about your clothes
and catching cold and all those things.</p>
<p t="2482430" d="3840">And turning around and going home and what
it&#39;ll mean if you miss class and so on and</p>
<p t="2486270" d="1000">so forth.</p>
<p t="2487270" d="3280">So basically that&#39;s the domain of chaos that
we talked about.</p>
<p t="2490550" d="4520">So that&#39;s a negative thing, but it&#39;s also--the
thing about negative things is they&#39;re sort</p>
<p t="2495070" d="3670">of hard to disentangle from unexpected things.</p>
<p t="2498740" d="3560">You know, because most of the things that
happen to you that are negative are also unexpected</p>
<p t="2502300" d="4549">because you don&#39;t go around trying to make
negative things happen.</p>
<p t="2506849" d="5231">So well, what happens when something negative
happens?</p>
<p t="2512080" d="2350">Well, you get a negative emotion.</p>
<p t="2514430" d="3830">Pain, anxiety, disgust.</p>
<p t="2518260" d="3450">Those seem to be the big three.</p>
<p t="2521710" d="2170">And they&#39;re mediated by different systems.</p>
<p t="2523880" d="2699">We don&#39;t understand the disgust system very
well.</p>
<p t="2526579" d="6341">It doesn&#39;t load with neuroticism because all
the other negative emotions load with trait</p>
<p t="2532920" d="1000">neuroticism.</p>
<p t="2533920" d="5120">Pain--pain seems to be what you experience
if your receptive surfaces are--you know if</p>
<p t="2539040" d="7549">your physiological self is subject to stimulation
of an intensity that&#39;s sufficient either to</p>
<p t="2546589" d="3750">damage it or to damage the receptors.</p>
<p t="2550339" d="1951">You know, but pain is complicated.</p>
<p t="2552290" d="3130">It&#39;s not just physical pain from physical
damage.</p>
<p t="2555420" d="3510">It depends on how you define physical damage.</p>
<p t="2558930" d="4780">If someone dies, that&#39;s pain.</p>
<p t="2563710" d="2510">If you&#39;re alone and isolated, that&#39;s pain.</p>
<p t="2566220" d="2780">If you&#39;re depressed, that&#39;s pain.</p>
<p t="2569000" d="4210">If you&#39;re frustrated or disappointed, that&#39;s
pain.</p>
<p t="2573210" d="4060">Frustrated might mean something gets in the
way of you moving towards a goal, and disappointment</p>
<p t="2577270" d="3500">might mean the whole damn structure just collapsed
on you.</p>
<p t="2580770" d="2790">Either way, that&#39;s pain.</p>
<p t="2583560" d="5519">Now the behaviourists would have called that
an unconditioned--like a painful stimulus--they</p>
<p t="2589079" d="2051">would&#39;ve called that an unconditioned stimulus.</p>
<p t="2591130" d="3620">You don&#39;t have to learn for it to be bad.</p>
<p t="2594750" d="2180">It&#39;s sort of built in bad.</p>
<p t="2596930" d="5360">And they would think about anxiety in response
to the unexpected as learned.</p>
<p t="2602290" d="7880">The behaviourists would think that you need
to learn what predicts something painful.</p>
<p t="2610170" d="4230">And if you learn that something predicts something
painful then you get anxious to it or afraid</p>
<p t="2614400" d="3150">of it.</p>
<p t="2617550" d="2450">But it turns out that it&#39;s more complicated
than that.</p>
<p t="2620000" d="4640">So what the behaviourists would think is that
pain in some sense is the fundamental negative</p>
<p t="2624640" d="1770">emotion.</p>
<p t="2626410" d="6530">And then maybe you&#39;re a kid and you stand
up underneath a table and you whack your head</p>
<p t="2632940" d="1300">on it when you&#39;re learning to walk.</p>
<p t="2634240" d="4330">And then when you go under the table now you
get anxious because you&#39;ve learned that if</p>
<p t="2638570" d="3360">you stand up under the table, you bang your
head and that hurts.</p>
<p t="2641930" d="2600">So anxiety under those circumstances is a
learned behaviour.</p>
<p t="2644530" d="1950">It&#39;s a conditioned response.</p>
<p t="2646480" d="1000">Got it?</p>
<p t="2647480" d="5720">Okay, but it&#39;s more complicated than that
because anxiety can also be an unlearned response.</p>
<p t="2653200" d="5680">So if you just encounter something you&#39;ve
never seen before, it&#39;s going to make you</p>
<p t="2658880" d="1000">anxious.</p>
<p t="2659880" d="2920">There&#39;s actually a circuit that mediates anxiety.</p>
<p t="2662800" d="3430">It&#39;s not just a secondary derivation of the
pain circuitry.</p>
<p t="2666230" d="2010">It&#39;s its own little unit.</p>
<p t="2668240" d="6180">And it&#39;s sort of like you&#39;ve figured out over
time--evolutionary time--not to get hurt because</p>
<p t="2674420" d="1340">you don&#39;t want to be damaged.</p>
<p t="2675760" d="5730">But then, you&#39;ve learned how to detect the
probability that you will get hurt for so</p>
<p t="2681490" d="4760">long that you&#39;ve also evolved a system just
to respond to that.</p>
<p t="2686250" d="4520">And so some of that responds to things that
you have learned are dangerous.</p>
<p t="2690770" d="4130">Some of it responds to things that are generally
just dangerous.</p>
<p t="2694900" d="9199">Blood, spiders, insects of various sorts,
facial expressions that indicate fear or disgust</p>
<p t="2704099" d="8111">or anger, broken limbs, bodies--especially
mutilated ones.</p>
<p t="2712210" d="4580">You know what&#39;s in horror movies, that&#39;s all
sort of primary fear stimuli, right.</p>
<p t="2716790" d="1059">And it&#39;s built right into you.</p>
<p t="2717849" d="5010">Now psychologists debate about whether it&#39;s
built in or whether you can just learn it</p>
<p t="2722859" d="1220">really easily.</p>
<p t="2724079" d="1750">But I would say that there&#39;s sort of a continuum.</p>
<p t="2725829" d="1540">Some of it seems pretty damn built-in.</p>
<p t="2727369" d="3161">Snake-fear, for example.</p>
<p t="2730530" d="3010">Chimps who&#39;ve never seen snakes, you bring
one into their cage--if it&#39;s a rubber snake--poof,</p>
<p t="2733540" d="1789">they hit the roof.</p>
<p t="2735329" d="1241">And then they look at it.</p>
<p t="2736570" d="4490">And snakes in the wild, a chimp will go up
to a big snake in the wild and hoot at it.</p>
<p t="2741060" d="3120">They have a special snake--they call it a
snake [rah?]--and they&#39;ll look at the thing,</p>
<p t="2744180" d="4020">and some of them will just look at the snake
for like 24 hours.</p>
<p t="2748200" d="3520">So, partly they&#39;re afraid of it.</p>
<p t="2751720" d="1040">Partly they want to explore it.</p>
<p t="2752760" d="4910">So what they do, they get close to it and
the fear increases, and then they back up</p>
<p t="2757670" d="1980">and the fear decreases and the curiosity increases.</p>
<p t="2759650" d="3790">And so what happens is that they move back
and forth until they&#39;re right on the line</p>
<p t="2763440" d="2540">where they&#39;re afraid, but they&#39;re curious.</p>
<p t="2765980" d="2599">So then they&#39;re stuck, and they&#39;re looking
at it.</p>
<p t="2768579" d="4921">And you experience that all the time actually,
because when you are engaged in something</p>
<p t="2773500" d="3420">that&#39;s meaningful, that&#39;s where you are.</p>
<p t="2776920" d="2550">And that&#39;s like the line between order and
chaos.</p>
<p t="2779470" d="2190">You know, because you want to solve it--it&#39;s
important.</p>
<p t="2781660" d="5020">Maybe you&#39;re reading papers about some illness
that you hope to work on or study.</p>
<p t="2786680" d="2860">It&#39;s like, well you&#39;re worried about the damn
illness, you know.</p>
<p t="2789540" d="3650">All you&#39;re doing is confronting it through
the papers so, you know, you&#39;re fairly well</p>
<p t="2793190" d="1250">sheltered from it.</p>
<p t="2794440" d="4169">But you don&#39;t want it to exist and you&#39;d rather
it wasn&#39;t around, but you&#39;re curious so you&#39;re</p>
<p t="2798609" d="1271">going to get engrossed in it.</p>
<p t="2799880" d="4719">And most of you, to the degree that you&#39;re
immersed in anything, are partly immersed</p>
<p t="2804599" d="2891">because you perceive it as a problem.</p>
<p t="2807490" d="3609">So that&#39;s like existential anxiety in a sense.</p>
<p t="2811099" d="2281">It&#39;s just part of being.</p>
<p t="2813380" d="2040">There&#39;s problems that have to be solved.</p>
<p t="2815420" d="3030">They produce anxiety, they&#39;re complicated.</p>
<p t="2818450" d="4300">You find this--you find a way of approaching
them so that the anxiety doesn&#39;t overwhelm</p>
<p t="2822750" d="4510">you and so the curiosity is optimized--that&#39;s
an incentive reward activation--and then you&#39;re</p>
<p t="2827260" d="1000">awake.</p>
<p t="2828260" d="3130">Because the anxiety keeps you awake and so
does the curiosity.</p>
<p t="2831390" d="2000">And you think, yeah, this is a good place
to be.</p>
<p t="2833390" d="3830">And it is a good place to be because you&#39;re
optimally protected right there and you&#39;re</p>
<p t="2837220" d="1359">optimally learning.</p>
<p t="2838579" d="2961">So yes, that&#39;s a good place to be.</p>
<p t="2841540" d="6579">You can think about that as an answer to the
Nietzschean problem of how you create value.</p>
<p t="2848119" d="3411">You don&#39;t exactly create it--you find it.</p>
<p t="2851530" d="5220">There&#39;s problems that need to be solved, they
automatically engage your emotions--both positively</p>
<p t="2856750" d="3369">and negatively--you&#39;ve got to find the right
balance.</p>
<p t="2860119" d="2341">And it&#39;s something like contending, you know.</p>
<p t="2862460" d="4010">It seems to me like humans beings have to
have something to contend with, or they can&#39;t</p>
<p t="2866470" d="1310">tolerate themselves.</p>
<p t="2867780" d="4710">Because life seems like a stupid joke if you
don&#39;t have something worthwhile to do.</p>
<p t="2872490" d="1650">But you can have something worthwhile to do.</p>
<p t="2874140" d="4350">And so then maybe it&#39;s not so stupid and absurd
and tragic.</p>
<p t="2878490" d="3180">And that&#39;s at least a good way to think about
it.</p>
<p t="2881670" d="3750">(00:48:00)
So you&#39;ve got satiation on the one hand, on</p>
<p t="2885420" d="4250">the positive side, and the behaviourists would&#39;ve
considered that an unconditioned response</p>
<p t="2889670" d="1000">too.</p>
<p t="2890670" d="1790">They really thought about that as a reward
initially.</p>
<p t="2892460" d="4159">You know, so you take a rat--he&#39;s hungry--and
you feed him something: reward.</p>
<p t="2896619" d="7710">Now Skinner, he used to train rats, right,
and he was a very--what would you call it--very</p>
<p t="2904329" d="2781">well renowned behavioural psychologists.</p>
<p t="2907110" d="2880">And he could train rats to do damn near anything.</p>
<p t="2909990" d="7200">And what he would do is starve them to three
quarters of their body weight--they were basically</p>
<p t="2917190" d="1000">hungry rats.</p>
<p t="2918190" d="4960">They were hungry lonesome rats because they
lived an isolated existence, which rats don&#39;t</p>
<p t="2923150" d="4940">like, and then they were starved down to three
quarters of their body weight.</p>
<p t="2928090" d="4550">When the behaviourists used rats as a model
for people, they actually used hungry lonesome</p>
<p t="2932640" d="4120">rats as a model for rats as a model for people.</p>
<p t="2936760" d="1980">And you might think, well what kind of model
is that?</p>
<p t="2938740" d="3950">But it turns out it&#39;s a pretty good model,
because you&#39;re a lot more like a scared hungry</p>
<p t="2942690" d="2660">rat than you&#39;d like to admit.</p>
<p t="2945350" d="3040">Which is partly why you can empathize with
one, right.</p>
<p t="2948390" d="3010">Everybody&#39;s sitting there thinking &quot;oh the
poor rats&quot;.</p>
<p t="2951400" d="2560">By the way, the more you thought that, the
more agreeable you are.</p>
<p t="2953960" d="3160">So how many people were feeling pretty sorry
for those rats?</p>
<p t="2957120" d="1000">Yeah.</p>
<p t="2958120" d="1300">How about men?</p>
<p t="2959420" d="3649">How many men were feeling sorry for those
rats?</p>
<p t="2963069" d="2030">Oh yeah, about three.</p>
<p t="2965099" d="6071">There&#39;s a big gender difference in agreeableness
between men and women, by the way.</p>
<p t="2971170" d="3409">Just so you know--we&#39;ll talk about that more.</p>
<p t="2974579" d="5162">So now the behaviourists also thought that
you have this primary set of rewards, call</p>
<p t="2979741" d="5618">them unconditioned, and then you had to learn
that some things predicted them.</p>
<p t="2985359" d="7391">Like, classically maybe, a rat would push
a lever and get a pellet.</p>
<p t="2992750" d="1480">Soon he&#39;s pushing that lever like mad.</p>
<p t="2994230" d="2210">He&#39;s pretty happy about pushing that lever.</p>
<p t="2996440" d="5320">And he learned the conditioned association
between lever pushing and getting a reward.</p>
<p t="3001760" d="4349">But it turns out that because that&#39;s been
around for so long, you also have a system</p>
<p t="3006109" d="1000">for it.</p>
<p t="3007109" d="4201">So it&#39;s not just a learned association to
what satiates you--it&#39;s a whole system.</p>
<p t="3011310" d="2700">And that&#39;s the dopaminergic system.</p>
<p t="3014010" d="3750">The serotonin system seems to be the thing
that satiates.</p>
<p t="3017760" d="4500">So you know, if you have a big turkey dinner,
up goes the serotonin levels--you don&#39;t have</p>
<p t="3022260" d="1000">to do anything.</p>
<p t="3023260" d="5250">And serotonin is a calming and regulating
neurochemical.</p>
<p t="3028510" d="5220">Which is why antidepressants stop your neurons
from taking up serotonin before you&#39;ve had</p>
<p t="3033730" d="4849">a real chance to use it to regulate your nervous
system.</p>
<p t="3038579" d="4091">But dopamine tells you, hey, good things are
on their way.</p>
<p t="3042670" d="2150">And that&#39;s pretty much what people run on.</p>
<p t="3044820" d="2070">And you can think about that as hope.</p>
<p t="3046890" d="3010">So incentive reward is sort of like hope,
or promise.</p>
<p t="3049900" d="2260">I think promise is a better term.</p>
<p t="3052160" d="5810">So there&#39;s pain and satiation, and those are
really ancient systems.</p>
<p t="3057970" d="7680">And then there are newer systems that are
anxiety and promise.</p>
<p t="3065650" d="4840">And those are related to those more fundamental
negative and positive emotions.</p>
<p t="3070490" d="3090">And those things regulate you while you&#39;re
on your path.</p>
<p t="3073580" d="5019">Now, there&#39;s one more level of complication,
because you think, well what can happen on</p>
<p t="3078599" d="1421">the way to your goal.</p>
<p t="3080020" d="1000">Nothing?</p>
<p t="3081020" d="1000">Irrelevant.</p>
<p t="3082020" d="6059">Okay, so that&#39;s the irrelevance that enables
you to not see the gorilla.</p>
<p t="3088079" d="3101">And almost everything around you is irrelevant.</p>
<p t="3091180" d="2919">And I think that&#39;s partly why I think people
don&#39;t like to have their little maps of the</p>
<p t="3094099" d="1961">world destroyed.</p>
<p t="3096060" d="5090">Because if your map of the world is thoroughly
demolished everything becomes relevant.</p>
<p t="3101150" d="3080">And you do not want everything to become relevant.</p>
<p t="3104230" d="2060">It&#39;s just too much for you.</p>
<p t="3106290" d="4250">So you wake up and you&#39;re naked and it&#39;s dark
in the middle of a jungle.</p>
<p t="3110540" d="1440">It&#39;s like, everything&#39;s relevant!</p>
<p t="3111980" d="2220">You&#39;re not going to like that.</p>
<p t="3114200" d="1520">It&#39;s going to burn you out quick.</p>
<p t="3115720" d="5570">And so most of the time you have to be protected
so that almost everything&#39;s irrelevant.</p>
<p t="3121290" d="5690">And then you can focus on the few things that
you&#39;re capable of handling, and you do that.</p>
<p t="3126980" d="4650">So you&#39;re in your little map, and then as
you move towards it your emotions play.</p>
<p t="3131630" d="3670">And the negative emotions appear when things
are not going well and the positive emotions</p>
<p t="3135300" d="1980">appear when things are going well.</p>
<p t="3137280" d="2819">That&#39;s basically how your emotions work.</p>
<p t="3140099" d="4891">Now, you&#39;ve got your satiation and your pain.</p>
<p t="3144990" d="3290">Then you&#39;ve got your threat and your promise.</p>
<p t="3148280" d="3700">Then on top of that you&#39;ve got a more complicated
thing which is novelty, because that&#39;s the</p>
<p t="3151980" d="5270">other thing that can happen when you&#39;re on
the way from point A to point B. Something</p>
<p t="3157250" d="4940">you didn&#39;t expect--and you don&#39;t understand.</p>
<p t="3162190" d="12500">So </p>
<p t="3174690" d="7350">you&#39;re walking down the street and there&#39;s
someone laying there face-down on the sidewalk.</p>
<p t="3182040" d="6549">And you know, they&#39;re dishevelled, and so
well, what&#39;s your emotional response?</p>
<p t="3188589" d="4791">Well you didn&#39;t expect it, so you&#39;re going
to be taken aback a bit: that&#39;s anxiety.</p>
<p t="3193380" d="4229">It&#39;s like, you&#39;re moving towards your goal
and anxiety stops you.</p>
<p t="3197609" d="7891">Now you can think of the space-time area around
that person as unexplored territory.</p>
<p t="3205500" d="3410">Now you don&#39;t want any unexplored territory
in your map because god only knows what&#39;s</p>
<p t="3208910" d="2080">going to happen there.</p>
<p t="3210990" d="2200">So what&#39;re you supposed to do?</p>
<p t="3213190" d="3180">Well maybe you cross the street--you think
well that person&#39;s drunk or maybe you think,</p>
<p t="3216370" d="1790">well they&#39;re a homeless person.</p>
<p t="3218160" d="2850">Maybe they&#39;re lying on a sleeping back--you
think they&#39;re just asleep.</p>
<p t="3221010" d="5050">You&#39;re going to stop and then you&#39;re going
to observe, and then you&#39;re going to use little</p>
<p t="3226060" d="1910">cues to try to put your map back together.</p>
<p t="3227970" d="3450">And your map is, what's going on here and
what should I do about it?</p>
<p t="3231420" d="3510">And so, it&#39;s partly this interplay between
anxiety and curiosity.</p>
<p t="3234930" d="4610">Now you can just step around it and continue,
but maybe that&#39;ll upset your moral map--what</p>
<p t="3239540" d="1260">kind of person am I?</p>
<p t="3240800" d="1921">Maybe I should have done something about it.</p>
<p t="3242721" d="4839">Or maybe you think, there&#39;s no damn way I&#39;m
going to get involved in this because, who</p>
<p t="3247560" d="2140">knows what&#39;ll happen if I step in there.</p>
<p t="3249700" d="5020">And you know, fair enough, because, who knows
what&#39;ll happen if you step in there.</p>
<p t="3254720" d="6359">The point is that, it&#39;s like your map which
has made everything irrelevant has got a hole</p>
<p t="3261079" d="4061">in it and now some of what&#39;s complicated is
shining through.</p>
<p t="3265140" d="3740">And that thing that&#39;s shining through--so
that&#39;s like what the phenomenologists talked</p>
<p t="3268880" d="4479">about as shining forth--that thing that&#39;s
shining through, it&#39;s like you don&#39;t know</p>
<p t="3273359" d="1391">what to do about it.</p>
<p t="3274750" d="1369">What should you do?</p>
<p t="3276119" d="6351">Well, you should do what you do do, and what
you do is, you prepare to do everything.</p>
<p t="3282470" d="2670">And that&#39;s an emotional response to novelty.</p>
<p t="3285140" d="4969">Well, if you don&#39;t know what to do you should
prepare yourself for anything.</p>
<p t="3290109" d="2720">And that&#39;s stress.</p>
<p t="3292829" d="2401">You could prepare that something good will
happen.</p>
<p t="3295230" d="2650">Let's say you&#39;re in an ambivalent.</p>
