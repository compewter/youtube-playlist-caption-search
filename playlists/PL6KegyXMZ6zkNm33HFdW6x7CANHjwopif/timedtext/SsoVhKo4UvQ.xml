<p t="1740" d="4260">This lecture, and the next, are probably the
most explicitly philosophical lectures of</p>
<p t="6000" d="1100">the course.</p>
<p t="7100" d="6199">Then, we move into psychometrics, and biological
psychology.</p>
<p t="13299" d="4021">Those are going to be the most scientific
lectures of the course.</p>
<p t="17320" d="8129">I was thinking, this morning, while I was
preparing this lecture, about why I approach</p>
<p t="25449" d="5011">these topics this way.</p>
<p t="30460" d="7900">Part of the answer is, probably, that it is
not clear that the study of personality - at</p>
<p t="38360" d="8550">least, insofar as the concern is to further
the development of personality, which is a</p>
<p t="46910" d="4260">term associated with the desire for mental
health, or &quot;subjective well-being,&quot; a term</p>
<p t="51170" d="7310">I really do not like, or &quot;meaning&quot; - can be
strictly scientific pursuits.</p>
<p t="58480" d="7679">So, then, if they&#39;re not strictly scientific
pursuits, what should you do about understanding</p>
<p t="66159" d="4981">them?</p>
<p t="71140" d="5930">If you look at studies, after studies, the
problem is you get a very narrow slice of</p>
<p t="77070" d="1000">the domain.</p>
<p t="78070" d="5289">It&#39;s often not very comprehensible because,
in order to understand the results of a study,</p>
<p t="83359" d="3981">you have to have the knowledge - the underlying
knowledge - that is necessary to put the study</p>
<p t="87340" d="3480">in some sort of framework.</p>
<p t="90820" d="5610">That framework is going to be developed by
studying the relevant scientific literature</p>
<p t="96430" d="1689">and psychological literature.</p>
<p t="98119" d="7381">Behind that, the framework has to be expanded
to include the relevant philosophical assumptions.</p>
<p t="105500" d="5490">I do not really think that you can understand
the details without understanding the assumptions.</p>
<p t="110990" d="7089">I also think you are relegated to memorization
if you do not understand the fundamentals.</p>
<p t="118079" d="3350">Memorization has very little to do with knowledge.</p>
<p t="121429" d="4601">You might be able to memorize procedures that
would enable you to act on something, perhaps</p>
<p t="126030" d="3660">to fix an automobile or to play a piece on
the piano.</p>
<p t="129690" d="2710">It is not like those things are not worth
doing.</p>
<p t="132400" d="8770">But for these ideas to take root and have
affect and meaning, you have to understand</p>
<p t="141170" d="1240">them at the right level of analysis.</p>
<p t="142410" d="3940">One of the things I really like about personality
theory, especially the clinical end of it,</p>
<p t="146350" d="5350">though not exclusively the clinical end of
it, is that the people who were conducting</p>
<p t="151700" d="5520">clinical practice and writing clinical theory
during the 20th century were in fact dealing</p>
<p t="157220" d="4090">with the most profound problems that affect
people.</p>
<p t="161310" d="4920">I started my academic career as a political
scientist, while in so far as you&#39;re any sort</p>
<p t="166230" d="3610">of political scientist when you are an undergraduate.</p>
<p t="169840" d="4500">I was not interested in it at all by my third
year because what I found was that, at least</p>
<p t="174340" d="5350">at this time - and I don&#39;t know how much it
has changed - the political scientists had</p>
<p t="179690" d="5010">already decided that people were basically
motivated by economic concerns.</p>
<p t="184700" d="5540">To me that was no use at all because I wanted
to know why they were motivated by economic</p>
<p t="190240" d="1340">concerns.</p>
<p t="191580" d="6240">It is easy to understand people in some sense
if you already decide what they value.</p>
<p t="197820" d="4100">But if you can&#39;t figure out what they value,
or what they should value, that is a whole</p>
<p t="201920" d="4420">different issue - and that&#39;s psychology.</p>
<p t="206340" d="4130">It is a deep question because it isn&#39;t even
obvious whether the question &quot;are there things</p>
<p t="210470" d="6040">you should value&quot; is a reasonable question
or that it can be reasonably answered.</p>
<p t="216510" d="4920">The thing I can tell you about that is most
closely allied with my own experience.</p>
<p t="221430" d="6650">I do not mean personal experience, but say,
experience as a clinician, is that aimless</p>
<p t="228080" d="2990">people are in real trouble.</p>
<p t="231070" d="2360">Now I do not necessarily know why that is.</p>
<p t="233430" d="6450">And I do not necessarily know what that means
for what your aim should be, but I have certainly</p>
<p t="239880" d="1000">seen,</p>
<p t="240880" d="3340">for example, if you had to make a choice which
all of you will in the next five years or</p>
<p t="244220" d="8280">so between pursuing something diligently and
establishing a fixed identity because of that,</p>
<p t="252500" d="4690">or remaining bereft of choice and drifting.</p>
<p t="257190" d="3999">I can tell you that if you drift, by the time
you are 30, you are going to be one miserable</p>
<p t="261189" d="1091">person.</p>
<p t="262280" d="4550">Now I am not sure why that is exactly, and
I am not exactly sure that that necessarily</p>
<p t="266830" d="4260">means that picking something and sticking
to it, which is a form of apprenticeship,</p>
<p t="271090" d="2180">is better than drifting.</p>
<p t="273270" d="2829">It depends what you mean by better.</p>
<p t="276099" d="5160">But I can tell you that not catalyzing an
identity seems to be a mistake, and it is</p>
<p t="281259" d="1701">a fatal mistake by the time you are 40.</p>
<p t="282960" d="3810">It is very difficult to recover from it at
that point.</p>
<p t="286770" d="2859">because you are not young anymore, at that
point.</p>
<p t="289629" d="4211">If you try to catalyze an identity at that
time, which sometimes can happen, you are</p>
<p t="293840" d="6180">competing with all these young shiny people,
who are fuller of potential from the perspective</p>
<p t="300020" d="2580">of an employer, for example, then you are.</p>
<p t="302600" d="3909">It gets pretty dismal.</p>
<p t="306509" d="6921">Anyways, today we&#39;re going to go deeper into
philosophical presuppositions than we have</p>
<p t="313430" d="3600">in the past.</p>
<p t="317030" d="4830">I want to familiarize you with what I think
are the great philosophical and psychological</p>
<p t="321860" d="3910">movements of the 20th century because they
shape you and they shape the world you live</p>
<p t="325770" d="5489">in, in ways that are incalculable.</p>
<p t="331259" d="3011">If you do not understand them, you do not
really know where you are.</p>
<p t="334270" d="4320">You do not know where you are in history and
you do not know what ideas you are possessed</p>
<p t="338590" d="1000">by.</p>
<p t="339590" d="5630">I think I told you when we were studying Jung,
that Jung said that - people do not have ideas,</p>
<p t="345220" d="4550">that ideas have people - which I believe to
be true.</p>
<p t="349770" d="6090">One of Jung&#39;s lasting contributions in some
sense, was that you should know what ideas</p>
<p t="355860" d="6119">possess you because otherwise you will not
know what the hell they are doing with you.</p>
<p t="361979" d="4231">When you think about all the irrational and
apparently counterproductive things that people</p>
<p t="366210" d="6959">do as individuals and also in a mass, you
have to ask yourself if you want to be caught</p>
<p t="373169" d="1370">up in that sort of thing.</p>
<p t="374539" d="6361">If you could be free from it, if you are caught
up in it, just exactly where is it that you</p>
<p t="380900" d="1000">are headed.</p>
<p t="381900" d="3989">Which was also something that Jung thought
you should figure out in case where you are</p>
<p t="385889" d="6810">headed was not necessarily where you would
go if you were making a fully informed conscious</p>
<p t="392699" d="1000">choice.</p>
<p t="393699" d="5000">I think that material that we&#39;re dealing within
the next two lectures, is the most relevant</p>
<p t="398699" d="8680">of all the material were going to cover with
regards to the possession of people by ideas.</p>
<p t="407379" d="6780">The existentialists, who are tightly aligned
philosophically with the phenomenologists,</p>
<p t="414159" d="8820">basically emerged as a psychological movement
after World War II.There are reasons for this.</p>
<p t="422979" d="5021">One of the reasons was that it was quite obvious,
not only that World War II was an ideological</p>
<p t="428000" d="7259">battle fundamentally between Fascism and Western
democracy roughly speaking,</p>
<p t="435259" d="4830">and it was immediately supplanted by another
ideological battle, which was the one between</p>
<p t="440089" d="3140">communism and liberalism, roughly speaking.</p>
<p t="443229" d="7571">The issue of ideological possession and the
relationship between the individual, who is</p>
<p t="450800" d="5780">ideologically possessed, and their responsibility
and the actions of the state, became paramount</p>
<p t="456580" d="3410">concerns in the 1950s, as they should have.</p>
<p t="459990" d="6009">One of the lasting questions that remained
after World War II that still has been insufficiently</p>
<p t="465999" d="1961">answered is,</p>
<p t="467960" d="8810">when the mass goes insane, what is the culpability
of the individuals who compose the mass?</p>
<p t="476770" d="4850">Now you can circumvent that question with
regards to what happened in Nazi Germany by</p>
<p t="481620" d="6680">assuming that it was top-down coercion that
turned the mass of ordinary German citizens</p>
<p t="488300" d="3489">into majority Nazis.</p>
<p t="491789" d="3580">I do not think that there is any evidence
that those sorts of ideas are true.</p>
<p t="495369" d="6461">There is research bearing on people&#39;s willingness
to conform to authority figures.</p>
<p t="501830" d="5800">You know the famous experiments on the prison
experiment.</p>
<p t="507630" d="5820">For example, at Stanford, where undergraduates
were divided arbitrarily into guards and prisoners,</p>
<p t="513450" d="5490">and then they ran a simulation of the prison,
and of course the guards turned into sadistic</p>
<p t="518940" d="1800">psychopaths,</p>
<p t="520740" d="1109">some of them did anyways.</p>
<p t="521849" d="3811">The prisoners turned into cringing victims
in no time flat.</p>
<p t="525660" d="6520">There is obviously an element there that demonstrates
that people are very responsive to situational</p>
<p t="532180" d="4700">cues and that they can go out of hand very
rapidly.</p>
<p t="536880" d="8709">But that does not necessarily mean that you
can use your tendency to be accommodating</p>
<p t="545589" d="5301">to authority or the human tendency to be accommodating
to authority, as an explanation for the rise</p>
<p t="550890" d="7910">of mass movements like Nazism or communism,
because the explanation does not really help.</p>
<p t="558800" d="3240">Okay, some people in the mass were mere followers.</p>
<p t="562040" d="1620">What about the leaders?</p>
<p t="563660" d="4609">Well, maybe they were all followers&#39; right
up to Hitler, so it is Hitler&#39;s fault.</p>
<p t="568269" d="1211">It is all Hitler&#39;s fault?</p>
<p t="569480" d="3979">You are elevating the guy of the status of
a God at that point.</p>
<p t="573459" d="7001">Now an evil God, but still, if he has got
all the motive power, you cannot separate</p>
<p t="580460" d="1530">him from the idea of Lucifer.</p>
<p t="581990" d="3260">He has become an archetypical figure of evil
at that point.</p>
<p t="585250" d="2090">It&#39;s the same with Stalin and Mao.</p>
<p t="587340" d="3020">We know that they were very, very bad men.</p>
<p t="590360" d="2120">There is no doubt about it.</p>
<p t="592480" d="5850">But to localize all the evil in them and to
consider everyone else victimized followers,</p>
<p t="598330" d="7819">is a convenient idea, but it is not helpful.</p>
<p t="606149" d="4041">That just makes the followers pathetic for
a different reason.</p>
<p t="610190" d="6250">They&#39;re not actively self-engaged in cruelty
for their own purposes apart from conformity,</p>
<p t="616440" d="3690">but they are just as pathetic and evil as
they would be if they were doing it on their</p>
<p t="620130" d="1800">own volition.</p>
<p t="621930" d="2649">I do not see the difference between a bully
and a bully&#39;s henchmen.</p>
<p t="624579" d="3981">In fact, I think the bully probably has more
courage than the henchmen.</p>
<p t="628560" d="6920">It is courage of a fairly peculiar sort.</p>
<p t="635480" d="3130">This is what the existentialists were concerned
about.</p>
<p t="638610" d="12970">The locus of their concern was 
basically Nietzsche.</p>
<p t="651580" d="5840">You all know that the reason I concentrate
on Nietzsche and also on Dostoyevsky&#39;s because</p>
<p t="657420" d="3099">I think those two people summed up the 19th
century.</p>
<p t="660519" d="2891">I really think that.</p>
<p t="663410" d="8890">The problems that they laid out and predicted
would unfold in the 20th century, were the</p>
<p t="672300" d="2339">problems that unfolded in the 20th century.</p>
<p t="674639" d="5371">They got their predictions right and I think
they got their causality right too.</p>
<p t="680010" d="5620">Given the inability of social scientists,
including psychologists, to predict large</p>
<p t="685630" d="5860">term mass events, the fact that these two
people managed at 30 to 40 years before the</p>
<p t="691490" d="4769">events unfolded and even longer that not seems
to me that it is pretty much worthwhile to</p>
<p t="696259" d="2961">consider them psychologists.</p>
<p t="699220" d="1489">Certainly Nietzsche thought that of himself.</p>
<p t="700709" d="3570">And so did Dostoyevsky for that matter, and
they had immense influence on people like</p>
<p t="704279" d="4990">Freud and Jung and Rogers, all the people
that we have been studying.</p>
<p t="709269" d="6221">Their thinking is lying underneath every issue
we have discussed.</p>
<p t="715490" d="6000">This is one of Nietzsche&#39;s great statements.</p>
<p t="721490" d="3889">Of what is great one must either be silent
or speak with greatness.</p>
<p t="725379" d="2940">With greatness, that means cynically and with
innocence.</p>
<p t="728319" d="5460">What I relate is the history of the next two
centuries.</p>
<p t="733779" d="5730">I describe what is coming, what can no longer
come differently, the advent of nihilism.</p>
<p t="739509" d="3640">Our whole European culture is moving from
some time now, with a tortured tension that</p>
<p t="743149" d="6730">is growing from decade to decade, as toward
a catastrophe restlessly, violently, headlong,</p>
<p t="749879" d="3471">like a river that wants to reach the end,
that no longer reflects.</p>
<p t="753350" d="2440">It&#39;s afraid to reflect.</p>
<p t="755790" d="5349">He that speaks here has, conversely, done
nothing so far but to reflect as a philosopher</p>
<p t="761139" d="7101">and solitary by instinct, who was found his
advantage in standing aside, outside.</p>
<p t="768240" d="5310">Why has the advent of nihilism become necessary?</p>
<p t="773550" d="5020">Because the values we have had hitherto thus
draw their final consequence.</p>
<p t="778570" d="5959">Because nihilism represents the ultimate logical
extension of our great values and ideals.</p>
<p t="784529" d="4391">Because we must experience nihilism before
we can find out what value these values really</p>
<p t="788920" d="2039">had.</p>
<p t="790959" d="6961">So one of Nietzsche&#39;s claims, for example,
was that as Christianity in Europe transformed</p>
<p t="797920" d="9240">itself into science, he felt that one of the
advantage to the Catholic domination of Europe</p>
<p t="807160" d="6900">for so many centuries, was that the mind of
the Catholic adherents who took the discipline</p>
<p t="814060" d="7209">seriously, or the dogma seriously, learned
to interpret all events under the under the</p>
<p t="821269" d="2531">schema of a single theory.</p>
<p t="823800" d="2390">He thought about that as a form of discipline.</p>
<p t="826190" d="6589">Imagine that if I want to teach you how to
theorize, I might teach you a theory and have</p>
<p t="832779" d="3160">you adopt it.</p>
<p t="835939" d="3851">Nietzsche&#39;s point would be that while you
know a theory, but it also means something</p>
<p t="839790" d="1000">else.</p>
<p t="840790" d="5950">It also means that now you know how to theorize
and the important consequence of learning</p>
<p t="846740" d="1399">a theory may not be the theory.</p>
<p t="848139" d="3421">It may be that you learn to theorize.</p>
<p t="851560" d="3709">Nietzsche also pointed out that once you learn
to theorize, you can separate yourself from</p>
<p t="855269" d="3091">the theory that gave rise to that knowledge.</p>
<p t="858360" d="4380">And so you can start to theorize even about
the theory that you mastered, and he thought</p>
<p t="862740" d="4589">that is what happened to Europe as a consequence
of its domination by Christianity, especially</p>
<p t="867329" d="4940">because of Christianity&#39;s essential insistence
on the utility of the truth.</p>
<p t="872269" d="6760">He thought that was transformed after Catholicism,
into scientific investigation, but that the</p>
<p t="879029" d="2910">Spirit of theorizing in truth, remained intact.</p>
<p t="881939" d="4760">The consequence of that was that the European
mind was disciplined by a dogma.</p>
<p t="886699" d="4880">That it freed itself from the dogma, that
it turned its power on the dogma, and noted</p>
<p t="891579" d="5851">that the dogma itself, seemed to be grounded
in nothing that you could get a grip on.</p>
<p t="897430" d="3060">The way you grip things with an empirical
mind.</p>
<p t="900490" d="2810">And so it fell apart.</p>
<p t="903300" d="6310">That&#39;s not saying much more than science posed
a fatal challenge to religion, but it&#39;s saying</p>
<p t="909610" d="3130">it in a much more profound and interesting
way.</p>
<p t="912740" d="4730">It also explains why he makes this claim,
that nihilism is the logical conclusion of</p>
<p t="917470" d="1340">the great values and ideals.</p>
<p t="918810" d="5670">He did not think about nihilism as a counter
proposition, say to dogmatic Christianity.</p>
<p t="924480" d="6169">He thought about it as the logical outcome
of that.</p>
<p t="930649" d="1161">Is that relevant?</p>
<p t="931810" d="1500">Why is that relevant?</p>
<p t="933310" d="4480">Well think it&#39;s relevant for a lot of reasons.</p>
<p t="937790" d="6359">The first observation might be that a tremendous
amount of mental illness, this is an existential</p>
<p t="944149" d="3050">claim, is grounded in nihilism.</p>
<p t="947199" d="4750">When someone who is depressed, comes to see
you, what they often say is, I cannot see</p>
<p t="951949" d="2651">any point in life.</p>
<p t="954600" d="2159">That isn&#39;t what they mean.</p>
<p t="956759" d="6260">What they mean is, they see the meaning of
life as suffering, which is a meaning, right?</p>
<p t="963019" d="1980">And that is not bearable.</p>
<p t="964999" d="4641">And then the question is, why bother with
it?</p>
<p t="969640" d="2119">And that is the fundamental question of suicide.</p>
<p t="971759" d="1880">It is a philosophical question.</p>
<p t="973639" d="4363">I think it was Camus who said, the only real
philosophical question was whether or not</p>
<p t="978002" d="1688">to commit suicide.</p>
<p t="979690" d="4870">Now you know, that is a little dark, coming
like well maybe Camus could use some SSRI&#39;s,</p>
<p t="984560" d="2410">but you get the point.</p>
<p t="986970" d="9539">And it is inappropriate, in my estimation,
to even discuss depression with someone who</p>
<p t="996509" d="5961">is depressed, especially if they are intelligent
and open, and therefore more tilted towards</p>
<p t="1002470" d="4180">philosophical wanderings without actually
addressing the issue.</p>
<p t="1006650" d="1820">Why live in the face of suffering?</p>
<p t="1008470" d="6320">Okay, so that is one problem.To the degree
that you will find it difficult in your life</p>
<p t="1014790" d="6669">to build anything solid under your feet that
you can stand on and believe, have faith in,</p>
<p t="1021459" d="2500">let&#39;s say, you are going to be adrift.</p>
<p t="1023959" d="4120">The reason for that is a lot of the things
are going to have to do will be difficult</p>
<p t="1028079" d="3880">and they will involve suffering, which is
also an existential claim.</p>
<p t="1031959" d="3990">So, the existentialist for example, they do
not make the same claim Freud does.</p>
<p t="1035949" d="7321">Freud claims that, in some sense that the
normal person is mentally healthy apart from</p>
<p t="1043270" d="5440">the mild distress of normal life, and in order
to be psychopathological, you have to have</p>
<p t="1048710" d="2610">been hurt,</p>
<p t="1051320" d="4340">maybe multiple times or, there are other things
that could contribute to that the existentialist</p>
<p t="1055660" d="3880">would say no, no, let us just wait a minute
here.</p>
<p t="1059540" d="6619">Maybe the fundamental condition of human beings
is nihilism and suffering, and that something</p>
<p t="1066159" d="5961">has to be produced to counter that in order
for life to be tolerable.</p>
<p t="1072120" d="3820">Well, I think that is a perfectly reasonable
proposition.</p>
<p t="1075940" d="5950">It&#39;s a strange proposition because I have
seen in my lifetime, people who are tormented</p>
<p t="1081890" d="3060">by existential ideas who cannot get them out
of their mind.</p>
<p t="1084950" d="4780">You know, ideas that relate to the meaning
of life, other people and concern about death,</p>
<p t="1089730" d="3780">for example, and the extinguishing of everything
that seems to have any value.</p>
<p t="1093510" d="2149">It is a primary concern with them.</p>
<p t="1095659" d="3241">I have seen other people for whom those questions
never seem to arise.</p>
<p t="1098900" d="7110">Now, I think those people are conservative
people, not very open and probably rather</p>
<p t="1106010" d="1200">low with neuroticism.</p>
<p t="1107210" d="2050">They are not philosophically curious.</p>
<p t="1109260" d="3150">They do not go up chains of abstractions.</p>
<p t="1112410" d="4880">Even if they do, they do not necessarily get
disturbed in the most profound areas of their</p>
<p t="1117290" d="2239">being by the questioning.</p>
<p t="1119529" d="11551">That still leaves plenty of people in the
other category.</p>
<p t="1131080" d="1790">Nihilism and atheism are closely related.</p>
<p t="1132870" d="3189">They are not identical by any stretch of the
imagination.</p>
<p t="1136059" d="6271">Although I think it is difficult for atheism
to describe why it is not essentially nihilistic.</p>
<p t="1142330" d="3020">That is Dostoyevsky&#39;s big criticism.</p>
<p t="1145350" d="6870">Dostoyevsky&#39;s claim was that without any fundamental
value assumed, then there is no reason why</p>
<p t="1152220" d="2960">you cannot do anything you want.</p>
<p t="1155180" d="1239">And that is his famous line.</p>
<p t="1156419" d="2321">&quot;If there is no God, then everything is permitted&quot;.</p>
<p t="1158740" d="7130">All of Dostoyevsky&#39;s novel writing is an exploration
of that idea.</p>
<p t="1165870" d="3510">Sometimes it is an exploration of what that
idea might mean if it was acted out in the</p>
<p t="1169380" d="3610">life of the given individual, Crime and Punishment.</p>
<p t="1172990" d="3860">Another would be, in his book, The Devils
or The Possessed.</p>
<p t="1176850" d="6500">It is an examination of what that idea means
if it is gripped by an individual who has</p>
<p t="1183350" d="1610">social and political ambitions.</p>
<p t="1184960" d="6150">That is when Dostoyevsky basically prophesied,
so to speak, that one of the consequences</p>
<p t="1191110" d="5130">of the death of God would be the rise, basically,
of Communist of totalitarianism because essentially,</p>
<p t="1196240" d="2860">that is what he predicted in The Devils.</p>
<p t="1199100" d="2500">It is pretty dead on accurate prediction.</p>
<p t="1201600" d="3079">It was really quite stunning to me when I
came across it.</p>
<p t="1204679" d="3591">Nietzsche made exactly the same prediction,
by the way.</p>
<p t="1208270" d="5279">For those two men, the death of an ultimate
meaning system, especially one that you see</p>
<p t="1213549" d="4000">when you think about something like European
Christianity at its misleading, in some sense,</p>
<p t="1217549" d="6701">because the system of beliefs that that constituted
European Christianity and other great belief</p>
<p t="1224250" d="2870">systems wasn&#39;t 2000 years old.</p>
<p t="1227120" d="3040">It was 25,000 years old.</p>
<p t="1230160" d="6570">You know you can think about it as beginning
at year zero but it is a mistake from a historical</p>
<p t="1236730" d="1000">perspective.</p>
<p t="1237730" d="6799">The ideas that profound religious traditions
are predicated on are generally grounded in</p>
<p t="1244529" d="4500">ideas that are much older than the traditions
themselves.</p>
<p t="1249029" d="5211">In some sense when at the end of the 19th
century when things fell apart for us and</p>
<p t="1254240" d="5620">we can no longer rely on our history predicated
morality to guide us.</p>
<p t="1259860" d="5090">It wasn&#39;t merely that we lost an overlay,
a psychological overlay that it be laid on</p>
<p t="1264950" d="1750">humanity for 2000 years.</p>
<p t="1266700" d="2570">It was way deeper than that.</p>
<p t="1269270" d="3159">We do not even know how old those how will
those ideas are.</p>
<p t="1272429" d="2191">We know we have some idea about how old they
are there.</p>
<p t="1274620" d="2910">They are at least as old as written culture.</p>
<p t="1277530" d="4840">But we also know that the people who have
been brought into the main streams of history,</p>
<p t="1282370" d="5799">you know, as the world has united people who
were not literate had mythologies that drew</p>
<p t="1288169" d="1341">from the same themes.</p>
<p t="1289510" d="5190">Some of those people, as far as we can tell,
had lived a lifestyle that was essentially</p>
<p t="1294700" d="2699">unchanged for 25,000 years.</p>
<p t="1297399" d="3650">Australian aborigines are like that.</p>
<p t="1301049" d="4051">There is plenty of evidence that these ideas
are extraordinarily old.</p>
<p t="1305100" d="3679">What that means is, when we separate from
them in some sense, not only do we separate</p>
<p t="1308779" d="6911">from our philosophical presuppositions, but
we separate from the historical consequences</p>
<p t="1315690" d="1000">of our biology.</p>
<p t="1316690" d="2349">It is a serious problem.</p>
<p t="1319039" d="5490">I think that is partly why it is very difficult
to distinguish between someone who is nihilistic</p>
<p t="1324529" d="2411">and someone who is mentally ill.</p>
<p t="1326940" d="3540">It is not a radical claim.</p>
<p t="1330480" d="4650">People, especially those on the depressed
side of the distribution, will tell you that</p>
<p t="1335130" d="1000">they are nihilistic.</p>
<p t="1336130" d="2740">They may not use that terminology, although
they often do.</p>
<p t="1338870" d="6419">I just cannot see any point, what why does
that matter or why does it matter.</p>
<p t="1345289" d="1851">It seems to be a fact that it matters.</p>
<p t="1347140" d="5350">It is an interesting fact, that is a phenomenological
fact in some sense, because one of the things</p>
<p t="1352490" d="7370">that Heidegger pointed out, he was a founder
of the phenomenological school, was that your</p>
<p t="1359860" d="4740">primary orientation to the world, he thinks
in a strange way, that your primary orientation</p>
<p t="1364600" d="3130">to the world was one of care.</p>
<p t="1367730" d="2990">You could say, what characterizes your experience?</p>
<p t="1370720" d="2140">What sort of creature are you?</p>
<p t="1372860" d="4911">Heidegger&#39;s answer would be, you are a creature
who cares about things, in so far as your</p>
<p t="1377771" d="4179">engaged in the world, your primary orientation
is one of care.</p>
<p t="1381950" d="1950">You can think about that as a value.</p>
<p t="1383900" d="2820">It is a consequence of your value orientation.</p>
<p t="1386720" d="2540">God only knows where that comes from.</p>
<p t="1389260" d="3430">Part of it is biological, part of it is developmental,
part of it is historical.</p>
<p t="1392690" d="2369">It is very, very complex.</p>
<p t="1395059" d="4350">But if you stop caring about everything, you
are in trouble.</p>
<p t="1399409" d="5311">That is one of the things that seems to indicate
that caring is actually a fundamental reality.</p>
<p t="1404720" d="3189">You stop caring about things, you do not stop
suffering.</p>
<p t="1407909" d="4990">It seems that unless the caring counterbalances
the suffering, you cannot maintain an even</p>
<p t="1412899" d="1000">keel.</p>
<p t="1413899" d="1241">That is partly because it does not seem just.</p>
<p t="1415140" d="5180">When terrible things happen to people, they
always say two things.</p>
<p t="1420320" d="3880">How it is that being could be constituted
in this manner?</p>
<p t="1424200" d="3890">What the hell&#39;s going on at the fundamental
levels of reality, that such suffering has</p>
<p t="1428090" d="1000">to be the case?</p>
<p t="1429090" d="5450">You will certainly ask that if you have a
child was diagnosed with cancer, for example.</p>
<p t="1434540" d="6100">Or you might think, why is this cruelty as
it appears necessarily aimed at me right now</p>
<p t="1440640" d="4250">in this place, when hypothetically it could
have not happened at all, or perhaps been</p>
<p t="1444890" d="3400">visited on someone more deserving.</p>
<p t="1448290" d="4450">Which is the good remain the good are punished
and the evil remain unpunished something like</p>
<p t="1452740" d="1850">that.</p>
<p t="1454590" d="8250">For human beings that produces a 
cry for justice.</p>
<p t="1462840" d="2120">How can the world be constituted that way?</p>
<p t="1464960" d="1449">That seems to be built into us.</p>
<p t="1466409" d="1860">Those aren&#39;t questions we can just avoid.</p>
<p t="1468269" d="2260">They&#39;re questions that will arise in your
psyche.</p>
<p t="1470529" d="6531">They will arise as fundamental questions when
sufficiently terrible things happen to you.</p>
<p t="1477060" d="3910">So the existentialists would say, those are
conditions of existence, you are just stuck</p>
<p t="1480970" d="1000">with that.</p>
<p t="1481970" d="1410">It&#39;s part of human nature.</p>
<p t="1483380" d="5510">It&#39;s part of human being to be perplexed by
those questions.</p>
<p t="1488890" d="4630">Then the question is, at least in part, is
there any way of answering them?</p>
<p t="1493520" d="7120">Nietzsche said, we required some time, new
values.</p>
<p t="1500640" d="2080">Nihilism stands at the door.</p>
<p t="1502720" d="4110">Whence comes this uncanniest of all guests?</p>
<p t="1506830" d="2579">Point of departure.</p>
<p t="1509409" d="3971">It is an error to consider social distress
or physiological degeneration or corruption</p>
<p t="1513380" d="2889">of all things as the cause of nihilism.</p>
<p t="1516269" d="6551">Now that is a typical Nietzschian phrase because
there are three profound ideas in that sentence.</p>
<p t="1522820" d="3190">Each one is in a different phrase.</p>
<p t="1526010" d="4320">Nietzsche said at one point, I can write in
a sentence what other people write in a book.</p>
<p t="1530330" d="4560">Then he said, what other people cannot even
write in a book.</p>
<p t="1534890" d="1430">This sentence is a good example of that.</p>
<p t="1536320" d="6160">So what is he say? if you see that people
are suffering and in trouble, one thing you</p>
<p t="1542480" d="4270">can say that is that the reason for that is
that the economic system is unjust and they</p>
<p t="1546750" d="4460">are layered along the bottom and that is the
fundamental cause of their suffering.</p>
<p t="1551210" d="5650">But Nietzsche does not allow that to be a
causal interpretation because he says there</p>
<p t="1556860" d="3659">are multiple ways of interpreting your position.</p>
<p t="1560519" d="7691">Near absence of material luxury does not necessarily
destine you to one perspective or another.</p>
<p t="1568210" d="1809">physiological degeneration.</p>
<p t="1570019" d="4871">People are unhappy or suffering because they
are ill in some manner.</p>
<p t="1574890" d="4490">You could make that a matter of definition
by saying, that if you&#39;re suffering or unhappy,</p>
<p t="1579380" d="1240">you are ill.</p>
<p t="1580620" d="1770">But that is not a causal argument.</p>
<p t="1582390" d="2600">It is just a different way of categorizing
the data.</p>
<p t="1584990" d="6689">Nietzche would reject that because he would
also note that there is some correlation between</p>
<p t="1591679" d="3321">physiological health and meaning in life.</p>
<p t="1595000" d="3899">But the correlation does not imply causality.</p>
<p t="1598899" d="4601">Even if it did, the relationship is by no
means perfect to the degree that you would</p>
<p t="1603500" d="4960">want a relationship to be before you accepted
it as relevant.</p>
<p t="1608460" d="4540">Or corruption of all things, that would be
the idea that being itself is evil, like an</p>
<p t="1613000" d="4470">evil trick, which is what Tolstoy said, by
the way, when he wrote his confessions.</p>
<p t="1617470" d="4329">Tolstoy, at the height of his intellectual
power, he was the most famous novelist in</p>
<p t="1621799" d="4021">the world and unbelievably well regarded well
throughout the world, but particularly in</p>
<p t="1625820" d="1000">Russia.</p>
<p t="1626820" d="4260">He was a very socially benevolent man and
well regarded for his wisdom.</p>
<p t="1631080" d="4130">For years he was afraid to go outside with
a rope or a gun because he thought he would</p>
<p t="1635210" d="1920">either hang or shoot himself.</p>
<p t="1637130" d="8690">The reason for that was that he had been struck
by the idea that life is so unbearable, that</p>
<p t="1645820" d="1000">it should be eradicated.</p>
<p t="1646820" d="7410">He could not think his way out of that.</p>
<p t="1654230" d="5179">it was a form of thought that was actually
very characteristic of intellectuals in Russia</p>
<p t="1659409" d="5411">during his time and in his place.</p>
<p t="1664820" d="5760">Dostoyevsky wrote about exactly the same sorts
of things.</p>
<p t="1670580" d="5370">Even Tolstoy noticed that merely observing
that the world was a corrupt and evil place</p>
<p t="1675950" d="3910">was not necessarily enough to tilt people
towards nihilism because there seem to be</p>
<p t="1679860" d="5480">people who weren&#39;t nihilistic despite the
fact that that seem self-evident to him.</p>
<p t="1685340" d="5600">Tolstoy actually turned to the Russian people,
you know what he was very entranced by the</p>
<p t="1690940" d="6479">idea of the folk and folk wisdom, and he turned
to the Russian people as a source of new inspiration</p>
<p t="1697419" d="1850">like the peasantry.</p>
<p t="1699269" d="4071">Tolstoy actually fought for the freedom of
the peasantry and he felt that their simple</p>
<p t="1703340" d="6740">faith, so to speak, was something truly admirable
rather than something pathetic and weak from</p>
<p t="1710080" d="1329">an intellectual perspective.</p>
<p t="1711409" d="4980">He strove to emulate that criticism-less faith.</p>
<p t="1716389" d="4161">But of course he could not do it because once
you taking a bite out of apple, there is no</p>
<p t="1720550" d="2239">going back, so to speak.</p>
<p t="1722789" d="4620">Nietzsche says, distress, whether psychic,
physical or intellectual, need not at all</p>
<p t="1727409" d="1451">produce nihilism.</p>
<p t="1728860" d="3480">That is, the radical rejection of value, meaning
and desirability.</p>
<p t="1732340" d="3360">Such distress always permits a variety of
interpretations.</p>
<p t="1735700" d="4349">Rather, it is one particular interpretation,
the Christian moral one, that nihilism is</p>
<p t="1740049" d="1000">rooted.</p>
<p t="1741049" d="5041">The end of Christianity, at the hands of its
own morality, which cannot be replaced.</p>
<p t="1746090" d="1719">Which turns against the Christian God.</p>
<p t="1747809" d="4811">The sense of truthfulness, highly developed
by Christianity is nauseated by the falseness</p>
<p t="1752620" d="5010">and mendaciousness of all Christian interpretations
of the world and of history.</p>
<p t="1757630" d="5429">It is a rebound from God is the truth to the
equally fanatical faith.</p>
<p t="1763059" d="1330">All is false.</p>
<p t="1764389" d="2561">An act of Buddhism.</p>
<p t="1766950" d="3699">Scepticism regarding morality is what is decisive.</p>
<p t="1770649" d="4171">The end of the moral interpretation of the
world, which no longer has any sanction after</p>
<p t="1774820" d="3760">it&#39;s tried to escape into some beyond, leads
to nihilism.</p>
<p t="1778580" d="1080">All lacks meaning.</p>
<p t="1779660" d="4700">That is rooted in Nietzsche&#39;s criticism of
Christianity because he believed that Christianity</p>
<p t="1784360" d="4990">was exceptionally morally flawed because all
it offered its followers was the possibility</p>
<p t="1789350" d="5200">of salvation and redemption from their suffering
after they were dead.</p>
<p t="1794550" d="3290">It was projected into some other world.</p>
<p t="1797840" d="4290">As far as Nietzsche was concerned, alleviated
people of their local responsibility to try</p>
<p t="1802130" d="1960">to improve things here and now</p>
<p t="1804090" d="6179">and Jung&#39;s comments about that were essentially,
that it was the proto-scientists recognition</p>
<p t="1810269" d="6040">of the fact that the spiritual salvation that
Christianity promised was no longer sufficient,</p>
<p t="1816309" d="2531">that motivated the development of science.</p>
<p t="1818840" d="5610">So, for the early Christians this is part
of the tension between Christianity and science.</p>
<p t="1824450" d="6710">For the early Christians, the idea was that
the earth in some sense was ineradicably corrupt.</p>
<p t="1831160" d="5570">That all you can hope for in your earthly
life was suffering and that you should accept</p>
<p t="1836730" d="5980">your suffering and hope for salvation in the
future after you&#39;re dead.</p>
<p t="1842710" d="4750">Obviously that philosophy appeared insufficient
for people.</p>
<p t="1847460" d="5240">In Jung&#39;s hypothesis about the development
of science was that a counter fantasy developed</p>
<p t="1852700" d="3569">in the unconscious of the Europeans which
was that</p>
<p t="1856269" d="5821">the material realm, which had been defined
as evil, and therefore not worthy of any study</p>
<p t="1862090" d="5660">or any pursuit whatsoever actually held the
seeds of the redemption that was lacking.</p>
<p t="1867750" d="5200">That was Jung&#39;s commentary on the idea of
the philosopher&#39;s stone because the alchemists,</p>
<p t="1872950" d="5400">who were proto-scientists, were trying to
find a material substance that would be the</p>
<p t="1878350" d="9360">philosopher&#39;s stone that would offer its holders
wealth, health and eternal life.</p>
<p t="1887710" d="2179">Why are we pursuing science?</p>
<p t="1889889" d="6520">Well, hopefully, because we think it will
do us some good here and now, in our bodies.</p>
<p t="1896409" d="7270">Jung regarded science itself as stemming from
that compensatory dream, brilliant idea.</p>
<p t="1903679" d="5821">It is actually the only idea I have ever read
that seems to do a reasonable psychological</p>
<p t="1909500" d="3550">account for the emergence of science as a
discipline.</p>
<p t="1913050" d="2240">It is a very strange practice.</p>
<p t="1915290" d="5859">You have to narrow your interests tremendously
to be a scientist.</p>
<p t="1921149" d="5341">You have to focus on one set of phenomena
that might appear as useless to contemplate</p>
<p t="1926490" d="2590">as how many angels can dance on the head of
a pin.</p>
<p t="1929080" d="5729">You have to devote decades to the study of
that thing to make incremental progress.</p>
<p t="1934809" d="2911">Why in the world would people ever be motivated
to do that?</p>
<p t="1937720" d="6520">Jung&#39;s interpretation was, there was a deep
counter movement towards the over spiritualisation</p>
<p t="1944240" d="6860">of the psyche and that was the revaluation
of matter and its possibilities.</p>
<p t="1951100" d="4390">While Nietzsche believed that Christianity
as it stood, at the end of the 1800s, was</p>
<p t="1955490" d="5410">an untenable philosophy because he thought
it had abandoned its moral obligations by</p>
<p t="1960900" d="5470">escaping into some beyond, and therefore damned
life as it was actually lived by human beings.</p>
<p t="1966370" d="5330">He felt that the demise was a good thing.</p>
<p t="1971700" d="1780">He points out one other thing.</p>
<p t="1973480" d="4390">This is the difference between having a theory
and then learning to theorize.</p>
<p t="1977870" d="3899">He says look, if you have been raised in the
tradition, whatever that tradition happens</p>
<p t="1981769" d="4601">to be, you have a belief system, whatever
that belief system happens to be, and it falls</p>
<p t="1986370" d="2570">apart on you, at any one point</p>
<p t="1988940" d="1890">you suffer for two reasons.</p>
<p t="1990830" d="4959">The first is, your belief system fell apart
and that is not a good thing.</p>
<p t="1995789" d="4411">It leaves everything unfixed and open, and
you drown in possibility, in a sense.</p>
<p t="2000200" d="2140">That is a Kierkegaard phrase.</p>
<p t="2002340" d="2550">But the second consequence is even worse.</p>
<p t="2004890" d="3620">Once you&#39;ve learned that one belief system
that is solid could be demolished and fall</p>
<p t="2008510" d="5289">apart, then it&#39;s very difficult ever again
to have any faith in any belief systems whatsoever.</p>
<p t="2013799" d="5500">Not only do you become a doubter of your own
creed, you become a Meta doubter, which is</p>
<p t="2019299" d="1891">the doubter of all belief systems.</p>
<p t="2021190" d="4550">The step from that to nihilism, maybe those
are exactly the same thing.</p>
<p t="2025740" d="4990">You could think about that in some sense as
the disease of the critical rational mind.</p>
<p t="2030730" d="3160">It can saw off any branch that it is sitting
on.</p>
<p t="2033890" d="2409">And you know the utility of that is?</p>
<p t="2036299" d="1581">Leave no stone unturned, right?</p>
<p t="2037880" d="1470">You are supposed to question things.</p>
<p t="2039350" d="2650">The utility of that is, you learn new things.</p>
<p t="2042000" d="6409">But the price you pay for it, is that you
are not necessarily ever certain about anything.</p>
<p t="2048409" d="4781">You could say, maybe you shouldn&#39;t be certain
about anything but you can forget that.</p>
<p t="2053190" d="4699">You are going to have to act as if you are
certain many times in your life.</p>
<p t="2057889" d="4321">When you choose a permanent mate, for example,
if you do that which you probably will, because</p>
<p t="2062210" d="4310">you&#39;re university educated and university
educated people still do that.</p>
<p t="2066520" d="1790">Although no one else does.</p>
<p t="2068310" d="4910">So, you are going to pick a career and you
are going to make decisions, one after the</p>
<p t="2073220" d="3550">other about which, if you are not certain,
you cannot make.</p>
<p t="2076770" d="1909">In which case you have no life.</p>
<p t="2078679" d="5470">You are just a whirlwind of chaos, so you
are stuck with the necessity of following</p>
<p t="2084149" d="6210">a course of action, which is acted out certainty
that your intellect cannot regard as appropriate.</p>
<p t="2090359" d="2921">And that is hard on people.</p>
<p t="2093280" d="3320">Why should I choose this instead of this?</p>
<p t="2096600" d="4250">Why should I act this way instead of that
way?</p>
<p t="2100850" d="4490">I do not know is not a very useful answer
when you are a creature that is cognitively</p>
<p t="2105340" d="8080">able, as we are.</p>
<p t="2113420" d="2250">This is something absolutely brilliant.</p>
<p t="2115670" d="6399">It is very difficult for me to believe that
it was written so long ago.</p>
<p t="2122069" d="8691">So this is Dostoyevsky&#39;s criticism of communism
forty years before communism was a political</p>
<p t="2130760" d="1260">force.</p>
<p t="2132020" d="3380">Dostoyevsky&#39;s thinking really hard about this
nihilism problem.</p>
<p t="2135400" d="2530">By the way, Nietzsche read Dostoyevsky quite
extensively.</p>
<p t="2137930" d="1141">He is thinking about it.</p>
<p t="2139071" d="3479">He thinks well, there seems to be two alternatives.</p>
<p t="2142550" d="4140">One is this superhuman nihilism, which is
sort of a variant of what Nietzsche proposed,</p>
<p t="2146690" d="3929">because Nietzsche proposed that</p>
<p t="2150619" d="4240">it would become the responsibility of every
human being after the death of their religious</p>
<p t="2154859" d="3321">tradition, to establish their own values.</p>
<p t="2158180" d="4250">He did not think people could do it.</p>
<p t="2162430" d="4050">He thought there&#39;d have to be a new kind of
person who could manage it, because you know,</p>
<p t="2166480" d="6750">he is basically asking you to generate a coherent
and pragmatically applicable philosophical</p>
<p t="2173230" d="4240">structure, out of nothing, during your lifetime.</p>
<p t="2177470" d="1250">Good luck with that.</p>
<p t="2178720" d="5470">You know, plus, he assumed that people create
values or that they could create values.</p>
<p t="2184190" d="1440">That is true to some degree.</p>
<p t="2185630" d="3670">We&#39;ll talk about this more when we get into
the phenomenological end of things.</p>
<p t="2189300" d="1910">But it is not self-evident, right?</p>
<p t="2191210" d="4610">Because one of the things you may notice is
that you cannot force yourself to love someone,</p>
<p t="2195820" d="1000">right?</p>
<p t="2196820" d="4070">But you cannot just decide to value someone
and then, poof, that happens.</p>
<p t="2200890" d="5070">In fact, you may want with all your heart,
or at least with all your mind, to value someone</p>
<p t="2205960" d="1280">because they deserve it.</p>
<p t="2207240" d="1790">They had never mistreated you.</p>
<p t="2209030" d="3670">Maybe you&#39;ve said you would be loyal to them,
and poof, someone comes along and you&#39;re tremendously</p>
<p t="2212700" d="6600">attracted to them and off you go, like someone
who is possessed.</p>
<p t="2219300" d="3529">Well, did you create that value?</p>
<p t="2222829" d="5581">And then, closer to your own experience, can
you actually make yourself interested in something</p>
<p t="2228410" d="2350">you are bored about?</p>
<p t="2230760" d="1220">Good luck trying that, you know.</p>
<p t="2231980" d="3960">You&#39;d rather clean up underneath your bed
than read a paper you do not want to read.</p>
<p t="2235940" d="4230">You cannot just tell yourself, well, I need
to read this paper for the following reasons,</p>
<p t="2240170" d="2220">and proof, it becomes interesting.</p>
<p t="2242390" d="5320">No no, your value systems, whatever they happen
to be, are off doing their own thing.</p>
<p t="2247710" d="3740">The reason for that, in large part, is because
they&#39;re possessed by ideas that you do not</p>
<p t="2251450" d="1000">know about,</p>
<p t="2252450" d="5270">that have these historical roots and that
play you in some sense, like they play puppets</p>
<p t="2257720" d="1350">and the stuff is no joke.</p>
<p t="2259070" d="3920">Okay so this is what Dostoyevsky said, way
back in the late 1800s.</p>
<p t="2262990" d="6830">This was in a book called &quot;Notes from Underground&quot;,
and it is about a man who is like Hamlet.</p>
<p t="2269820" d="2460">In some sense, he is a modern man.</p>
<p t="2272280" d="5460">He&#39;s a 20th century man really and his problem
is, he is hyper- intelligent and he cannot</p>
<p t="2277740" d="2230">figure out what the hell he should do with
his life.</p>
<p t="2279970" d="1540">And it is really bothering him</p>
<p t="2281510" d="4090">and it is worse than that, because not only
is it really bothering him, that he cannot</p>
<p t="2285600" d="4630">get his act together, and act with any degree
of consistency in character,</p>
<p t="2290230" d="1410">but he knows, that he cannot do that.</p>
<p t="2291640" d="2689">And he tortures himself about his weakness
at the same time.</p>
<p t="2294329" d="1821">So he is a very neurotic character.</p>
<p t="2296150" d="2939">But he is a sophisticated and intelligent
neurotic.</p>
<p t="2299089" d="4542">And so he has run through all the arguments
that you might conjure up, to sort of, talk</p>
<p t="2303631" d="2069">yourself out of being neurotic and suffering.</p>
<p t="2305700" d="2419">He has nothing but contempt for his own character.</p>
<p t="2308119" d="5191">He thinks he is much weaker than people, who
can just act without thinking.</p>
<p t="2313310" d="2080">And he&#39;s in this pit, this horrible pit.</p>
<p t="2315390" d="1830">And it is a wonderful thing to read.</p>
<p t="2317220" d="6399">It is quite blackly comical and it is a great
philosophical and psychological study.</p>
<p t="2323619" d="7161">Anyways, in one of the sections of this book,
Dostoyevsky&#39;s protagonist, starts to talk</p>
<p t="2330780" d="6560">about alternatives to his nihilistic hopelessness.
and he thinks about utopianism as a potential</p>
<p t="2337340" d="1000">alternative.</p>
<p t="2338340" d="3229">So what is utopianism?</p>
<p t="2341569" d="8891">Well, in some sense, medieval Christianity
promised people redemption after they died.</p>
<p t="2350460" d="7540">While a utopian creed does the same thing,
except it promises it, here and now.</p>
<p t="2358000" d="4079">Communism was a particular utopian creed and
fascism had the same element.</p>
<p t="2362079" d="11040">Although it was, I do not know how to describe,
it was less intellectually sophisticated than</p>
<p t="2373119" d="1000">communism.</p>
<p t="2374119" d="5931">Communists basically said look, if you guys
just stop being selfish and share, we can</p>
<p t="2380050" d="4410">transform the world into a place where everyone
will have enough of everything, and everyone</p>
<p t="2384460" d="2780">will be able to do what they want to do.</p>
<p t="2387240" d="5620">And because of the natural goodness of people,
if selfishness can be overcome, that will</p>
<p t="2392860" d="2830">be the next best thing to a paradise.</p>
<p t="2395690" d="4600">It was a powerful idea for people, you know?</p>
<p t="2400290" d="7550">80 years of our history was spent assessing
and battling out the validity of that idea.</p>
<p t="2407840" d="4680">Hundreds of millions of people died as a consequence
of it.</p>
<p t="2412520" d="1730">And you can understand why it was so attractive.</p>
<p t="2414250" d="6240">I mean, still utopian ideologies are attractive
to people and it is hard to read radical Islam</p>
<p t="2420490" d="2700">as anything other than a utopian ideology.</p>
<p t="2423190" d="6090">You know, the idea is, once you establish
rigid sharia, then poof, you know, you got</p>
<p t="2429280" d="3140">the kingdom of God on earth.</p>
<p t="2432420" d="4939">And part of the reason that the radical Muslims
are fighting against the West, is because</p>
<p t="2437359" d="5831">they see what they are doing as a counter
position to Western nihilism.</p>
<p t="2443190" d="3480">And is partly because they do not want to
fall into that, you know.</p>
<p t="2446670" d="2310">We would say well that is progress.</p>
<p t="2448980" d="5270">Yeah, it is progress, by our standards, and
it comes at a price.</p>
<p t="2454250" d="4140">and also we do not even understand how it
was that we paid the price.</p>
<p t="2458390" d="6060">So the reason I am telling you this, is because,
you do not be thinking, for any time at all,</p>
<p t="2464450" d="3780">that these sorts of issues have disappeared
or that they are not relevant.</p>
<p t="2468230" d="1230">They&#39;re relevant.</p>
<p t="2469460" d="2670">Now the guy who is advising Putin.</p>
<p t="2472130" d="4800">His name is Alexander Dugan and he is no admirer
of Western liberalism.</p>
<p t="2476930" d="2270">He thinks about it as fundamentally nihilistic.</p>
<p t="2479200" d="6540">He thinks that its universal application would
result in the dissolution of all local culture</p>
<p t="2485740" d="6380">and the production of this sort of materialistic
hyper- individuality.</p>
<p t="2492120" d="2719">He&#39;s an admirer of tradition.</p>
<p t="2494839" d="3141">And you know, specifically Russian Orthodox
tradition.</p>
<p t="2497980" d="4940">And he believes that the cultures, India,
Russia and China in particular, should develop</p>
<p t="2502920" d="5159">their own local cultures, keep the West the
hell out, and act as a counter position to</p>
<p t="2508079" d="1901">nihilistic liberalism.</p>
<p t="2509980" d="4410">Now you know, you can say what you want about
that.</p>
<p t="2514390" d="6520">I think Dugan&#39;s biggest problem is that, you
know, he does not want that the diverse ideas</p>
<p t="2520910" d="4449">that characterize the West to bump up against
Russia and dissolve it.</p>
<p t="2525359" d="5171">But what he fails to understand is those same
ideas are going to emerge within Russia, anyways</p>
<p t="2530530" d="4520">and if you know, if you want to keep them
away outside, you have to keep them away inside</p>
<p t="2535050" d="5120">and the Soviets already tried that for 70
years with pretty dire results.</p>
<p t="2540170" d="7580">So I don&#39;t think he can get around the problem
merely by putting up walls, but he is going</p>
<p t="2547750" d="1500">to try.</p>
<p t="2549250" d="1750">And that is what Putin is doing.</p>
<p t="2551000" d="2329">So these ideas haven&#39;t disappeared at all.</p>
<p t="2553329" d="4981">They underlie all of the great conflicts that
characterize the modern age.</p>
<p t="2558310" d="6350">Dostoyevsky criticized utopianism and it its
brilliant, his formulation, so I am going</p>
<p t="2564660" d="1820">to read it to you.</p>
<p t="2566480" d="4720">In short, one may say anything about the history
of the world.</p>
<p t="2571200" d="3419">Anything that might enter the most disordered
imagination.</p>
<p t="2574619" d="3091">The only thing one can say is that it is rational.</p>
<p t="2577710" d="5750">The very word sticks in one&#39;s throat, and
indeed, this is the odd thing that is continually</p>
<p t="2583460" d="1000">happening.</p>
<p t="2584460" d="5240">They&#39;re continually turning up in life, moral
and rational persons, sages and lovers of</p>
<p t="2589700" d="4129">humanity, who make it their object to live
all their lives as morally and rationally</p>
<p t="2593829" d="1221">as possible.</p>
<p t="2595050" d="4980">To be, so to speak, alike to their neighbours,
simply in order to show them that it is possible</p>
<p t="2600030" d="2780">to live morally and rationally in this world.</p>
<p t="2602810" d="3650">And yet we all know that these very people,
soon or later, have been false to themselves</p>
<p t="2606460" d="6139">playing some queer trick, often a most unseemly
one.</p>
<p t="2612599" d="5821">Now I ask you: what can be expected of man
since he is a being endowed with such strange</p>
<p t="2618420" d="1000">qualities?</p>
<p t="2619420" d="3270">Shower upon him every earthly blessing.</p>
<p t="2622690" d="5130">Drown him in a sea of happiness, so that nothing
but bubbles of bliss can be seen on the surface.</p>
<p t="2627820" d="4820">Give him economic prosperity, such that he
should have nothing else to do but sleep,</p>
<p t="2632640" d="5360">eat cakes and busy himself with the continuation
of his species.</p>
<p t="2638000" d="5810">And even then out of sheer ingratitude, sheer
spite, man would play you some nasty trick.</p>
<p t="2643810" d="6650">He would even risk his cakes and would deliberately
desire the most fatal rubbish, the most uneconomical</p>
<p t="2650460" d="6540">absurdity, simply to introduce into all this
positive good sense, his fatal fantastic element.</p>
<p t="2657000" d="5520">It is just his fantastic dreams, his vulgar
folly that he will desire to retain, simply</p>
<p t="2662520" d="5059">in order to prove to himself, as though that
were so necessary,</p>
<p t="2667579" d="4721">that men still are men, and not the keys of
a piano, which the laws of nature threaten</p>
<p t="2672300" d="4559">to control completely, so completely, that
one will be able to desire nothing but by</p>
<p t="2676859" d="2351">the calendar.</p>
<p t="2679210" d="5970">Clearly that is Dostoyevsky&#39;s criticism of
materialistic determinism, which he felt as</p>
<p t="2685180" d="7189">a spiritual threat fundamentally, its proposition
being that animals and human beings were deterministic</p>
<p t="2692369" d="1000">machines.</p>
<p t="2693369" d="4571">It is a Newtonian worldview and because of
that, everything could be calculated and planned</p>
<p t="2697940" d="7030">ahead of time, because it could be predicted
and measured, and that is not all.</p>
<p t="2704970" d="4730">Even if man really were nothing but a piano
key, even if this were proved to him by natural</p>
<p t="2709700" d="4430">science and mathematics, even then he would
not become reasonable, but would purposely</p>
<p t="2714130" d="4949">do something perverse out of simple ingratitude,
simply to gain his point.</p>
<p t="2719079" d="6001">And if he does not find means, he will contrive
destruction and chaos, sufferings of all sorts,</p>
<p t="2725080" d="1730">only to gain his point.</p>
<p t="2726810" d="6309">He will launch a curse upon the world, and
as only man can curse, it is his privilege,</p>
<p t="2733119" d="4111">and the primary distinction between him and
other animals, maybe by his curse alone he</p>
<p t="2737230" d="5600">will attain his object and convince himself
that he is a man and not a piano key.</p>
<p t="2742830" d="5320">If you say that all this, too, can be calculated
and tabulated, chaos and darkness and curses,</p>
<p t="2748150" d="5400">so that the mere possibility of calculating
it all beforehand would stop it all, and reason</p>
<p t="2753550" d="4430">would reassert itself, then man would purposely
go mad in order to be rid of reason and gain</p>
<p t="2757980" d="1020">his point.</p>
<p t="2759000" d="1640">I believe in it, I answer for it.</p>
<p t="2760640" d="3929">For the whole work of man really seems to
consist in nothing but proving to himself</p>
<p t="2764569" d="4051">every minute that he is a man and not a piano
key.</p>
<p t="2768620" d="2610">It may be at the cost of his skin.</p>
<p t="2771230" d="3410">It might be by cannibalism.</p>
<p t="2774640" d="5209">And this being so, can one help being tempted
to rejoice that it has not yet come off, and</p>
<p t="2779849" d="3951">that desire still depends on something we
don&#39;t know?</p>
<p t="2783800" d="3640">You will scream at me, that is, if you condescend
to do so.</p>
<p t="2787440" d="4030">That no one is touching my free will, that
all they&#39;re concerned with is that my will</p>
<p t="2791470" d="6869">should of, should of itself, of its own free
will, coincide with my own normal interests,</p>
<p t="2798339" d="2901">with the laws of nature, and arithmetic.</p>
<p t="2801240" d="3910">Good heavens gentleman, what sort of free
will is left when we come to tabulation and</p>
<p t="2805150" d="1000">arithmetic.</p>
<p t="2806150" d="4469">When it will all be a case of twice two makes
four.</p>
<p t="2810619" d="2250">Twice two makes four without my will.</p>
<p t="2812869" d="5171">As if free will meant that.</p>
<p t="2818040" d="2150">So what&#39;s his point?</p>
<p t="2820190" d="3780">It&#39;s sort of a Garden of Eden point, you know?</p>
<p t="2823970" d="1649">What are people like?</p>
<p t="2825619" d="4491">Imagine you can reconstruct a paradise on
earth?</p>
<p t="2830110" d="1000">You know?</p>
<p t="2831110" d="1000">Hypothetically that&#39;s what everyone wants.</p>
<p t="2832110" d="2920">We can go live in a paradise, and that would
be the end of the problem.</p>
<p t="2835030" d="1640">We&#39;d all live happily ever after.</p>
<p t="2836670" d="4970">But in the original paradise story, that&#39;s
what people were provided with.</p>
<p t="2841640" d="3490">And the first thing they did when they were
put there, was to do the one thing that they</p>
<p t="2845130" d="2670">were told not to do, that would bring it all
crashing down.</p>
<p t="2847800" d="2430">And that was immediately what they did.</p>
<p t="2850230" d="3670">And so Dostoyevsky&#39;s stories are actually
a retelling of that idea.</p>
<p t="2853900" d="4820">The idea was that people aren&#39;t like the utopians
think.</p>
<p t="2858720" d="1109">We don&#39;t want it easy.</p>
<p t="2859829" d="2281">We don&#39;t want it comfortable.</p>
<p t="2862110" d="1000">We don&#39;t want it good.</p>
<p t="2863110" d="2540">And the reason for that is, we&#39;d be bored
stiff.</p>
<p t="2865650" d="4530">And so that if anybody ever did put us in
the kind of nursery, that would require us</p>
<p t="2870180" d="5490">never to exert any effort to do anything at
all whatsoever ever again, even if it meant</p>
<p t="2875670" d="2750">going insane, we&#39;d destroy it.</p>
<p t="2878420" d="6290">And then he takes that further, he says, and
that is a good thing.</p>
<p t="2884710" d="5930">Kierkegaard writing earlier, about 40 years
earlier, said something quite similar.</p>
<p t="2890640" d="3240">It is now about four years ago that I got
the notion of wanting to try my luck as an</p>
<p t="2893880" d="3719">author I remember quite clearly, it was on
a Sunday.</p>
<p t="2897599" d="2151">Yes, that is it, a Sunday afternoon.</p>
<p t="2899750" d="5970">I was seated as usual, out-of-doors at the
caf� in the Fredericksburg garden.</p>
<p t="2905720" d="3550">I had been a student for half a score of years.</p>
<p t="2909270" d="5210">Although never lazy, all my activity, nevertheless
was like a glittering inactivity, a kind of</p>
<p t="2914480" d="4930">occupation for which I still have great partiality
and for which, perhaps, I even have a little</p>
<p t="2919410" d="1000">genius.</p>
<p t="2920410" d="5640">I read much, spent the remainder of the day
idling and thinking, or thinking and idling,</p>
<p t="2926050" d="1820">but that was all it came to.</p>
<p t="2927870" d="3760">So there I sat and smoked my cigar until I
lapsed into thought.</p>
<p t="2931630" d="2929">Among other thoughts I remember these.</p>
<p t="2934559" d="6711">You are going on, I said to myself, to become
an old man without being anything and really</p>
<p t="2941270" d="2870">without undertaking to do anything.</p>
<p t="2944140" d="3200">On the other hand, wherever you look about
you in literature and in life, you see the</p>
<p t="2947340" d="4840">celebrated names and figures, the precious
and much heralded men, who were coming into</p>
<p t="2952180" d="2590">prominence and are much talked about.</p>
<p t="2954770" d="3820">the many benefactors of the age who know how
to benefit mankind by making life easier and</p>
<p t="2958590" d="1150">easier.</p>
<p t="2959740" d="5250">Some by railways, others by omnibuses and
steamboats others by the telegraph, others</p>
<p t="2964990" d="4440">quite easily apprehended compendiums and short
recitals of everything worth knowing.</p>
<p t="2969430" d="6060">Finally, the true benefactors of the age make
spiritual existence in virtue of thought easier</p>
<p t="2975490" d="3520">and easier yet more and more significant.</p>
<p t="2979010" d="1819">And what are you doing?</p>
<p t="2980829" d="7500">Here my soliloquy was interrupted for my cigar
was smoked out and a new one had to be lit.</p>
<p t="2988329" d="5230">So I smoked again, and then suddenly this
thought flashed through my mind.</p>
<p t="2993559" d="4901">You must do something, but inasmuch as with
your limited capacities will be impossible</p>
<p t="2998460" d="3070">to make anything easier than it has become.</p>
<p t="3001530" d="5460">You must, with the same humanitarian enthusiasm
as the others, undertake to make something</p>
<p t="3006990" d="1050">harder.</p>
<p t="3008040" d="4660">This notion pleased me immensely and at the
same time, it flattered me to think that I,</p>
<p t="3012700" d="4070">like the rest of them, would be loved and
esteemed by the whole community.</p>
<p t="3016770" d="4840">For when all combine in every way to make
everything easier, there remains only one</p>
<p t="3021610" d="1840">possible danger.</p>
<p t="3023450" d="4889">Namely, that the ease become so great, that
it becomes altogether too great.</p>
<p t="3028339" d="3911">Then there is only one want left, though it
is not yet felt want.</p>
<p t="3032250" d="1930">When people will want difficulty.</p>
<p t="3034180" d="5380">Out of love for mankind and out of despair
at my embarrassing situation, seeing that</p>
<p t="3039560" d="1600">I had accomplished nothing,</p>
<p t="3041160" d="4439">and was unable to make anything easier than
it already been made, and moved by a genuine</p>
<p t="3045599" d="6250">interest in those who make everything easy,
I conceived it as my task to create difficulties,</p>
<p t="3051849" d="1681">everywhere.</p>
<p t="3053530" d="8930">Now, one of the things you might ask yourself
is, sometimes you come to University and people</p>
<p t="3062460" d="1510">talk about happiness.</p>
<p t="3063970" d="2109">For example, they talk about positive psychology.</p>
<p t="3066079" d="4131">I am not a fan of positive psychology, by
the way.</p>
<p t="3070210" d="4940">Because happiness is basically extraversion
minus neuroticism and we knew that 15 years</p>
<p t="3075150" d="1000">ago.</p>
<p t="3076150" d="2800">So we didn&#39;t need to make a lot of noise about
it.</p>
<p t="3078950" d="6310">So anyways, one of the things you might ask
yourself is, well, why did you come to University?</p>
<p t="3085260" d="3950">Did you actually come to University to make
yourself happier?</p>
<p t="3089210" d="5830">Well, let&#39;s think about that for a minute.</p>
<p t="3095040" d="2920">Here&#39;s one thing to think about?</p>
<p t="3097960" d="4940">We know that if you put animals in a relatively
boring situation, like rats, in a boring situation</p>
<p t="3102900" d="4770">and you give them free access to cocaine,
they&#39;ll just take cocaine until they are dead</p>
<p t="3107670" d="1000">basically.</p>
<p t="3108670" d="4679">Now rats in a normal environment won&#39;t do
that, but bored rats that are sort of isolated,</p>
<p t="3113349" d="2421">cocaine is really an excellent thing, as far
as they are concerned.</p>
<p t="3115770" d="1860">They&#39;ll ignore sex, they&#39;ll ignore food.</p>
<p t="3117630" d="2969">I think they&#39;ll still drink water, if I remember
correctly.</p>
<p t="3120599" d="2361">But it is cocaine all the way.</p>
<p t="3122960" d="4339">And if you could inject an electrode into
their minds, their brains, which people have</p>
<p t="3127299" d="6331">done, you can inject the electrode down into
the hypothalamus, into the part that is associated</p>
<p t="3133630" d="1370">with the reward centres.</p>
<p t="3135000" d="5140">It is the source of the dopaminergic tract
and you can set them up so that if the rat</p>
<p t="3140140" d="4820">pushes a button, they get a jolt of happiness,
basically, and the rat will sit there and</p>
<p t="3144960" d="7270">push that happiness button in a rather frantic
way, as if it is looking for something else,</p>
<p t="3152230" d="1000">in some sense.</p>
<p t="3153230" d="3220">But it will certainly do it, because it is
a peculiar kind of reward.</p>
<p t="3156450" d="6600">Now the question might be, would you allow
yourself to be wired up like that?</p>
<p t="3163050" d="2930">Now you might think there might be some times
in your life where you think that might just</p>
<p t="3165980" d="5710">be perfectly fine idea, but most of you, I
suppose, I presume, wouldn&#39;t do that for second,</p>
<p t="3171690" d="4350">for the same reasons, perhaps, that you do
not avail yourself of unlimited access to</p>
<p t="3176040" d="1000">cocaine.</p>
<p t="3177040" d="3560">Which is a stimulant that is very good at
producing positive emotion.</p>
<p t="3180600" d="4600">It is a powerful psychomotor stimulant and
so it affects the parts of your brain that</p>
<p t="3185200" d="4500">are active when you are doing something that
you think is worthwhile and productive.</p>
<p t="3189700" d="1210">So why not just do that all the time?</p>
<p t="3190910" d="3960">That is the question that Aldous Huxley asked
in Brave New World.</p>
<p t="3194870" d="6370">You&#39;ve got everything you want, take a drug
to keep you calm and happy, poof; perfect.</p>
<p t="3201240" d="2599">Well, is that what you want?</p>
<p t="3203839" d="4551">And if answer is no, then you might ask yourself,
what the hell do you want?</p>
<p t="3208390" d="7280">You know, one of the things I thought a lot
about lately is, lately being 10 years, I</p>
<p t="3215670" d="1090">suppose is</p>
<p t="3216760" d="1670">there are these statues that I&#39;ve seen.</p>
<p t="3218430" d="1429">I&#39;ve looked at pictures of them online.</p>
<p t="3219859" d="5031">There are statues of Atlas, and you know Atlas,
he&#39;s this God who has the world on his shoulders.</p>
<p t="3224890" d="4260">And that is his destiny or his curse, to have
the world on his shoulders.</p>
<p t="3229150" d="2310">And he might say, well, you know, poor Atlas.</p>
<p t="3231460" d="4680">Maybe he should just put the damn world down
and you know, go out for a beer or something.</p>
<p t="3236140" d="7699">But then you might also think, well what is
that figure trying to, what is that that idea</p>
<p t="3243839" d="2501">trying to indicate cause it&#39;s an old idea.</p>
<p t="3246340" d="1800">It is a profound idea.</p>
<p t="3248140" d="3469">There&#39;s something divine about a figure with
the world on its shoulders.</p>
<p t="3251609" d="3750">Well, I might say that&#39;s the reason you are
in University whether you know it or not.</p>
<p t="3255359" d="7181">You are here to take the world on your shoulders,
because that is a sufficiently profound and</p>
<p t="3262540" d="6799">worthwhile exercise, so that all the suffering
that you are going to have, might be regarded</p>
<p t="3269339" d="1591">as worthwhile.</p>
<p t="3270930" d="3080">Because the value of what you are doing is
so high, because that is something you might</p>
<p t="3274010" d="6230">ask, is there something that you could do,
whose value is so high, that the fact,</p>
<p t="3280240" d="7059">for the existentialists, it&#39;s a fact, that
you&#39;re mortal and vulnerable and prone to</p>
<p t="3287299" d="2731">suffering, inescapably.</p>
<p t="3290030" d="2980">That you would find that not only acceptable,
but desirable.</p>
<p t="3293010" d="5380">You might say that you would pay that price.</p>
<p t="3298390" d="3380">You might say that is the existential question.</p>
<p t="3301770" d="2860">And one of the things it is very interesting
about that question.</p>
<p t="3304630" d="4140">I am going to talk about this a lot next class.</p>
<p t="3308770" d="5390">What happens if you make the opposite choice?</p>
<p t="3314160" d="3530">I think the 20th century actually showed us
what happened when people made the opposite</p>
<p t="3317690" d="1919">choice.</p>
<p t="3319609" d="8700">Because as far as I can tell, when people
abandon their Divine responsibility, let us</p>
<p t="3328309" d="7351">say, to the utopian claims of a totalitarian
state, or to hopeless nihilism,</p>
<p t="3335660" d="7189">the consequence on the one hand, with nihilism
was despair and illness, and the consequence</p>
<p t="3342849" d="5200">on the totalitarian end of things, the utopian
end was that you might not die, but you are</p>
<p t="3348049" d="4911">certainly going to have a hand in making sure
that a lot of other people do.</p>
<p t="3352960" d="11060">And so, to some degree it depends on what
you want for proof with regards to what you</p>
<p t="3364020" d="1329">should do.</p>
<p t="3365349" d="5541">Now, the conclusion I have drawn from all
this, from reading the existentialist is that,</p>
<p t="3370890" d="8300">if it is the pointless suffering of humanity
and the inability to extract meaning from</p>
<p t="3379190" d="3690">that, that makes you a nihilist and that justifies
it, let us say.</p>
<p t="3382880" d="1560">You are making a claim right?</p>
<p t="3384440" d="6419">The claim is, the implicit claim is, that
suffering is bad and should be halted.</p>
<p t="3390859" d="1421">It is something like that.</p>
<p t="3392280" d="4390">And so maybe you will do that by becoming
suicidal or maybe you do that by becoming</p>
<p t="3396670" d="5730">ultimately genocidal, which is also an option
that&#39;s open to more than a few people.</p>
<p t="3402400" d="6630">But there is a logical inconsistency in that
as far as I can tell which is that your initial</p>
<p t="3409030" d="2829">presupposition is that the suffering is actually
bad.</p>
<p t="3411859" d="1000">It should be mitigated.</p>
<p t="3412859" d="1851">That should be it should be reduced.</p>
<p t="3414710" d="2950">It should perhaps even be eliminated.</p>
<p t="3417660" d="5560">If you pick up the cloak of nihilism, or maybe
you pick up the cloak of ideological totalitarianism,</p>
<p t="3423220" d="3629">then we know what the consequence of that
is.</p>
<p t="3426849" d="4471">The consequence is that everything that is
already really bad, becomes so much worse,</p>
<p t="3431320" d="3420">that it is almost unimaginable.</p>
<p t="3434740" d="6119">And so, even by the standards of the nihilist,
who says that the suffering of being should</p>
<p t="3440859" d="4051">result in its elimination.</p>
<p t="3444910" d="4020">The consequences of thinking that way, or
flipping to the other side and adopting some</p>
<p t="3448930" d="5530">sort of defensive ideology is that, things
go from being, you know, merely the sort of</p>
<p t="3454460" d="2820">bad state of the earth as it is now,</p>
<p t="3457280" d="5230">to something as hellish as the Soviet gulags,
or the Russian concentration camps or Mao&#39;s</p>
<p t="3462510" d="4460">great experiment in the cultural Revolution,
which probably killed 100 million people.</p>
<p t="3466970" d="5670">You know, about which we generally hear nothing.</p>
<p t="3472640" d="6520">Now you know one of the things the existentialist
would say is, what is the relationship between</p>
<p t="3479160" d="1980">mental health and responsibility?</p>
<p t="3481140" d="6820">Now that&#39;s a good question because it also
has to do with something like the definition</p>
<p t="3487960" d="2780">of mental health and responsibility.</p>
<p t="3490740" d="8089">It is like, if you want your life to be well
constituted, let us say, whatever that means.</p>
<p t="3498829" d="3631">And it does not mean being happy.</p>
<p t="3502460" d="3360">The reason it can&#39;t mean being happy is there&#39;s
going to be times in your life or you&#39;re to</p>
<p t="3505820" d="3630">be called on to act, when you are not happy.</p>
<p t="3509450" d="5490">So, for example, when one of your parents
dies, you&#39;re going to make a choice.</p>
<p t="3514940" d="1639">You are not going to be happy.</p>
<p t="3516579" d="2091">Hopefully, you won&#39;t be.</p>
<p t="3518670" d="1880">Otherwise you are tangled in some sort of
Freudian nightmare.</p>
<p t="3520550" d="2200">But let us assume that that is not the case.</p>
<p t="3522750" d="1640">You are not going to be happy about it.</p>
<p t="3524390" d="3550">You&#39;re going to be hurt and maybe even partly
broken.</p>
<p t="3527940" d="3020">So what the hell you supposed to do, then?</p>
<p t="3530960" d="2570">Well the answer is, you should be more use
than trouble.</p>
<p t="3533530" d="4680">Under some such circumstances, that&#39;s a good
thing to strive for, you know?</p>
<p t="3538210" d="1589">Because your mother would be, if it is your
father.</p>
<p t="3539799" d="3510">And your mother&#39;s to be equally distraught
and so are your siblings and everyone else</p>
<p t="3543309" d="1111">you care for.</p>
<p t="3544420" d="4010">Maybe by that time, you should be tough enough
so that in that situation, you are good for</p>
<p t="3548430" d="1070">something.</p>
<p t="3549500" d="2830">Someone has to make the damn funeral arrangements.</p>
<p t="3552330" d="2100">Someone has to settle out the will.</p>
<p t="3554430" d="4550">Someone has to make sure the family does not
degenerate into horrific squabbling, which</p>
<p t="3558980" d="4060">is something that often happens after the
death of a parent.</p>
<p t="3563040" d="2809">And you are not going to be motivated to do
that by happiness.</p>
<p t="3565849" d="4031">And what if you have a sick child, when you
are a parent.</p>
<p t="3569880" d="1219">Maybe it is a chronic illness.</p>
<p t="3571099" d="2171">You are not going to be happy about that.</p>
<p t="3573270" d="4890">You know it will be a weight that you carry
with you all the time and it is one of those</p>
<p t="3578160" d="1000">things.</p>
<p t="3579160" d="1690">It seems particularly unjust.</p>
<p t="3580850" d="2780">Then, you are no longer happy.</p>
<p t="3583630" d="4189">If being happy is the purpose of life, then
you are basically, that is pretty much it</p>
<p t="3587819" d="1740">for you.</p>
<p t="3589559" d="4421">And you know these catastrophes that I am
speaking of.</p>
<p t="3593980" d="5610">You can be certain that you are going to be
exposed to many of those during your life.</p>
<p t="3599590" d="1140">You know.</p>
<p t="3600730" d="5400">It will be a rare period, I think it is rare,
in anyone&#39;s life where one or more of such</p>
<p t="3606130" d="2229">things is not going on chronically.</p>
<p t="3608359" d="5220">It is not you, with some terrible health problem,
or some other terrible problem, then it is</p>
<p t="3613579" d="2581">a parent or a sibling or a child.</p>
<p t="3616160" d="3410">Because you know, you are connected to other
people and their vulnerable to so that is</p>
<p t="3619570" d="2100">the law of human beings.</p>
<p t="3621670" d="4040">And so if it is happiness and this is what
Solzhenitsyn said about happiness too.</p>
<p t="3625710" d="7810">He said happiness is a philosophy, who&#39;s brought
to ruin by the first blow of a guard&#39;s truncheon.</p>
<p t="3633520" d="8799">Like yeah, that is about as bluntly as you
can put it.</p>
<p t="3642319" d="11401">Here is another, I have time to read both
of these.</p>
<p t="3653720" d="4010">I think this is from Kierkegaard as well.</p>
<p t="3657730" d="6170">Kierkegaard, by the way, was really the first
thinker who identified what we would describe</p>
<p t="3663900" d="5969">in modern terms as anxiety, especially as
existential anxiety or angst.</p>
<p t="3669869" d="4861">And it would be associated with the condition
of questioning the nature of existence, the</p>
<p t="3674730" d="4200">utility of existence, and so Kierkegaard was
really the first person who formalized that</p>
<p t="3678930" d="4939">into something resembling a philosophy or
a psychology</p>
<p t="3683869" d="2931">and that he was trying to think about how
that might be overcome.</p>
<p t="3686800" d="4120">Given that it seemed to be rooted in fact,
the factual observation.</p>
<p t="3690920" d="3780">That is the observation of suffering</p>
<p t="3694700" d="5810">and this is a corollary to Dostoyevsky&#39;s comments
even though Kierkegaard&#39;s comments were written</p>
<p t="3700510" d="1950">decades earlier.</p>
<p t="3702460" d="8560">Dostoyevsky&#39;s critique basically said, you
cannot solve the problem of suffering by formalizing</p>
<p t="3711020" d="3599">a utopia and then enjoining it like a mass
animal.</p>
<p t="3714619" d="2541">You cannot do that because you are not that
kind of creature.</p>
<p t="3717160" d="4410">Even if it was possible, you would not accept
it, you cause trouble because you are interested</p>
<p t="3721570" d="1000">in trouble.</p>
<p t="3722570" d="4489">You are probably more interested in trouble
than you are at being happy.</p>
<p t="3727059" d="1941">So I mean, you know people like that.</p>
<p t="3729000" d="4220">That is another marker of serious personality
disorder, right?</p>
<p t="3733220" d="5629">I have clients, have many of them, who are
way more interested in causing trouble in</p>
<p t="3738849" d="3621">some dramatic way than they are in being boring
and stable.</p>
<p t="3742470" d="5030">They will take any form of suffering and inflict
any form of suffering on any number of people</p>
<p t="3747500" d="5240">they can possibly get their hooks into in
order merely to escape, you know, drab and</p>
<p t="3752740" d="1670">secure normality.</p>
<p t="3754410" d="4040">You know, you call those people dramatic,
overly dramatic.</p>
<p t="3758450" d="3700">That is one way of looking at it.</p>
<p t="3762150" d="3760">And they make, as far as I can tell, a relatively
conscious choice.</p>
<p t="3765910" d="6600">Trouble is more interesting than safety.</p>
<p t="3772510" d="3309">Kierkegaard says something similar.</p>
<p t="3775819" d="8351">But in 
a manner that is more constructive, in some</p>
<p t="3784170" d="4230">sense, with regards to what you should do
with all that insane energy that you are not</p>
<p t="3788400" d="4419">going to be able to encapsulate inside a utopia.</p>
<p t="3792819" d="3851">And it has to do with individual responsibility.</p>
<p t="3796670" d="4290">There is a view of life, which conceives that
where the crowd is, there is also the truth.</p>
<p t="3800960" d="4420">And then, in truth itself, there is need of
having the crowd on its side.</p>
<p t="3805380" d="2110">I was on a panel at one point about.</p>
<p t="3807490" d="7410">I think we were discussing gender differences
between, obviously between men and women and</p>
<p t="3814900" d="1020">there are lots of people.</p>
<p t="3815920" d="3600">The social constructionists, in particular,
who think that all the differences; there</p>
<p t="3819520" d="5210">is biological sex and then there is gender
and gender is socially constructed and that</p>
<p t="3824730" d="1690">all gender differences are socially constructed.</p>
<p t="3826420" d="4840">And there is no biological differences in
gender between the two sexes.</p>
<p t="3831260" d="3510">Now, virtually no evidence supports that proposition.</p>
<p t="3834770" d="3890">If you look at the hard-core psychological
evidence, in fact, it is completely the opposite.</p>
<p t="3838660" d="6120">And not only that, as you make societies more
egalitarian, men and women get more different,</p>
<p t="3844780" d="1850">instead of more the same.</p>
<p t="3846630" d="5080">Now the reason that happens is because, once
you iron out the environmental variability,</p>
<p t="3851710" d="4570">by equalizing everything, all that is left
is genetic variability.</p>
<p t="3856280" d="1499">So it springs to the forefront.</p>
<p t="3857779" d="5641">And so the biggest gender differences in the
world are between men and women in Scandinavia.</p>
<p t="3863420" d="2640">and those are partly personality differences.</p>
<p t="3866060" d="4490">Women are higher in negative emotion and more
agreeable, among other things, but more particularly,</p>
<p t="3870550" d="4069">the differences seem to be those of interest.</p>
<p t="3874619" d="3950">So the biggest differences between men and
women seem to be, what they are interested</p>
<p t="3878569" d="4591">in. and roughly speaking, women are more interested
in people and roughly speaking, men are more</p>
<p t="3883160" d="1000">interested in things.</p>
<p t="3884160" d="5369">And so in Scandinavia, for example, you have
20 to 1 proportion of women to men in nursing,</p>
<p t="3889529" d="4581">and a 20 to 1 proportion of men to women in
engineering.</p>
<p t="3894110" d="4489">And so, you know, the Scandinavia governments,
now and then, try to move that, so there are</p>
<p t="3898599" d="1730">more male nurses and more female engineers.</p>
<p t="3900329" d="4841">And if they really push, they can move the
ratios somewhat, for a few years.</p>
<p t="3905170" d="4190">But as they relax, they snap right back to
20 to 1.</p>
<p t="3909360" d="5009">So anyways, I was sighting some of these studies,
and one of the people that I was discussing</p>
<p t="3914369" d="4921">said, what are we supposed to do with that?</p>
<p t="3919290" d="1989">And I said, I do not know what you mean.</p>
<p t="3921279" d="1691">Those are scientific findings.</p>
<p t="3922970" d="3490">He said that, yeah, truth has to be established
by consensus.</p>
<p t="3926460" d="6109">And I thought I do not want to live in whatever
world you are going to end up ruling, because</p>
<p t="3932569" d="2750">truth is not merely established by consensus.</p>
<p t="3935319" d="1101">or if you think it does.</p>
<p t="3936420" d="3730">If you think it is, then while you are in
a position that Kierkegaard describes, which</p>
<p t="3940150" d="4139">is that, as long as everyone else believes
it, then the appropriate thing is for you</p>
<p t="3944289" d="2201">to believe it, and also that is the truth.</p>
<p t="3946490" d="5270">Like, it is a pretty damn dismal philosophy
and it gets people into tremendous trouble</p>
<p t="3951760" d="4230">because no matter how many people think there
isn&#39;t a wall there, anyone who runs at it</p>
<p t="3955990" d="2550">head first, is in for a vicious surprise.</p>
<p t="3958540" d="4420">There is a view of life, which conceives that
where the crowd is, there is also the truth</p>
<p t="3962960" d="2710">and in that truth, is in truth itself.</p>
<p t="3965670" d="1879">There is need of having a crowd on its side.</p>
<p t="3967549" d="7641">There is a view of life, which conceives that
wherever there is a crowd there is untruth.</p>
<p t="3975190" d="4210">So that to consider for a moment, the extreme
case.</p>
<p t="3979400" d="5780">Even if every individual, each for himself
in private, were to be in possession of the</p>
<p t="3985180" d="1000">truth.</p>
<p t="3986180" d="4700">Yet, in case they are all to get together
in a crowd, a crowd to which any sort of decisive</p>
<p t="3990880" d="5689">significance is attributed; avoiding, voting,
noisy, audible crowd, untruth would immediately</p>
<p t="3996569" d="3761">be in evidence.</p>
<p t="4000330" d="3040">For a crowd is the untruth.</p>
<p t="4003370" d="5209">In a godly sense, it is true, eternally, christianly,
as St. Paul says that only one attains the</p>
<p t="4008579" d="1000">goal.</p>
<p t="4009579" d="1701">Which is not meant in a comparative sense.</p>
<p t="4011280" d="2670">For comparison takes others into account.</p>
<p t="4013950" d="2930">It means that every individual can be that
one.</p>
<p t="4016880" d="2729">God helping them therein, but only one attains
the goal.</p>
<p t="4019609" d="5291">And again, this means that every man should
be careful about having to do with the others.</p>
<p t="4024900" d="3120">And essentially should only talk with God
himself.</p>
<p t="4028020" d="2309">For o
nly one attains the goal. and again this means</p>
<p t="4030329" d="3911">that man or to be a man is akin to deity.</p>
<p t="4034240" d="4760">In a worldly and temporal sense, it will be
said by the man of bustle, sociability and</p>
<p t="4039000" d="5309">amicableness, how unreasonable, that only
one attains the goal.</p>
<p t="4044309" d="4601">For is far more likely that many, by the strength
of united effort, should attain the goal.</p>
<p t="4048910" d="4580">And when we were many success is more certain,
and it is easier for each man severally.</p>
<p t="4053490" d="5099">True enough, it is far more likely, and it
is also true with respect to all earthly and</p>
<p t="4058589" d="1081">material goods.</p>
<p t="4059670" d="2600">If it is allowed to have its way.</p>
<p t="4062270" d="3200">However, this becomes the only true point
of view.</p>
<p t="4065470" d="3520">For it does away with God in eternity and
with man&#39;s kinship with deity.</p>
<p t="4068990" d="3879">It does away with it, or transforms it into
a fable.</p>
<p t="4072869" d="4611">And puts in its place, the modern, or we might
say the old pagan notion, that to be a man</p>
<p t="4077480" d="3310">is to belong to a race, endowed with reason.</p>
<p t="4080790" d="4850">To belong to it as a specimen, so that the
race or species is higher than the individual.</p>
<p t="4085640" d="3260">This is 100 years before Nazism.</p>
<p t="4088900" d="3910">Which is to say, that there are no more individuals,
but only specimens.</p>
<p t="4092810" d="5380">But, eternity which arches over and high above
the temporal.</p>
<p t="4098190" d="2600">Tranquil as the starry vault at night.</p>
<p t="4100790" d="4540">And God in heaven, who in the bliss of that
sublime tranquility, holds in survey, without</p>
<p t="4105330" d="4750">the least sense of dizziness at such a height,
those countless multitudes of men, and knows</p>
<p t="4110080" d="2320">each single individual by name.</p>
<p t="4112400" d="7450">He, the great examiner says that only one
attains the goal.</p>
<p t="4119850" d="4130">Kierkegaard was a Christian existentialist
Protestant.</p>
<p t="4123980" d="2620">Dostoyevsky was an Orthodox Christian existentialist.</p>
<p t="4126600" d="5370">And Nietzsche, who was also an existentialist,
was a, perhaps the most effective anti-Christian</p>
<p t="4131970" d="2110">philosopher who has ever existed.</p>
<p t="4134080" d="6830">And he made it one of his conscious aims,
to take a hammer to everything that was foundational</p>
<p t="4140910" d="3320">against what was left of Christianity at the
time that he existed.</p>
<p t="4144230" d="10740">The reason I am telling you this is because
existentialism is </p>
<p t="4154970" d="1000">a strange philosophy.</p>
<p t="4155970" d="4150">It brings people with very divergent fundamental
assumptions together.</p>
<p t="4160120" d="2710">They share certain assumptions.</p>
<p t="4162830" d="5200">And one assumption is that life, in its essence,
is suffering.</p>
<p t="4168030" d="6540">And the second is that the individual has
a responsibility to adopt responsibility in</p>
<p t="4174570" d="1000">the face of that suffering.</p>
<p t="4175570" d="5430">And that is the proper response the proper
response in the nihilism or ideological possession.</p>
<p t="4181000" d="5470">It is something else at something that depends
on the person themselves.</p>
<p t="4186470" d="2710">Nietzsche draws the same conclusions as Kierkegaard.</p>
<p t="4189180" d="6770">A traveller who had seen many countries and
peoples and several continents was asked what</p>
<p t="4195950" d="6970">human traits he had found everywhere, and
he answered, men are inclined to laziness.</p>
<p t="4202920" d="2340">Some will feel that he might have said with
greater justice.</p>
<p t="4205260" d="3450">They are all timid.</p>
<p t="4208710" d="3970">They hide behind customs and opinions.</p>
<p t="4212680" d="4050">At bottom, every human being knows very well
that he is in this world just once, as something</p>
<p t="4216730" d="6370">unique and that no accident, however strange,
will throw together a second time into a unity.</p>
<p t="4223100" d="2360">Such a curious and diffuse plurality.</p>
<p t="4225460" d="7660">He knows it, but hides it like a bad conscience.</p>
<p t="4233120" d="3230">Why?</p>
<p t="4236350" d="4690">The last lecture, when we were talking about
Rogers, not the video lecture, but last time</p>
<p t="4241040" d="2880">I talk to you about Rogers, I was talking
about instrumental speech.</p>
<p t="4243920" d="6000">And that is the speech that you engage in
that is inauthentic from Roger and existentialist</p>
<p t="4249920" d="1000">perspective.</p>
<p t="4250920" d="4890">When the goal of the speech is to extract
something from someone or something.</p>
<p t="4255810" d="2870">The goal is not mere clarity of communication.</p>
<p t="4258680" d="5820">And so what that means is that, the speech
becomes separate from the person.</p>
<p t="4264500" d="5580">And the speech is being used as a tool for
what some element of the person requires.</p>
<p t="4270080" d="5480">And that&#39;s the hiding behind convention that
Nietzsche&#39;s talking about.</p>
<p t="4275560" d="5710">Because, when people use instrumental speech,
they&#39;re almost always pursuing something that</p>
<p t="4281270" d="2720">other people have told them that they should
want.</p>
<p t="4283990" d="2440">It might be status.</p>
<p t="4286430" d="1830">It might be career promotion.</p>
<p t="4288260" d="13120">Those are two of the major, it might be material
progress of other sorts.</p>
<p t="4301380" d="6300">But the problem is that it is only part of
the person talking.</p>
<p t="4307680" d="2950">And that part, is the part that is fixated
on that local achievement.</p>
<p t="4310630" d="7070">It&#39;s not the part that is attempting to inquire
about what the truth might be in this particular</p>
<p t="4317700" d="2840">situation, and to describe it as carefully
as possible.</p>
<p t="4320540" d="3370">And that is the clearest speech of the individual.</p>
<p t="4323910" d="8190">Now one of the premises of existential psychotherapy
is that that is the only way you can be healthy.</p>
<p t="4332100" d="3810">You have to learn to speak and act as a whole.</p>
<p t="4335910" d="4370">And you have to be directed towards responsibility
and truth.</p>
<p t="4340280" d="2200">And the consequences of not doing that will
be</p>
<p t="4342480" d="7650">A. that you will suffer pointlessly which
is the worst kind of suffering and</p>
<p t="4350130" d="5060">B. which is worse, you will bring rack and
ruin onto everyone around you.</p>
<p t="4355190" d="3190">And it gets worse than that, actually, because
if you do that long enough.</p>
<p t="4358380" d="7190">Not only will you bring rack in ruin on everyone
around you, you will want to.</p>
<p t="4365570" d="5040">And that seems at least potentially like a
bad outcome.</p>
<p t="4370610" d="6140">Well, you can say, if you adopt a firm belief
system that will protect you from that.</p>
<p t="4376750" d="6620">It is like the terror management idea of ideology
protecting you from death anxiety.</p>
<p t="4383370" d="5320">Which is a, it is a very hopeless philosophy,
that.</p>
<p t="4388690" d="3871">Because it basically suggest that the only
reason people have beliefs is because they</p>
<p t="4392561" d="1639">are terrified without them.</p>
<p t="4394200" d="7540">And that if they engage in any sort of heroic
behaviour, it is merely a fa�ade, which</p>
<p t="4401740" d="3830">in the final analysis is empty, although necessary.</p>
<p t="4405570" d="3820">That is where the idea of positive illusions
came from, essentially, you know?</p>
<p t="4409390" d="3380">That life is so terrible that unless you lie
yourself into tranquility.</p>
<p t="4412770" d="4250">You will be mentally unstable and unhealthy.</p>
<p t="4417020" d="6560">A doctrine for which by the way, there is
no real evidence.</p>
<p t="4423580" d="7080">Anyways, from fear of his neighbour who insists
on convention and veils himself with it.</p>
<p t="4430660" d="3240">But what is it that compels the individual
human being to fear his neighbour.</p>
<p t="4433900" d="3680">To think and act herd fashion, and not to
be glad of himself.</p>
<p t="4437580" d="4210">A sense of shame, perhaps, in a few rare cases.</p>
<p t="4441790" d="2920">In the vast majority it is the desire for
comfort.</p>
<p t="4444710" d="4610">Inertia, in short, that inclination to laziness
of which the traveller spoke.</p>
<p t="4449320" d="1080">He is right.</p>
<p t="4450400" d="3340">Men are even lazier than they are timid.</p>
<p t="4453740" d="4110">What they fear most is the troubles with which
any unconditional honesty and nudity would</p>
<p t="4457850" d="3840">burden them.</p>
<p t="4461690" d="4670">Only artists hate this slovenly life in borrowed
