<p t="489" d="2090">When I started working on this problem</p>
<p t="3520" d="3109">Or, I guess, when when it started working on me</p>
<p t="7569" d="4609">Was probably really in the mid 80&#39;s and I found myself</p>
<p t="13900" d="5870">Suffering from two things one was a very lengthy sequence of nightmares about Nuclear destruction</p>
<p t="20770" d="3529">and they&#39;re very affecting dreams and</p>
<p t="26769" d="4220">associated with that was a sense of amazement that a</p>
<p t="32349" d="6830">dream that was that awful could reflect a reality that could be that awful</p>
<p t="39969" d="2000">and an additional</p>
<p t="42340" d="2000">amazement out the fact that, despite</p>
<p t="45730" d="5180">the production of thousands and tens and thousands of weapons of unimaginable destruction</p>
<p t="52329" d="4430">and that qualitative qualitative change in human capacity that represented</p>
<p t="57760" d="2720">That people could go about their day-to-day lives without</p>
<p t="61270" d="3229">acting as if anything fundamental whatsoever had changed</p>
<p t="65920" d="3379">Now I&#39;ve never really been able to figure out why that disturbed me so much</p>
<p t="70210" d="2000">when it seemed to not disturb</p>
<p t="72790" d="1290">to any</p>
<p t="74080" d="2000">profound degree most of the people I knew</p>
<p t="77020" d="2000">It doesn&#39;t really matter</p>
<p t="79509" d="3260">The upshot of it was that I spent...</p>
<p t="83350" d="5599">I probably spent my whole life trying to understand what evil was and, more importantly, what might be done about it</p>
<p t="91440" d="3740">it&#39;s a strange pursuit in some ways for an academic done undertake because</p>
<p t="95380" d="6300">Academics tend to talk about academic things. And one thing you can say about evil is that, whatever it is, it&#39;s not bloody well academic</p>
<p t="102960" d="3940">It&#39;s not an intellectual issue. It&#39;s an existential issue and</p>
<p t="107860" d="4099">it&#39;s it&#39;s not a theoretical issue. It&#39;s an it&#39;s an issue that deals with that</p>
<p t="113020" d="2000">absolute nature of reality and</p>
<p t="115780" d="2959">I guess sometimes I think that people who go into Academia</p>
<p t="118740" d="4260">Go into Academia to shield themselves from having to ask questions about the absolute nature of reality</p>
<p t="123880" d="2000">so</p>
<p t="126729" d="2930">Anyways, I think before you can talk about something</p>
<p t="130500" d="2520">Before you can dare to talk about something like evil</p>
<p t="133740" d="2480">You should do some thinking about what it is that you&#39;re talking about</p>
<p t="137320" d="4140">Definitionally speaking. I learned this I believe from</p>
<p t="142630" d="2000">a historian named Jeffrey Burton Russell</p>
<p t="144660" d="5180">Who wrote a very detailed history of the idea of the Devil in the 1980s when,</p>
<p t="150340" d="4100">such histories were strange, to say the least, he was very interested</p>
<p t="154640" d="3980">in the history of the embodiment of ideas of evil and</p>
<p t="158620" d="3000">One of the things his work did for me was to help me</p>
<p t="161760" d="3100">clarify the distinction between two terrible things</p>
<p t="165280" d="5040">The distinction that has to be made and that&#39;s the distinction between tragedy and evil</p>
<p t="170360" d="4720">and I don&#39;t think you can talk about it evil at all until you distinguish it from tragedy and</p>
<p t="175380" d="6520">so I&#39;m going to try to distinguish evil from tragedy by making some reference to the essential existential condition of human beings</p>
<p t="182580" d="4720">I would say that the nature of the human being is such that it consists of</p>
<p t="187300" d="4000">a confrontation with the bounded finite with the unbounded infinite,</p>
<p t="191300" d="4610">and that those are the bare facts of the matter and the facts are that</p>
<p t="196040" d="2920">The world of experience as it presents</p>
<p t="199160" d="1260">itself to us</p>
<p t="200580" d="2400">is literally and not metaphorically</p>
<p t="203200" d="3320">complex beyond our capacity to understand</p>
<p t="206600" d="4200">and that means  that people deal in a real sense on an ongoing</p>
<p t="210800" d="7840">basis with the infinite and I believe that that fact is the reason why religious experience is essentially...</p>
<p t="219120" d="3520">And belief is essentially endemic to mankind, it&#39;s a human universal</p>
<p t="222720" d="3120">and it&#39;s not because people believe, it&#39;s because</p>
<p t="226240" d="4360">human existence as such consists of a confrontation between the finite and the infinite</p>
<p t="230920" d="2200">and religious systems merely take that into account</p>
<p t="234920" d="3720">Now our finitude in the face of the infinite has some inevitable consequences</p>
<p t="239120" d="2080">and I would say those consequences</p>
<p t="241280" d="5160">are essentially the existential conditions of life. The first of those consequences is that</p>
<p t="246720" d="7520">the finite is always overwhelmed by the infinite, it has to be because it can&#39;t encapsulate it and so what that means is that it&#39;s</p>
<p t="254400" d="3120">that suffering is central to the nature of human existence</p>
<p t="257880" d="5200">and suffering exists as a consequence of the consequences of our limitations</p>
<p t="263740" d="2860">I mean every single person who&#39;s alive is going to die</p>
<p t="267040" d="5840">And every single person who&#39;s alive is going to deal with serious physical illness and mental distress</p>
<p t="273080" d="4580">If they don&#39;t suffer, if they aren&#39;t suffering it directly, immediately, right now on their own</p>
<p t="277860" d="3600">It&#39;s almost inevitably the case that every single person who walks the Earth</p>
<p t="281680" d="6560">is confronting the bare bones of reality at that level in the guise of an afflicted family member</p>
<p t="288760" d="3640">And so the fact of our finitude is again, no academic issue.</p>
<p t="293280" d="5460">It&#39;s essential to the nature of our being and we&#39;re forced to deal with it on an ongoing basis</p>
<p t="298960" d="6000">So I would say insufficiency is built into human experience and there are existential consequences to that</p>
<p t="306360" d="5240">Now I read something a long time ago, and I don&#39;t remember who wrote it, but it was written about</p>
<p t="313260" d="2520">Jewish commentary on the Torah</p>
<p t="316840" d="1860">God is omniscient</p>
<p t="318700" d="2300">omnipotent and omnipresent</p>
<p t="321480" d="2000">What does he lack?</p>
<p t="324220" d="1220">And the answer is limitation</p>
<p t="326020" d="3540">And that&#39;s a riddle and an answer of unparalleled brilliance</p>
<p t="329700" d="2000">as far as I&#39;m concerned, because I think it speaks</p>
<p t="332100" d="3660">Deeply to something about the central nature of existence itself and that is that</p>
<p t="336550" d="2000">without limitation, there&#39;s no being</p>
<p t="339160" d="1910">Now that&#39;s a hard thing to understand</p>
<p t="341070" d="2750">But I think you can understand it in a number of different ways</p>
<p t="343820" d="2220">the first thing you might want to understand is that...</p>
<p t="347760" d="2340">I play this game with my students sometimes in my class</p>
<p t="350100" d="3760">I&#39;ll come up to a student, I pick a poor victim at random and come up to them</p>
<p t="354000" d="2000">and say: Okay, we&#39;re going to play a game</p>
<p t="356800" d="2360">And they say: ok. And I say: well you move first</p>
<p t="359710" d="6380">well, they don&#39;t know what to do and the reason for that is because the limiting parameters of the game have not been defined</p>
<p t="366090" d="4410">And, as a consequence of that, they&#39;re stunned by their infinite freedom into complete immobility</p>
<p t="370690" d="5660">and what that means in a sense is that in the absence of serious constraint there can be no choice</p>
<p t="376350" d="3430">no freedom, no existence. And I believe this to be</p>
<p t="380120" d="5640">fundamentally true, just as the fact that human being is vulnerable is fundamentally true</p>
<p t="386520" d="3300">Here&#39;s another example that I think is more personal to me</p>
<p t="390120" d="4420">and it emerged in my imagination as a consequence of my contemplation of my son&#39;s</p>
<p t="394760" d="4660">vulnerability. So I have children. They´re teenagers now. I still like them</p>
<p t="401539" d="4759">One of the things I was really struck by when my children were little was how perfect</p>
<p t="406299" d="2790">they were like and I believe that that was the</p>
<p t="410360" d="3109">Benevolence of God in a sense -  children are tremendously difficult</p>
<p t="413469" d="5691">they&#39;re a tremendous responsibility - but they&#39;re so perfect and they manifest that perfection in such a</p>
<p t="419360" d="6960">remarkable way that that&#39;s the payment for taking on the responsibility of bringing them into being and caring for them and</p>
<p t="426760" d="3740">The thing about being a parent is that the vulnerability of people</p>
<p t="430720" d="5280">may manifest to you in a way that was never the case prior to that and</p>
<p t="436009" d="6049">It&#39;s not it&#39;s haunting and it&#39;s beautiful, but it&#39;s also exactly right in a way, and I was thinking well look at my son</p>
<p t="442059" d="600">He&#39;s a little kid</p>
<p t="442660" d="3700">You know you got to chase after him all the time you can get sick people hurt him</p>
<p t="446500" d="3420">you know, people are going to be mean to him. He&#39;s going to be disappointed in his life</p>
<p t="450220" d="6160">He&#39;s vulnerable, and it&#39;s a constant tragic reality that he&#39;s vulnerable. And I thought well, okay</p>
<p t="456399" d="5279">Let&#39;s say we want to do something about that, so let&#39;s say we make him so that no one can pick on him</p>
<p t="461679" d="3149">so it could inflate him to about 20 feet high and equip him with a</p>
<p t="465439" d="1111">metallic</p>
<p t="466550" d="5089">skeleton and a cast-iron exoskeleton, and you could equip him with a</p>
<p t="472189" d="6110">computerized intelligence that far supersedes his own, and you could remove his vulnerabilities one by one hypothetically</p>
<p t="478300" d="1239">and of course more and more</p>
<p t="479539" d="4279">We&#39;re in a position where we could do that in reality. And one of the things I realized right away was that</p>
<p t="484369" d="3079">as you remove the vulnerabilities you remove the thing you love</p>
<p t="488360" d="6520">And then I started to understand more deeply that vulnerability was a precondition for human being and that was a desirable</p>
<p t="495200" d="4620">precondition because the things about human existence that are wonderful and</p>
<p t="500000" d="2600">remarkable are so integrally tied up with</p>
<p t="503000" d="2420">vulnerability that they&#39;re actually inextricable</p>
<p t="507460" d="2000">The Jewish commentary</p>
<p t="509839" d="1320">what the</p>
<p t="511160" d="2000">Infinite lacks is the finite</p>
<p t="513800" d="2740">There&#39;s a more abstract way of getting at the same thing</p>
<p t="517420" d="3080">If you could do absolutely anything you wanted at any point</p>
<p t="520620" d="5220">and be anywhere you wanted, be anything you wanted and if there was nothing that was out of your reach</p>
<p t="525980" d="5280">there would be nothing to do because you&#39;d be everything at once and when you&#39;re everything at once,</p>
<p t="531440" d="3000">which is at least in principle the position of God,</p>
<p t="534740" d="5869">There&#39;s no story and there&#39;s no being and there&#39;s something about being that is a story. And without limitation</p>
<p t="540610" d="7289">there&#39;s no story. So then the question starts to become, with regards to consideration of human vulnerability. Is there a way to conduct your life</p>
<p t="548450" d="4489">In such a manner that the intrinsic vulnerability that characterizes your life</p>
<p t="554060" d="6619">is rendered, not only acceptable but desirable. And to me that&#39;s the central question of existence. And I tell you, get that wrong</p>
<p t="560720" d="5179">and you&#39;re on the wrong track and if you&#39;re on the wrong track, man, you are in one terrible place</p>
<p t="567740" d="5060">I would say, with regards to tragedy, humans are vulnerable and that&#39;s tragic</p>
<p t="572960" d="5840">But if tragedy is the price that we pay for existence then so be it if existence is justifiable</p>
<p t="578800" d="5699">And so tragedy itself, which is merely a revelation of our vulnerability, can&#39;t be regarded as evil</p>
<p t="585080" d="3180">it&#39;s just a... it&#39;s a condition of existence</p>
<p t="588600" d="5980">And so it&#39;s necessary to distinguish the tragic conditions of existence from evil before you can even address the problem</p>
<p t="594580" d="3520">And I think what that means to some degree is you should not blame on the</p>
<p t="598440" d="2700">relationship between the finite and the infinite</p>
<p t="601820" d="5360">the terrible failings of humanity that can be laid directly at the feet of human beings</p>
<p t="607480" d="3380">So earthquakes aren&#39;t evil and cancer isn&#39;t evil and</p>
<p t="611360" d="5440">Mental illness isn&#39;t evil and predators aren&#39;t evil. They just are part of the way things are</p>
<p t="617480" d="2800">But there are certain categories of human action that are</p>
<p t="620480" d="6120">definitely outside the parameters of mere tragedy. And those are the things we really have to get a handle on</p>
<p t="627820" d="7080">Evil for me is differentiated from tragedy by its lack of necessity and it&#39;s volunteerism</p>
<p t="635540" d="600">and</p>
<p t="636580" d="4980">It&#39;s a tenant, I think, of modern materialistic thought that</p>
<p t="642160" d="5260">there are social or material causes for actions and it&#39;s an extraordinarily useful theory</p>
<p t="648140" d="3120">And I think... but I think one of the unfortunate consequences of that</p>
<p t="651280" d="4200">is that we&#39;ve tended to write off much of human misbehavior and attribute it to, say</p>
<p t="655790" d="1610">insufficiencies and material conditions</p>
<p t="657400" d="6750">which is not an it&#39;s not an acceptable theory. There are all sorts of human cultures that were characterized by</p>
<p t="665240" d="2120">virtually complete absence of material</p>
<p t="667780" d="1660">Luxury, well-being</p>
<p t="669440" d="4280">Whose cultures were highly functional and and highly moral</p>
<p t="674210" d="4760">And to describe the propensity towards misbehavior as a consequence of economic inequality</p>
<p t="679520" d="2270">Is entirely beside the point as far as I&#39;m concerned</p>
<p t="684020" d="2330">Evil is more pernicious than that</p>
<p t="687440" d="5030">Which is generated for example by social inequality. I think it&#39;s actually, although</p>
<p t="692470" d="4769">this is a terrifying thought in some ways, it&#39;s more appropriate to consider it a form of</p>
<p t="698930" d="2000">demonically</p>
<p t="701330" d="1200">warped</p>
<p t="702530" d="4070">aesthetic. And I&#39;ll give you a couple of examples of what I mean by that for example</p>
<p t="707690" d="5390">Because the manifestation of this warped aesthetic makes itself</p>
<p t="713600" d="2389">apparent under certain conditions, so for example</p>
<p t="715990" d="5790">I think it made itself apparent in the imagination of the first politician who coined the acronym</p>
<p t="722810" d="2000">MAD or Mutual Assured Destruction</p>
<p t="726470" d="3440">That&#39;s an aesthetic of Evil, to make a joke</p>
<p t="730670" d="2059">of a situation that catastrophic</p>
<p t="733520" d="6020">indicates the kind of malevolence that lurks behind the fact that such a condition exists</p>
<p t="739580" d="4000">The motto on the gates of Auschwitz, I believe,</p>
<p t="744290" d="2000">in the second world war</p>
<p t="746480" d="2000">Work will make you free</p>
<p t="748850" d="4190">That&#39;s another manifestation of the aesthetic of evil. It&#39;s a terrible terrible</p>
<p t="753980" d="2000">ironic joke and</p>
<p t="755990" d="5270">It&#39;s instructive to meditate on what sort of imagination would have the arrogance to</p>
<p t="762980" d="2000">tell such a terrible joke</p>
<p t="766850" d="3049">The concentration Camps are classic examples of evil</p>
<p t="769900" d="4409">And I think by analyzing at least certain kinds of events that occurred within them</p>
<p t="774310" d="4650">It&#39;s easier to get a clear idea of what evil constitutes. And one of the stories that&#39;s always</p>
<p t="779510" d="3590">haunting me, I guess, is - I believe it&#39;s another story derived from Auschwitz -</p>
<p t="783710" d="5869">The prison guards in Auschwitz would take the prisoners who were already stripped of their dignity, and to whatever degree</p>
<p t="789740" d="6820">possible, their identity and their culture and their language and their status as valuable beings. And yet that wasn&#39;t sufficient</p>
<p t="796820" d="6320">they needed to be tortured in addition to that before they were killed and the torture often consisted of a</p>
<p t="803960" d="2000">self-evidently counterproductive work</p>
<p t="807230" d="7849">A situation that also frequently characterized activity in the soviet gulag archipelago where perhaps 60 million people met their death</p>
<p t="817280" d="7760">A typical Auschwitz example was the requirement for prisoners to carry 100-pound sacks of wet salt from one side of the compound and then back again</p>
<p t="825470" d="2089">Now that&#39;s evil as far as I&#39;m concerned</p>
<p t="827560" d="6040">and you have to think about it from an aesthetic perspective in a sense because it&#39;s a celebration of horror</p>
<p t="834000" d="8320">And it&#39;s a conscious attempt to violate the conditions that make life itself tolerable, and it&#39;s aimed at</p>
<p t="843560" d="1230">dehumanization</p>
<p t="844790" d="2000">destruction of the ideal</p>
<p t="847010" d="2000">And at an even deeper level,</p>
<p t="849340" d="2760">revenge against the conditions of existence itself</p>
<p t="852680" d="5320">I&#39;ve tried to understand the developmental pathway that leads to acts like that</p>
<p t="861520" d="3920">My academic research as well as my clinical experience</p>
<p t="865840" d="2000">Has revealed to me that</p>
<p t="868300" d="6660">What appears to lie at the bottom of motivation for the excesses of behavior that characterize evil</p>
<p t="875300" d="3660">are too tightly causally related factors</p>
<p t="880340" d="3380">one, arrogance and another resentment</p>
<p t="884760" d="3060">And both of those are tied up with</p>
<p t="890660" d="5680">vulnerability of human beings in the face of the infinite but</p>
<p t="898340" d="2000">but tied up with something more</p>
<p t="900620" d="2000">profound as well</p>
<p t="902750" d="4850">The most thorough account of this that I&#39;ve managed, I think, at least to partially comprehend</p>
<p t="907600" d="4600">I believe is contained in the first couple of the stories in the old testament</p>
<p t="913000" d="1300">In Genesis</p>
<p t="914740" d="6080">The story of Adam and Eve and the fall of man. And the immediately following story of Cain and Abel</p>
<p t="921920" d="7220">As far as we can tell those are very very old stories. They predate judaism at least in some of their</p>
<p t="930040" d="2220">in some of their structural elements</p>
<p t="932540" d="5420">It&#39;s conceivable that some of the and those stories are as old as the human capacity to tell stories itself</p>
<p t="938570" d="4399">Assuming that they were grounded in an oral tradition that predated the written tradition</p>
<p t="942970" d="4830">and we know that oral traditions can last at least in some forms unchanged for periods of up to</p>
<p t="948320" d="4849">25,000 years, so the anthropological and archaeological evidence is fairly clear on that point</p>
<p t="953900" d="2630">these are very very very old stories</p>
<p t="957080" d="3740">And people remember them and created them for reasons we really don&#39;t understand</p>
<p t="960980" d="4960">And they&#39;re strange and mysterious and unforgettable all at the same time</p>
<p t="966860" d="6160">The story of Adam and Eve, as far as I can tell, is the story of the coming of consciousness</p>
<p t="973140" d="2760">The coming of self-consciousness to Mankind</p>
<p t="976640" d="3920">And, I think that the human</p>
<p t="983060" d="4460">The human self-consciousness is what separates us from animals</p>
<p t="988300" d="2240">In Genesis there&#39;s an insistence that</p>
<p t="990650" d="5869">When Adam ate the apple that eve offered to him the scales fell from his eyes and the first thing that he realized was that</p>
<p t="996520" d="1060">He was naked</p>
<p t="997580" d="2929">And what that seems to me to mean is that, I mean...</p>
<p t="1000510" d="3030">I think it means first of all that women make men self-conscious</p>
<p t="1003540" d="4739">And I think there&#39;s ample reason to presume not and there&#39;s good evolutionary reasons for suggesting</p>
<p t="1008280" d="2940">why that might be the case. Because sexual selection among</p>
<p t="1011500" d="5329">human beings has been a primary force of evolutionary development and sexual selection in human beings</p>
<p t="1017710" d="1200">is primarily</p>
<p t="1018910" d="4130">conducted by women. So, for example, as Roy has pointed out in</p>
<p t="1024070" d="2089">his address to the APA a few years ago,</p>
<p t="1026160" d="6329">and I hope I get this right, twice as many of your relatives where women as men. And that means that women</p>
<p t="1032800" d="5179">are more frequently reproductive successful than men and that they reject most men</p>
<p t="1038530" d="6619">And the rejection of a man for reproductive purposes by a woman is the most serious form of rejection that&#39;s possible from an evolutionary</p>
<p t="1045220" d="1950">point of view because the judgment is that</p>
<p t="1047170" d="5650">Well you might be nice enough to talk to but you&#39;re sure not fit to have your genes propagate into the next generation</p>
<p t="1053200" d="3800">So it&#39;s no wonder that women can make men self-conscious</p>
<p t="1057000" d="5310">And I think there&#39;s some reason to presume that it&#39;s the sexual selection forces that women placed upon man</p>
<p t="1062310" d="4859">That drove rapid human cortical evolution and the development of self-consciousness. Now that&#39;s a leap</p>
<p t="1067170" d="3150">And there&#39;s no way I can justify that in the course of this particular</p>
<p t="1070840" d="3440">talk but I think there is good reason to presume that it&#39;s the case</p>
<p t="1074900" d="6180">In Genesis human beings become self-conscious and the first thing that happens to them is that they realize they&#39;re naked and then the next thing</p>
<p t="1081090" d="3780">that happens to them is they develop the moral sense to tell the difference between good and evil</p>
<p t="1084870" d="4380">And it&#39;s a very strange thing because in some sense before a creature is self conscious</p>
<p t="1089250" d="4650">there is no distinction between good and evil because as I said before a predator is not evil</p>
<p t="1093900" d="5160">It&#39;s just a predator. The fact of a predator like a wolf might be a tragedy for the rabbit</p>
<p t="1099060" d="3689">But you can&#39;t be assuming that the wolf is evil merely because it wants to eat the rabbit</p>
<p t="1102749" d="4531">but with the dawning of self-consciousness there seems to be</p>
<p t="1107500" d="5840">the emergence of a moral sense that&#39;s essentially unique to human beings and that has something to do with our</p>
<p t="1113440" d="5269">capacity to reflect upon the mechanisms of our action and then, for some reason, to be able to</p>
<p t="1118780" d="4219">modify those actions and to choose which ones to implement into the future, in the future</p>
<p t="1123000" d="6180">We don&#39;t understand that and you can even deny if you&#39;d like that the phenomena of free choice exists</p>
<p t="1129180" d="1570">But our culture is essentially</p>
<p t="1130750" d="5420">predicated on the notion that it does exist and in the absence of evidence that it doesn&#39;t I&#39;m going to take the easy way out</p>
<p t="1136170" d="1900">and assume that it does</p>
<p t="1138070" d="2599">Otherwise things fall apart and they fall apart badly</p>
<p t="1142210" d="1770">When...</p>
<p t="1143980" d="6170">After Adam and Eve becomes self conscious the first thing they do is close themselves. And to me that&#39;s a mythological</p>
<p t="1150520" d="2800">description of the emergence of culture as an</p>
<p t="1153660" d="2520">intersession between the fundamental</p>
<p t="1156420" d="5680">vulnerability and nakedness of the human form and the depredations of nature. If you realize that you&#39;re vulnerable</p>
<p t="1162240" d="5580">and prone to death the first thing you&#39;re going to do is to start rearranging the manner in which you construe yourself</p>
<p t="1167820" d="2909">So that you can protect yourself from such an unfortunate outcome</p>
<p t="1171190" d="2689">that&#39;s, I think, partly why God curses Adam with the</p>
<p t="1173950" d="5390">necessity of work once he finds out, once God finds out that people have become self conscious. Like if you know that</p>
<p t="1179560" d="5000">that winter is lurking in the future, for example, you&#39;re going to work and animals don&#39;t work</p>
<p t="1184560" d="1800">they&#39;re just motivated to do whatever they do</p>
<p t="1186360" d="3180">But humans work and that means they subvert their day to day</p>
<p t="1189580" d="6680">motivations, their immediate motivations for the purposes of future security and there&#39;s a real cost to that</p>
<p t="1196260" d="8060">I mean, part of the cost is separation from the pure and unadulterated flow of animal life, and I believe that people suffer from that</p>
<p t="1204840" d="2120">absence of flow</p>
<p t="1207800" d="2140">continually and</p>
<p t="1209940" d="2059">the advantage they gain from it</p>
<p t="1212000" d="6940">Is that they can plan for the future, but the disadvantage is that they&#39;re calculative and cold and separated from their own instinctual resources</p>
<p t="1221180" d="7220">Eve, of course, is cursed by what&#39;s going to be terrible pain in childbirth, and that&#39;s related to the development of</p>
<p t="1229050" d="5659">the Immense skull size that characterizes human infants and their incredibly lengthy period of</p>
<p t="1235950" d="3139">dependence which is also associated with their immense brain</p>
<p t="1241170" d="3709">After Adam and eve become self-conscious they hide</p>
<p t="1245790" d="2150">And this is actually a comical part of genesis</p>
<p t="1247940" d="4739">it&#39;s never really read as a comedy, but it is a comedy even the fall itself is a comedy and...</p>
<p t="1253200" d="2389">so they&#39;re hiding away behind a bush</p>
<p t="1256410" d="6410">and God comes walking through the garden and God, the infinite, is accustomed to walking with Adam, with no</p>
<p t="1263940" d="2260">interruption of the flow of information between them</p>
<p t="1267120" d="2400">But Adam is in error and God says you know</p>
<p t="1270560" d="2260">Where where have you gone and Adam says: Oh well</p>
<p t="1272840" d="6030">I&#39;m hiding. And God says, which is kind of stupid really and this is why it&#39;s a comics, like he&#39;s hiding behind a bush</p>
<p t="1279060" d="4640">This is God, and he can see through bushes and like Adam should know that. But It doesn&#39;t really matter</p>
<p t="1283700" d="5459">He&#39;s hiding me on this bush anyways and God... So Adam says I&#39;m hiding and and God says: Well</p>
<p t="1289160" d="3780">well why are you hiding? Well it&#39;s because Adam is ashamed and...</p>
<p t="1293910" d="2599">Adam says: Well, I&#39;m naked</p>
<p t="1297630" d="2000">And this is an example of the tremendous</p>
<p t="1300150" d="5239">compression of Human wisdom into a few lines that characterizes mythology. You could say: Well, why would people hide from God</p>
<p t="1306000" d="5359">once they realize they&#39;re naked? And I would say well, that&#39;s pretty obvious, like, once you know you&#39;re vulnerable.</p>
<p t="1311580" d="4729">Or do you really have enough courage to manifest any sort of semblance of a divine destiny?</p>
<p t="1316830" d="2329">Well, the answer to that is pretty much, clearly no</p>
<p t="1319160" d="5699">And it&#39;s no bloody wonder. And so the hiding is... People hide when they&#39;re self-conscious and vulnerable. And what are they hiding from then?</p>
<p t="1324860" d="5400">They&#39;re hiding from their deepest destiny and it&#39;s no wonder. God says: Okay, yeah, well you figured that out</p>
<p t="1330260" d="4979">and how that happened. And Adam says, and this is comical too, It was the woman&#39;s fault. Which I think is really funny and</p>
<p t="1335420" d="4920">which actually may have been the original sin and not the eating of the apple, right? The first time that</p>
<p t="1340470" d="5000">the man blamed the woman for his self-conscious misery</p>
<p t="1345470" d="3510">I think that&#39;s the real fall and not the rise of self-consciousness itself</p>
<p t="1349800" d="3650">Anyways, we know the rest of the story. God says: Oh, well the cats out of the bag now.</p>
<p t="1353450" d="6059">You know you&#39;re vulnerable and from here on in history starts. Your out of paradise, you&#39;re out of unconscious</p>
<p t="1359880" d="5930">identification with the natural world. You&#39;re going to work, you&#39;re going to sweat lots of the time it isn&#39;t going to work and</p>
<p t="1366300" d="4250">Women, they&#39;re going to be beholden to their husbands not because that&#39;s divine</p>
<p t="1371160" d="2390">fiat, but because the developmental...</p>
<p t="1374310" d="6890">The developmental dependency of a human infant is so extreme that women are cursed to rely on men for protection</p>
<p t="1381200" d="2000">when they&#39;re at their most vulnerable</p>
<p t="1383490" d="5570">Fine. So that&#39;s self-consciousness and an explanation for why people would hide away from their destiny</p>
<p t="1389060" d="2549">But then the next story, the Cain and Abel story really</p>
<p t="1392280" d="5390">elaborates that out and describes it. And so Cain and Abel, of course, are two sons of Adam and Eve</p>
<p t="1397670" d="1990">And they&#39;re really the first people</p>
<p t="1399660" d="2150">Because, of course Adam and Eve were made by God</p>
<p t="1401850" d="5479">so they&#39;re really not people at all because people are born. And Cain and Abel are the first two people</p>
<p t="1407910" d="2390">And they characterized, as far as I can tell,</p>
<p t="1410880" d="9880">to canonical patterns of reaction, to the terrible vulnerability that&#39;s revealed as a consequence of the development of self-consciousness</p>
<p t="1421380" d="2220">Cain and Abel make sacrifices to God</p>
<p t="1424500" d="1500">Why?</p>
<p t="1426000" d="4970">Human cultures make sacrifices. That&#39;s what they do, sacrifice, sacrificial rituals is human universal</p>
<p t="1432300" d="2000">blood sacrifices is human universal</p>
<p t="1434640" d="2359">human sacrifice, at least in some</p>
<p t="1437460" d="6409">anthropological epochs was regarded as a human universal. Why do people make sacrifices to God to please them?</p>
<p t="1444390" d="2060">It seems like a mystery to modern people</p>
<p t="1446960" d="3800">I ask my students. What sacrifices did you make to go to university?</p>
<p t="1451240" d="920">Well, they can answer that in</p>
<p t="1452160" d="5510">2/10 of a second. You know they can&#39;t party as much as they might have they can&#39;t drink nearly as much beer as they might</p>
<p t="1457670" d="5130">have liked to. More seriously, a lot of them work, a lot of them have put their families in</p>
<p t="1463800" d="4880">serious financial straits to send them to university. They&#39;ve given up all sorts of things</p>
<p t="1468890" d="6449">In order to pursue a course of action that they believe will best ensure their harmonious relationship with the nature of reality?</p>
<p t="1475769" d="6620">Everyone makes sacrifices. Ok, we can say that now because we&#39;re psychologically sophisticated and linguistically sophisticated</p>
<p t="1482390" d="1750">We know something about human psychology</p>
<p t="1484140" d="5149">But thousands and thousands of years ago, before people had this explicit psychological acumen, the best</p>
<p t="1489289" d="5811">they could do is act out and tell stories about human psychology because they hadn&#39;t developed any further than that</p>
<p t="1495280" d="2220">And Cain and Abel is one of those stories</p>
<p t="1498840" d="2630">The Sacrifices are burnt on an altar</p>
<p t="1501470" d="2849">Why? Well a smoke rises. Well,</p>
<p t="1504320" d="4500">so what? Well God&#39;s up in the sky and if the smoke rises up there, and he gets a whiff of it</p>
<p t="1508820" d="3569">He can tell what the quality of the sacrifice was and you can laugh about that</p>
<p t="1512389" d="2790">And you can think it. You can think about it as primitive</p>
<p t="1515179" d="2550">But it&#39;s not primitive, its artistic and it&#39;s beautiful in it</p>
<p t="1517730" d="2219">And it&#39;s accurate. And here&#39;s why, is because</p>
<p t="1520400" d="5840">before the invention of the electrical light and maybe before the invention of fire and...</p>
<p t="1527480" d="6600">The closest a human being could ever get to direct confrontation with the absolute unknown was to look up at the night sky</p>
<p t="1534200" d="3200">Because the night sky, especially when it&#39;s sprinkled with stars</p>
<p t="1537480" d="4020">confronts you directly with the fact of the infinite. And to make the presupposition</p>
<p t="1541600" d="4000">that God resides in the infinite, and you&#39;re having a direct experience</p>
<p t="1545600" d="4200">of the infinite at that moment, is not a primitive notion it&#39;s a very</p>
<p t="1550160" d="2660">intelligent and and creative hypothesis</p>
<p t="1552880" d="5860">And so, the notion that god occupies the sky, the day sky being equally as impressive as the night sky, is not a primitive</p>
<p t="1559110" d="6949">hypothesis, it&#39;s a reflection of the nature of a certain kind of human experience. You burn something and you send the smoke up</p>
<p t="1566060" d="2720">God gets a crack at determining the quality</p>
<p t="1568860" d="2820">of your offering, the quality of your sacrifice</p>
<p t="1571680" d="3240">Well, let&#39;s be perfectly clear about this</p>
<p t="1575040" d="5800">If your sacrifices aren&#39;t first-rate the nature of your relationship with the infinite is going to suffer dreadfully</p>
<p t="1580960" d="3120">And that&#39;s exactly what the story of Cain and Abel reveals.</p>
<p t="1584639" d="1111">Now, Abel</p>
<p t="1585750" d="6019">He&#39;s a trusting character. He believes in the nature of experience, in the nature of existence. When he&#39;s called on to make a sacrifice</p>
<p t="1591769" d="7080">he sacrifices the best that he has to offer and that makes God happy and as a consequence everything that abel touches turns to gold</p>
<p t="1599000" d="4620">Everyone likes him, they respect him. His crops multiply, he&#39;s successful with women</p>
<p t="1603700" d="7240">Plus he&#39;s a wonderful guy, so you could hardly imagine a more annoying creature if you possibly attempted to do it</p>
<p t="1610940" d="5250">Whereas Cain has reacted to his self-consciousness by withdrawing from the infinite</p>
<p t="1616190" d="5250">And there&#39;s a tremendous danger in that because it starts to mean that he relies purely on his own</p>
<p t="1622020" d="2000">devious devices to</p>
<p t="1624680" d="2500">Sale his ship through the shores of life</p>
<p t="1628340" d="5700">He believes, as his arrogance develops, as a consequence of this withdrawal from the infinite</p>
<p t="1634350" d="6890">A contact that he can&#39;t tolerate because he can&#39;t tolerate his own vulnerability, that he is able to deceive the structure of reality itself to offer</p>
<p t="1641490" d="3530">second-rate sacrifices to God himself, who can see</p>
<p t="1645300" d="4759">absolutely everything because the infinite is absolutely everything and to prevail nonetheless</p>
<p t="1650340" d="2810">Well, needless to say this does not work</p>
<p t="1653150" d="6539">And it doesn&#39;t work in an obvious way if you talk to people and they reveal to you their</p>
<p t="1660059" d="4670">unnecessary suffering it&#39;s very straightforward to look behind what it is that they have to say</p>
<p t="1665490" d="2239">They&#39;ll tell you the poor decisions they made</p>
<p t="1667730" d="4109">in their lives and the opportunities that they didn&#39;t take and the chances that they didn&#39;t</p>
<p t="1672300" d="5689">they didn&#39;t have enough courage to grasp and the sacrifices they fail to make. There&#39;s nothing mysterious about it</p>
<p t="1678540" d="5809">And their own experiences teach them full well that they pathologized the relationship they have with the nature of reality</p>
<p t="1685290" d="3079">Well, that&#39;s a terrible thing. Well, and Cain is dreadfully unhappy</p>
<p t="1688800" d="2689">He&#39;s unhappy because nothing he ever wants happens</p>
<p t="1691489" d="4751">And that&#39;s partly because he doesn&#39;t really want it because if he really wanted he&#39;d make the right sacrifices</p>
<p t="1696340" d="5220">And the salt is rubbed into his wounds by the existence of his brother, for whom everything seems simple</p>
<p t="1701570" d="3060">But of course really isn&#39;t. Cain goes to complain to God</p>
<p t="1705780" d="4909">And I had to read three or four different translations of these particular verses to figure out what this meant</p>
<p t="1711390" d="2000">And he says</p>
<p t="1713610" d="3770">What in the world is going on here? I&#39;m working myself to the bone</p>
<p t="1717380" d="3030">I&#39;m sacrificing things left right and center. Everything</p>
<p t="1720410" d="5519">I touch turns to dirt, everything turns against me. Like, what&#39;s up with the nature of reality?</p>
<p t="1726620" d="3040">Cain&#39;s essential vulnerability is revealed</p>
<p t="1730060" d="6320">And exacerbated by his pathological attitude towards his own actions. God says to him, essentially</p>
<p t="1737280" d="2000">Sin is a predatory cat that</p>
<p t="1740000" d="2720">crouches at your doorway and leaps on you at will</p>
<p t="1742720" d="2640">But if you only wanted to, you could master it.</p>
<p t="1745400" d="2000">And that is absolutely</p>
<p t="1747540" d="5800">the last thing that Cain wants to hear because if things are going from bad to worse for you</p>
<p t="1753350" d="2340">and you&#39;re playing a causal role in it</p>
<p t="1755760" d="4140">There&#39;s nothing more horrible that someone can do you</p>
<p t="1760220" d="5280">But reveal to you in a way that you can&#39;t deny, that you&#39;re entirely complicit in your own demise</p>
<p t="1765760" d="4420">And that&#39;s exactly what God does to Cain. And so, what does Cain do?</p>
<p t="1771000" d="5300">Well the logical thing would be listen because if the structure of reality itself tells you something</p>
<p t="1776300" d="7380">It&#39;s best to listen since there&#39;s no way out of it. But that&#39;s not what Cain does. He&#39;s so incensed by his essential vulnerability,</p>
<p t="1784220" d="5300">compromised and exacerbated by his failure to make the appropriate sacrifices and to conduct himself appropriately</p>
<p t="1789600" d="6360">that he decides, then and there, number one, to destroy his ideal, to reduce the tension that he feels</p>
<p t="1796080" d="6709">when that ideal exists as a contrast point and number two, to destroy the favorite son of God. And so he goes out into the field</p>
<p t="1802790" d="5339">and kills Abel. And God comes along and says: Where&#39;s my favorite son? And Cain says:</p>
<p t="1808800" d="1700">I killed him</p>
<p t="1810720" d="6640">And it&#39;s so interesting to me that that story is placed... Really, it&#39;s the third story in the old testament</p>
<p t="1817370" d="1920">It&#39;s it&#39;s with the archaic stories</p>
<p t="1819290" d="5450">And it&#39;s a story that reveals, as far as I can tell, that there are two essential patterns of reaction to the</p>
<p t="1824960" d="4060">self-conscious vulnerable conditions of existence. And one is</p>
<p t="1829340" d="840">humble</p>
<p t="1830600" d="5320">approach to infinity with determined attempts to make the appropriate sacrifices</p>
<p t="1835980" d="4040">The other is arrogance, resentment, the keeping of everything good for oneself</p>
<p t="1840020" d="4580">and the degeneration of the soul into something that&#39;s homicidally murderous</p>
<p t="1844980" d="3800">Well the story doesn&#39;t stop there. It gets really compressed in this part</p>
<p t="1848780" d="4890">And that&#39;s perhaps because some of its being lost with the passages of time. But the next thing that happens is that</p>
<p t="1854760" d="2000">Well, God doesn&#39;t punish Cain</p>
<p t="1857340" d="1980">And you think</p>
<p t="1859320" d="4279">That&#39;s kind of strange. I mean, in the whole old testament, God, he&#39;s punishing people left right and center</p>
<p t="1863600" d="2430">Why not Cain? And you think, well</p>
<p t="1866160" d="4539">He marks Cain, and he says to the people who are around that they should leave him alone</p>
<p t="1871220" d="3739">Because he&#39;s been marked by God as to be left alone. And the reason for that I think</p>
<p t="1874960" d="3450">And this is something that&#39;s reflected in our legal system, is that</p>
<p t="1878920" d="2000">Murder promotes revenge</p>
<p t="1881480" d="6780">And revenge destroys societies. And so God puts an end to the situation, right there and then, by telling people</p>
<p t="1888440" d="2620">that, despite the fact that Cain has</p>
<p t="1892820" d="4560">has committed a terrible crime that there will be no retribution</p>
<p t="1899000" d="6140">Cain goes off and gets married and he has a number of generations of offspring</p>
<p t="1907620" d="4240">If you insult a member of the first generation of Cain&#39;s offspring</p>
<p t="1912420" d="2300">he doesn&#39;t kill you, it kills seven of you</p>
<p t="1915200" d="3740">And if you insult a member of the second generation of Cain&#39;s offspring</p>
<p t="1919190" d="3649">he doesn&#39;t kill seven of you, he kills seven times seven of you</p>
<p t="1923510" d="6560">And then on down the road of the offspring of Cain is Tubal Cain</p>
<p t="1930830" d="1950">And Tubal Cain is the</p>
<p t="1932780" d="2209">artificer of weapons of War and</p>
<p t="1935780" d="1140">this</p>
<p t="1936920" d="7729">Stunningly Brilliant story says in it&#39;s incredibly compressed fashion that the motivation that drives</p>
<p t="1945110" d="7339">the commission of the worst human atrocities is an inevitable social consequence of the refusal of the</p>
<p t="1952760" d="5569">self-conscious individual to make the sacrifices appropriate to establishing a harmonious life and</p>
<p t="1958700" d="5780">their consequent degeneration into a kind of murderous and resentment filled rage</p>
<p t="1965330" d="7190">propagating endlessly through its variations in society until everything comes to an end</p>
<p t="1973040" d="2329">And the next story is the flood</p>
<p t="1976730" d="1830">And it&#39;s not surprising</p>
<p t="1978560" d="3380">Because if things go from bad to worse long enough</p>
<p t="1982700" d="1920">everything Falls</p>
<p t="1984620" d="4489">And it&#39;s a terrifying story. I didn&#39;t understand that story. I didn&#39;t understand that story for years</p>
<p t="1989240" d="2420">It wasn&#39;t really until I read Alexandr Solzhenitsyn</p>
<p t="1992120" d="6050">that I developed, I think, the cognitive capacity then to even understand what the story meant because</p>
<p t="1998690" d="2900">Solzhenitsyn said in its Nobel prize accepting speech</p>
<p t="2002200" d="4520">A single person who stop flying can bring down a tyranny, which is a stunning thing to say</p>
<p t="2006720" d="4739">But I would also say something that&#39;s been amply demonstrated in the 20th century because we have</p>
<p t="2011710" d="6349">historical examples of people who did precisely that. Gandhi did it, Václav Havel did it, Nelson Mandela did it</p>
<p t="2018669" d="5330">Solzhenitsyn&#39;s Gulag Archipelago was definitely one of the ax blows that brought down the Soviet Union</p>
<p t="2024220" d="3180">A stunning achievement for a person who started writing that book by</p>
<p t="2027400" d="4560">memorizing it when he was a concentration camp victim, this far away from starvation</p>
<p t="2032100" d="840">It shows you,</p>
<p t="2033060" d="6460">as clearly as anything possibly can, how powerful the human spirit can be if it&#39;s willing to take on the</p>
<p t="2039780" d="7760">obligation of its relationship with the divine. And also how terrible things can become if the responsibility of that burden is not shouldered</p>
<p t="2048000" d="3300">Now, it&#39;s no wonder as far as I can tell that people don&#39;t think this way because</p>
<p t="2052179" d="2360">Thinking this way is it&#39;s catastrophic in a way</p>
<p t="2054909" d="4939">Because the burden it places on the individual is so extreme that it&#39;s almost unbearable while in a...</p>
<p t="2059849" d="7170">But that&#39;s exactly why it is in Genesis, to begin with, that Adam hides, but he becomes conscious of his own vulnerability</p>
<p t="2067020" d="3750">It&#39;s like, he thinks well a creature such as I, I could never bear such a burden well</p>
<p t="2070839" d="2330">there&#39;s a lot more to people than meets the eye</p>
<p t="2073389" d="4070">And the only way I learned that was by looking at people&#39;s and my own. People&#39;s and my own</p>
<p t="2077530" d="2419">capacity for Evil, because I started to realize that</p>
<p t="2080020" d="7069">we regard ourselves as narrow little beings in a particular kind of box and there&#39;s real comfort in that although there&#39;s tremendous limitation</p>
<p t="2087089" d="4920">You cannot see your way out of that box until you know. Well what I teach my students</p>
<p t="2092010" d="1619">I teach them about Nazi Germany</p>
<p t="2093629" d="5250">and I try to make them understand that there&#39;s an overwhelming probability if they were in Nazi Germany in the</p>
<p t="2099040" d="3799">1930s that they would have been perpetrators and nazis. An overwhelming probability</p>
<p t="2102940" d="5149">And if they can&#39;t accept that, because it&#39;s a historical fact, they have absolutely no idea who they are</p>
<p t="2109000" d="4669">Now, imagining yourself as a nazi perpetrator is an unbearably terrifying thing to do</p>
<p t="2113740" d="1760">But I don&#39;t believe that you can do...</p>
<p t="2115500" d="4050">I don&#39;t think that you have any insight whatsoever into your capacity for good</p>
<p t="2119820" d="4480">until you have some well-developed insight into your capacity for evil</p>
<p t="2124300" d="4460">Because people can tell you till they&#39;re blue in their face about your capacity for good, it just sounds like...</p>
<p t="2129280" d="4550">It sounds like wishful thinking. It sounds like the sort of thing that an advertiser might tell you on TV</p>
<p t="2133830" d="2000">It&#39;s just too good to be true</p>
<p t="2136070" d="2000">And I don&#39;t think people believe it</p>
<p t="2138200" d="5330">But I think that if you tell people that, you know, in the cold dark corners of their mind there are</p>
<p t="2143660" d="3289">motivations that are so terrible that they would, they would traumatize</p>
<p t="2147710" d="5450">themselves if they were ever revealed, that everyone knows at some level of analysis that that&#39;s absolutely true</p>
<p t="2154180" d="4740">You think... There&#39;s evidence throughout history that it&#39;s possible for people to be</p>
<p t="2159940" d="2160">enlightened. And you&#39;d think,</p>
<p t="2162560" d="5570">since enlightenment is viewed as the medication for vulnerability and death that everybody would be struggling</p>
<p t="2168280" d="4780">as hard as they possibly could to be enlightened, if such a state exactly and precisely</p>
<p t="2173080" d="7020">exists, but if the barrier to enlightenment is the development of self consciousness of the individual</p>
<p t="2180220" d="2440">human&#39;s infinite capacity for evil then you can be</p>
<p t="2182880" d="1300">immediately</p>
<p t="2184180" d="2100">convinced about why</p>
<p t="2186500" d="2360">Enlightenment is in such short supply</p>
<p t="2189680" d="1420">When I</p>
<p t="2192340" d="5780">finished my first provisional examination of the sorts of motivations that drove people to set up concentration camps</p>
<p t="2199070" d="4820">and to torture people terribly in those camps, I came to a terrible conclusion</p>
<p t="2204800" d="2000">It was a conclusion that</p>
<p t="2206920" d="5140">I think in some ways was the worst thing that had ever happened to me, maybe intellectually and morally, I thought</p>
<p t="2212800" d="980">I came to understand</p>
<p t="2213790" d="3390">why it is that people depended on their group identity in their cultural identification,</p>
<p t="2217520" d="2660">because that helped protect themselves from their own vulnerability</p>
<p t="2220400" d="5280">You have to believe things because you just don&#39;t know everything so you have to believe things they fill in the gaps</p>
<p t="2225680" d="1140">the beliefs fill in the gaps</p>
<p t="2226820" d="2629">If the beliefs are stripped from you then your</p>
<p t="2229520" d="4250">defenses against the infinite are stripped. And it&#39;s no wonder that people will defend their beliefs</p>
<p t="2236180" d="6109">I thought, well you do if you&#39;re too involved in defending your beliefs, you&#39;re going to be willing to kill other people in their defence</p>
<p t="2242289" d="6291">And we&#39;re so technologically powerful now that we can no longer be willing to kill other people in the defense of our own beliefs because</p>
<p t="2248580" d="1860">the time for that is passed</p>
<p t="2251600" d="3830">And I realized well with you if you don&#39;t stand up for your beliefs you leave yourself bereft</p>
<p t="2255430" d="3170">You&#39;re open to the depredations of the infinite. That&#39;s equally</p>
<p t="2258800" d="2620">intolerable, it seems to leave no way out</p>
<p t="2263900" d="2920">There is a way out, you know, and I think it&#39;s the way out that</p>
<p t="2267440" d="7459">genuinely religious people have tried to offer humanity for thousands and thousands of years. And the way out of the conundrum</p>
<p t="2275620" d="7440">posed to you by your reliance on ideological beliefs and your vulnerability in the face of the unknown, is the development of</p>
<p t="2283160" d="4160">a truly integrated and powerful character. And that&#39;s a</p>
<p t="2287600" d="2000">individual development and it means</p>
<p t="2289760" d="8040">constant confrontation with things you don&#39;t understand and constant attempts to ensure that your character is composed of truth and</p>
<p t="2297880" d="2000">solidity Rather than deceit</p>
<p t="2300160" d="6860">And to make of yourself something that&#39;s built on a rock and not predicated on sand. And the thing is, it&#39;s one thing to tell people that</p>
<p t="2307080" d="2220">because maybe they should take care of themselves</p>
<p t="2309700" d="4220">But I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s enough to tell people because they don&#39;t take care of themselves that well</p>
<p t="2313920" d="5780">But it&#39;s a completely other thing to say look, you know, every time you make a pathological moral decision</p>
<p t="2319700" d="3940">you move the one the world one step closer to complete annihilation</p>
<p t="2323640" d="5280">And I absolutely believe that. I think the historical evidence is crystal clear</p>
<p t="2328920" d="6880">And I also think that every time you make an appropriate moral decision, and you manifest moral courage in the face of your own vulnerability</p>
<p t="2335800" d="3060">then you move the world one step farther from the break</p>
<p t="2339080" d="7900">And every...  that&#39;s the case for every single person. You know, Solzhenitsyn said, drawing on his eastern orthodox christian background:</p>
<p t="2347560" d="2380">Every single person is the center of the world</p>
<p t="2350440" d="6180">As center of the world, not &#39;the&#39; center of the world. The world is a complicated place. It can have all sorts of centers</p>
<p t="2356620" d="2600">It&#39;s hard to believe that you might be one of them, but</p>
<p t="2359900" d="2000">everything about human existence is hard to believe</p>
<p t="2362080" d="3920">The fact that it&#39;s here at all is hard to believe, the nature of it&#39;s hard to believe</p>
<p t="2366280" d="2000">Everything that human beings does is so</p>
<p t="2368980" d="6780">ridiculous and remarkable that it&#39;s like it&#39;s a consistently and constantly unfolding miracle. The idea that each of you might be</p>
<p t="2375880" d="3340">a center of the cosmos, in that</p>
<p t="2379580" d="6980">infinite admixture of ridiculousness and absurdities, is hardly more than one more ridiculous thing to swallow</p>
<p t="2388100" d="2000">Well I&#39;ll summarize, I guess</p>
<p t="2390860" d="2720">I said that tragedy is a precondition for being</p>
<p t="2395840" d="5360">Being is the interplay between the finite and the infinite. And in that interplay there&#39;s tragedy. And there&#39;s no way out of that</p>
<p t="2401500" d="2000">Evil is something different</p>
<p t="2404240" d="7429">Evil is the conscious attempt to make the conditions of existence more pathological than they have to be. And it&#39;s motivated by conscious intent</p>
<p t="2412369" d="5300">The motivations arise because people pay a terrible price for their self conscious awareness</p>
<p t="2417669" d="5811">And that awareness is their awareness of their vulnerability. And that is a terrible thing to be aware of</p>
<p t="2427100" d="8080">That vulnerability can be confronted forthrightly, accepted, and the appropriate decisions made. Alternatively people can retreat into their own</p>
<p t="2436000" d="8240">rationalistic arrogance and attempt to deceive themselves and everyone else about the nature of their own existence and about the nature of reality</p>
<p t="2444240" d="2500">That Pathway leads to nothing but destruction</p>
<p t="2449600" d="4340">I think that there&#39;s good reason to assume that it&#39;s too late in the...</p>
<p t="2453940" d="3620">in our developmental course as a species for that path to be acceptable anymore</p>
<p t="2457880" d="5000">because we&#39;re too powerful, and if too many people stay on that path, we&#39;re going to do ourselves in</p>
<p t="2463480" d="7700">So I would say as we&#39;ve become more technologically powerful, an increasing moral burden is being placed on each of us</p>
<p t="2471180" d="7560">It matters, to the destiny of the cosmos, whether or not you get your moral act straight</p>
<p t="2478860" d="1960">And I don&#39;t mean that in a trivial way</p>
<p t="2481000" d="3540">I believe that that&#39;s as close to an empirical fact as anything that can be demonstrated</p>
<p t="2484540" d="6760">And I also believe that&#39;s as terrifying a thing to consider as anything you could possibly imagine. And maybe it&#39;s too much to ask of people</p>
<p t="2491300" d="2660">But you know our great religious traditions do</p>
<p t="2494020" d="6900">continually remind us that inside every human being there&#39;s a spark of divinity. And that idea is a precondition</p>
<p t="2500920" d="2240">for our entire system of law</p>
<p t="2504500" d="2180">There&#39;s always the possibility that it&#39;s true</p>
<p t="2506680" d="5969">And if it&#39;s true it means that there is an infinite avenue of</p>
<p t="2512980" d="4260">potential that lays open to every single person. And that the ability</p>
<p t="2517400" d="5179">to transform the terrible conditions of reality into something, not only acceptable</p>
<p t="2522580" d="3400">but worthy of celebration, actually lies within our grasp</p>
<p t="2526660" d="7260">An alternative to that, the alternative to that is the continual generation of a kind of hell. That&#39;s so</p>
<p t="2534280" d="3020">incomprehensibly awful that,</p>
<p t="2538060" d="3480">by any reasonable person standards,</p>
<p t="2541540" d="2040">it has to be regarded as something to avoid</p>
<p t="2548500" d="2000">That&#39;s all I have to say about that.</p>
