<p t="8679" d="3530">No problem turn on everything ready</p>
<p t="17289" d="2060">so I'll start by telling you a</p>
<p t="19869" d="2120">Little bit about psychoanalysis now</p>
<p t="22029" d="6200">That's not a very straightforward thing to do because there are a number of different schools of psychoanalysis</p>
<p t="28359" d="2600">And they don't come to the same conclusions</p>
<p t="31660" d="1710">but</p>
<p t="33370" d="2000">I'm going to try to</p>
<p t="36610" d="5689">Tell you what I think is common and deep among the different schools and then</p>
<p t="43960" d="3409">Give credit to the originators [of] the ideas where that's due</p>
<p t="50410" d="1169">psychoanalysis</p>
<p t="51579" d="5000">Is I would say a romantic school of thought and the [reason] for [that] is that</p>
<p t="57399" d="2000">for pSychoanalysts</p>
<p t="60219" d="2479">emotion and motivation are far more important than</p>
<p t="63939" d="1351">rationality and</p>
<p t="65290" d="3680">I would like to point out that that's true</p>
<p t="69790" d="4699">It's it's not a theory. We know a lot more [about] the limitations of</p>
<p t="75280" d="5150">Rationality now partly because of our explorations of artificial intelligence than we did</p>
<p t="81549" d="3230">120 years ago when the pSychoanalysts started their</p>
<p t="85630" d="1500">theorizing</p>
<p t="87130" d="5449">you can't think without motivation and emotion in fact you can't think without a body and</p>
<p t="93670" d="5120">even if you had a body you couldn't think without the surrounding social world and so</p>
<p t="100060" d="3769">For the pSychoanalysts, and this is also true of thinkers like Nietzsche</p>
<p t="106390" d="5389">You make sense out of the world because you're boxed in by Society, and then you're boxed in by your body</p>
<p t="111780" d="7860">and then you're boxed in by your motivations and emotions, and then only inside that circumscribed space can your rationality operate and</p>
<p t="122079" d="4340">Part of the reason for that is [that] most of the world is technically uncomputable?</p>
<p t="127329" d="2000">so for example if</p>
<p t="129789" d="2000">You play chess here's an example?</p>
<p t="133390" d="1530">the fastest</p>
<p t="134920" d="3229">supercomputer ever invented cannot calculate all the permutations</p>
<p t="138400" d="5300">in a single chess game if it ran from the beginning of time till now</p>
<p t="144610" d="1200">and</p>
<p t="145810" d="2000">that's just [the] chess game and</p>
<p t="148360" d="2000">So what happens is that?</p>
<p t="150940" d="5569">Every action you take has consequences and then those consequences have consequences and those consequences</p>
<p t="157300" d="5419">Of the consequences have consequences and you can't compute your way through life</p>
<p t="163000" d="6889">We orient ourselves through life by mechanisms. We really don't understand and the psychoanalysts figured that out</p>
<p t="171250" d="2000">from a quasi scientific</p>
<p t="174100" d="2690">perspective before anyone else</p>
<p t="178840" d="6800">Another way you can think about that is that for centuries or for thousands of years or maybe since the beginning of human?</p>
<p t="187209" d="2000">consciousness it was</p>
<p t="190330" d="1470">accepted as</p>
<p t="191800" d="4369">universal wisdom that human beings were the pawns of the gods</p>
<p t="196690" d="3440">We might say and these were at minimum</p>
<p t="201760" d="7189">Causal forces with personality that operated behind the scenes and whose essential motivations were mysterious to us</p>
<p t="209769" d="3650">now modern people no longer believe that but the</p>
<p t="214000" d="2540">psychoanalysts, began their theorizing</p>
<p t="217060" d="1620">from that</p>
<p t="218680" d="1589">fundamental perspective</p>
<p t="220269" d="3470">even freud who portrayed himself as</p>
<p t="225370" d="2000">rationally</p>
<p t="227830" d="1379">anti-religious</p>
<p t="229209" d="7460">Merely replaced religious notions with notions like the super ego, or the it'd now he localized them inside</p>
<p t="237370" d="2000">but</p>
<p t="239650" d="5059">Whether the gods are inside, or outside makes very little difference to whether or not there [are] gods</p>
<p t="247239" d="2960">Now what the psychoanalysts offered us?</p>
<p t="250840" d="4790">That no other school of pSychology has managed so far is</p>
<p t="256870" d="5510">The notion that human beings are basically a loose collection of spirits</p>
<p t="263979" d="2000">instead of</p>
<p t="267130" d="5569">Entities that are transparent to themselves in primary rot primarily rationale for the pSychoanalyst</p>
<p t="274510" d="2899">you're like a room full of ghosts and</p>
<p t="279699" d="6620">You do you that you think you are might be one ghost among all those ghosts and it even might think that it's the ghost</p>
<p t="286320" d="2000">in charge, but the probability that</p>
<p t="289030" d="5899">The part about being in charge is true is zero. It's simply not the case and</p>
<p t="295960" d="7730">One of the other things that the psycho analysts have to offer which neither the cognitive science scientists nor the even the emotional</p>
<p t="304030" d="2000">Neuroscientists have realized is that?</p>
<p t="306430" d="7580">The structures through which we look [at] the world and [also] the structures that motivate us are actually alive. We don't have</p>
<p t="314710" d="2510">mechanical cognitions, what we have is</p>
<p t="318880" d="4339">What we are is a sequence of embodiment by different motivated spirits</p>
<p t="323220" d="4259">and you know that perfectly well if you watch yourself behaved over a two-week period</p>
<p t="327820" d="3440">You're a different person when you're angry you're a different person [when] you're afraid</p>
<p t="331360" d="4730">You're a different person [when] you argue with someone you love you're a different person when you're confused</p>
<p t="336580" d="2029">you know you're a different person when you're</p>
<p t="339220" d="2119">Egotistical you're a different person when you're wrong</p>
<p t="341340" d="4589">And it takes a [tremendous] amount of psychological development before there's any</p>
<p t="346210" d="5720">Coherence across those multiple selves except the Coherence of memory and post Hoc rationalization</p>
<p t="353320" d="7669">Now one [of] the most terrifying realizations that the psycho analysts lead people to is the realization [that] they are not alone in their heads</p>
<p t="361690" d="4429">Now you can debate whether or not the space that you inhabit is in your head</p>
<p t="366360" d="4920">Because I don't really think that's accurate but I don't think you can debate the proposition that</p>
<p t="372099" d="2450">you are not alone in your being and</p>
<p t="375130" d="5659">It's also very difficult to debate the proposition that you're not the captain of the ship or if you are</p>
<p t="380789" d="2000">There's plenty of skeletons below decks</p>
<p t="386060" d="4339">Now freud for his part even [though] he was a 19th century</p>
<p t="390949" d="2390">Rationalist at least in terms of his formal thinking</p>
<p t="393949" d="3980">was also someone who is painfully aware of the</p>
<p t="398539" d="2000">role of</p>
<p t="400610" d="6020">fundamental irrationality romantic irrationality in People's lives and freud basically concentrated on</p>
<p t="407090" d="7549">the two elements of existence that were particularly an ethe amat to the victorians and one of those was sexuality and</p>
<p t="414979" d="1590">the other was</p>
<p t="416569" d="2000">aggression now</p>
<p t="419870" d="6679">Sexuality was problematic for the victorians, not merely because they were repressive, but because sexuality is a terrible Demon</p>
<p t="426550" d="2000">so to speak [I] mean a</p>
<p t="428930" d="2929">large part of the movie that you just watched is an</p>
<p t="431960" d="5239">Expression of the idea that sexuality is a terrible Demon and also that it's closely allied with aggression</p>
<p t="437199" d="7020">[I] mean the blonde woman is basically possessed and she's possessed to the point where she becomes not only murderous</p>
<p t="444220" d="2000">but Suicidal and</p>
<p t="446900" d="2000">freud</p>
<p t="450380" d="7729">attempted with all his might to point out to the victorians especially the aristocratic victorians who thought of themselves as</p>
<p t="459860" d="7220">rational masters that they were embodied creatures with an animal nature and that they were motivated in large part by</p>
<p t="467539" d="4280">Forces that not only did they not understand but they didn't even want to admit</p>
<p t="472430" d="1440">existed</p>
<p t="473870" d="1349">now</p>
<p t="475219" d="5690">The blonde woman in the initial parts of the movie when she's seen off by her uncle</p>
<p t="481550" d="6140">And aunt is basically dorothy from the wizard of Oz. You know she's she's raised somewhere</p>
<p t="489080" d="3139">by loving relatives and the aunt and the Uncle</p>
<p t="492889" d="1891">[or] the older couple</p>
<p t="494780" d="1080">Played that role</p>
<p t="495860" d="7460">[they're] they wish her well in her wonderful adventure into Hollywood and [she] naively accepts their benevolence as you know an</p>
<p t="504289" d="5990">Appropriate way [of] interacting with her and of course. It's not appropriate at all. She's naive right to the bloody core</p>
<p t="511219" d="3050">Whoever really were her parents did an absolutely?</p>
<p t="515029" d="7820">dismal job of preparing her [for] reality they allowed her to nurture naive princess-like fantasies that are so</p>
<p t="524150" d="7459">Fractured and sketchy that there there there they have zero adaptive utility and they basically set her up for</p>
<p t="532250" d="4400">Catastrophic failure and from the freudian perspective, that's an eatable story</p>
<p t="537560" d="5809">Because the fundamental lesson of freud's oedipal theory is do not let</p>
<p t="543980" d="2840">your theoretically benevolent caretakers</p>
<p t="547580" d="2149">Delude you into naive Faith</p>
<p t="550820" d="4669">So in the freudian scheme of things the eatable mother for example</p>
<p t="556490" d="2000">Infantile [isis] her son</p>
<p t="558770" d="6679">Now freud read that as a familial pathology, and you read that as a as a mythological</p>
<p t="566180" d="2989">Pathology even though freud did talk about oedipus as a myth and</p>
<p t="570350" d="5959">freud's basic idea with regards to the eatable complex was that it's very easy for</p>
<p t="577010" d="4309">a mother to entice her son, but even more broadly</p>
<p t="582320" d="4609">For parents to entice their children into a false sense of dependent</p>
<p t="587090" d="5779">security by helping them pretend that the world is much more benevolent and simple than it really is a</p>
<p t="593840" d="5899">Freud's observation of that was that the reason that the parents did that was twofold one was that they were</p>
<p t="600260" d="5089">Cowardly and unable to look at the world as it really was and second that their fundamental aim was to</p>
<p t="606410" d="7519">Eradicate the independent strivings of their children so [that] they would never leave home so that the parents didn't have to suffer from Loneliness</p>
<p t="614330" d="6950">So it's an ugly ugly ugly story, and this is partly why freud is being met with so much resistance. There's lots of reasons</p>
<p t="621280" d="2819">But he's absolutely right the in freud's</p>
<p t="624680" d="3920">basically Oedipal theory was [that]</p>
<p t="629150" d="4250">The most difficult thing that a human being has to do is to develop enough</p>
<p t="634040" d="2000">independence to break away from</p>
<p t="636590" d="1710">the</p>
<p t="638300" d="2900">Maternal nest or the familial nest</p>
<p t="641520" d="2140">so that they can live an independent existence</p>
<p t="643860" d="2320">and that there's multiple ways that that can be seriously</p>
<p t="646400" d="2539">interfered with some of which border on</p>
<p t="649490" d="2000">Incestuous and</p>
<p t="652010" d="2000">I mean I</p>
<p t="654030" d="5570">Appreciated that when I first read freud but once I became a clinical psychologist. [I] thought well</p>
<p t="659600" d="6539">Yeah, that's that's just exactly how it is. I never have anybody in my therapy practice whose parents made them, too</p>
<p t="666870" d="3650">Independent that never happens never I</p>
<p t="671070" d="5030">I have any number [of] people in my clinical practice whose parents seriously?</p>
<p t="676560" d="4280">interfered with their children's striving towards independence, so and</p>
<p t="681420" d="2600">Freud believed that was universal he believed that</p>
<p t="684270" d="6320">the [reason] the Oedipal myth was universal was because it was very difficult for creatures who had as long a history of</p>
<p t="690780" d="6769">Dependence as human beings and who were born so helpless to develop an independent identity</p>
<p t="698340" d="5380">given the need for their protection across you know an 18 year period So</p>
<p t="704820" d="1500">Jung</p>
<p t="707100" d="4820">[viewed] that in a slightly more profound manner in some ways because he thought of it as a problem that</p>
<p t="712220" d="2640">Transcended the mere family because Jung believed that</p>
<p t="715860" d="7340">The one of the temptations of consciousness itself was to hide from reality and [that] you didn't necessarily need any parental</p>
<p t="724440" d="6799">Interference with your development to hide your head head in the sand from the true nature of reality like someone who was naive</p>
<p t="731820" d="3109">So he believed that that was also an existential problem</p>
<p t="734930" d="6510">And he believed that partly because he was a student of Nietzsche who observed quite rightly that much of what passes for</p>
<p t="741540" d="7069">Morality is in fact Cowardice and of course this movie picks up on that theme to some tremendous degree because although</p>
<p t="748860" d="2000">Betty is very naive</p>
<p t="751380" d="2390">Part of that naivety is merely Cowardice</p>
<p t="753770" d="5640">she just does she just doesn't have any life experience at all and you see very rapidly in the movie that when she's</p>
<p t="760020" d="5839">Actually presented with temptation her facade of you know naive morality is</p>
<p t="766710" d="7369">Eradicated instantly the second she's given any temptation so she falls prey to the love affairs she break</p>
<p t="774330" d="2000">she is</p>
<p t="776460" d="3649">Hesitates not at all to break and enter. She ends up hiring a murderer</p>
<p t="780110" d="5940">I mean, she's not a good girl Betty you know [betty] liked the betty in the Archie comics</p>
<p t="786050" d="1080">She's not a good girl at all</p>
<p t="787130" d="7590">she's just someone who's so inexperienced and clueless that she lives in an Oedipal dreamworld and she thinks of Hollywood as a</p>
<p t="795090" d="2630">magical fantasy place where dreams come true</p>
<p t="798050" d="1410">Like they do for Cinderella</p>
<p t="799460" d="7679">and you see the cinderella motif the first time she encounters the director and does her scene when she's singing like some princess and</p>
<p t="807140" d="3539">Then she has to run [out] at the last moment. You know. There's a bit of a brief</p>
<p t="811680" d="2690">Utilization of the myth of Cinderella, and they're just like there is</p>
<p t="815160" d="6859">Utilization of the idea of the Wizard of oz I mean betty is basically dorothy and you see the great and wonderful oz</p>
<p t="822690" d="2000">manipulating things behind the scenes</p>
<p t="825450" d="1860">so</p>
<p t="827310" d="4940">So the psychoanalytic perspective is that people are inhabited by multiple spirits?</p>
<p t="832250" d="3419">and they are not clearly the masters in their own houses and and</p>
<p t="836700" d="5960">As far as I'm concerned to not believe [that] is mere naivety it seems to me especially</p>
<p t="843150" d="4969">As a consequence of thinking of it for so long that it's self-evidently true and that if people</p>
<p t="848880" d="4789">Merely meditate on that in their own life for any period of time they can understand that very rapidly</p>
<p t="854790" d="4579">Now the second thing [that] the pSychoanalysts really brought to the Forefront</p>
<p t="860400" d="2000">along with their emphasis on</p>
<p t="862650" d="7760">irrationality so motivation and emotion say was their emphasis on both the unconscious and on dreams now freud was really the</p>
<p t="870600" d="6140">great formalizer of the idea of the unconscious although there were many precursors to that idea the</p>
<p t="877200" d="2779">Archaic idea of the Underworld for example is a</p>
<p t="880770" d="3469">romantic and religious precursor of the idea of the unconscious</p>
<p t="885450" d="1920">the ancients</p>
<p t="887370" d="4849">Externalized the unconscious and thought about it as the place of gods Whereas by the time we had freud</p>
<p t="892410" d="7579">We started to believe that most of the unexplained complexity in the world was actually localized inside our head. Which is not clearly true</p>
<p t="900870" d="1170">anyways</p>
<p t="902040" d="5000">for Freud and then again for Jung, the unconscious was the place of</p>
<p t="907740" d="3950">either disguised Secrets which would be the freudian [Viewpoint] or</p>
<p t="914010" d="5299">Knowledge that had not yet come to be which was the Jungian viewpoint now</p>
<p t="919309" d="2790">I think Jung wins that argument hands down although</p>
<p t="922100" d="5940">[I] have seen people who were compartmentalized [in] their thinking in exactly the manner that freud</p>
<p t="928980" d="1380">described</p>
<p t="930360" d="1649">now</p>
<p t="932009" d="2000">freud believed that</p>
<p t="934709" d="6589">fantasies in some sense and you could include this movie as an example of fantasies like that were essentially wish</p>
<p t="941699" d="500">fulfillment</p>
<p t="942199" d="5669">And that what they fulfilled were unconscious wishes and unconscious wishes were are often</p>
<p t="948239" d="7070">Wishes that were generated [by] parts of the psyche that were had either not been allowed to manifest themselves properly</p>
<p t="955679" d="2960">Let's say in the case of sort of Id generated</p>
<p t="959549" d="3680">fantasies or that that had been actively repressed</p>
<p t="967860" d="6949">That the ability to distinguish between what's merely underdeveloped and what's actively replace repressed</p>
<p t="974809" d="4830">That's not such an easy distinction to make and it's conceivable that it's valid</p>
<p t="981420" d="5269">Especially in situations that are like the freudian Oedipal situation where people are raised in</p>
<p t="986819" d="3770">Situations where all Sorts of things are merely not allowed to exist</p>
<p t="990749" d="7309">Which is [Beti] state of mind when she naively encounters [hollywood] for Jung the situation was more complex, and I think</p>
<p t="999059" d="5960">Jung had a dream once that he was excavating a basement with freud which is of course essentially what he was doing and that</p>
<p t="1005179" d="2990">He dug underneath what freud was digging</p>
<p t="1008689" d="3200">Was was excavating and he found a an iMmense</p>
<p t="1012529" d="6049">Cellar basement mansion with thousands and thousands of rooms and I think that's exactly right</p>
<p t="1018579" d="5699">I think that is what Jung did in relationship to Freud it was in some ways as if Freud opened the door and</p>
<p t="1025159" d="2451">and Jung stepped through it</p>
<p t="1027610" d="5819">And it was very hard on you on freud because there were limits to the places that he was willing to go even though</p>
<p t="1033429" d="2000">He was a very courageous person</p>
<p t="1036139" d="3260">Jung believed that dreams could be revelatory and</p>
<p t="1040069" d="7651">And he has a very very very sophisticated theory about how [that] might come about so for Jung</p>
<p t="1047720" d="2000">the Dream was and</p>
<p t="1049760" d="2000">You can include in the dream</p>
<p t="1052179" d="6959">All genuine art all genuine literature all the elements of human creativity that we would consider fine arts or humanities</p>
<p t="1059629" d="3290">Based anything that's like that that's not ideological</p>
<p t="1064220" d="3649">Would fall for you under the rubric of compensatory</p>
<p t="1068600" d="7789">Fantasy so jung's idea was that the ego basically attempted to impose a coherent and somewhat simplified</p>
<p t="1077090" d="5270">Perspective on the world Which would be like Betty's initial Viewpoint and that the fantasy world</p>
<p t="1082639" d="7820">Did everything it can could to account for what that system could not account for and then to try to start making?</p>
<p t="1090460" d="6959">sense out of it and the reason it used fantasy and dreams and artistic productions and so on even rituals is because</p>
<p t="1097850" d="7159">The non understood reality has to be acted out and presented an image before it can be understood [in] any articulated Manner</p>
<p t="1105259" d="6091">So for Jung it was also a theory [of] the progression of knowledge, so for Jung</p>
<p t="1111350" d="1740">the intellect and</p>
<p t="1113090" d="1199">articulated knowledge</p>
<p t="1114289" d="1651">occupied a very limited and</p>
<p t="1115940" d="5959">Circumscribed space and then outside of that area there was the dream world which included all [of] artistic production</p>
<p t="1121909" d="4820">And then outside [of] that was the unknown itself and the way the unknown was</p>
<p t="1127129" d="5239">Transmitted to the conscious articulated mind was through a lengthy process of dreamlike</p>
<p t="1132830" d="1020">representation and</p>
<p t="1133850" d="4789">every time you go see a movie [or] every time you read a book of fiction or every time you have a fantasy or a</p>
<p t="1138639" d="7800">Dream you're participating in the process by which what's truly unknown is transformed through the dream into articulated</p>
<p t="1146779" d="7489">Knowledge and any way any genuine artist does that and this is part of the place where I have some trouble with David Lynch</p>
<p t="1154850" d="4459">Because lynch is clearly a post-freudian. He's like Salvador Deli and</p>
<p t="1161360" d="4130">psychoanalytic thought can easily become ideological it happened very frequently with freud's</p>
<p t="1165590" d="4159">Followers it happened in the case of artists like Salvador Dali too who would take</p>
<p t="1170509" d="2000">Freud's</p>
<p t="1173659" d="7369">excavation of symbolic language and then use it consciously in a in a in a manner that that</p>
<p t="1181460" d="2000">[aped] or mimicked</p>
<p t="1183769" d="1530">true</p>
<p t="1185299" d="5489">spontaneous symbolic revelation, and [I] could never escape the deep suspicion that that</p>
<p t="1192149" d="2150">Lynch is doing exactly the same thing</p>
<p t="1194309" d="2330">He's a little too calculated for me</p>
<p t="1197039" d="4640">You know and because the film for example could be laid [out] in a linear structure</p>
<p t="1201679" d="6300">but it's as if he laid it out in linear structure, and then randomized it which I [think] is a rather cheap trick and and</p>
<p t="1211470" d="4099">He the film lacks. I think what you see in truly</p>
<p t="1216240" d="3589">Deep symbolic movies which is the revelation of something Beyond?</p>
<p t="1220110" d="4849">Understanding what lynch attempts to make the audience feel as far as I'm concerned</p>
<p t="1224960" d="6329">Is that he is revealing something that's not yet understood, but I think Lynch understands, too</p>
<p t="1231289" d="7530">Well what he's doing and and he's playing a freudian game with the audience. Just like [Salvador] Dali did now that doesn't mean he isn't</p>
<p t="1239730" d="4189">Creative because he is and the film is fascinating to watch, but there's something about it [that]</p>
<p t="1244889" d="1831">there's a lack of</p>
<p t="1246720" d="7819">there's a lack of spontaneity about what he's doing that to me makes him into a quasi freudian, ideologue and</p>
<p t="1255480" d="1949">That sort of thing is</p>
<p t="1257429" d="5780">genuinely generally, not that helpful [a] real artist is someone who is</p>
<p t="1263820" d="4969">Isn't using symbols to Express what they're attempting to express a real artist is</p>
<p t="1269700" d="7579">Attempting to Express what has not yet been expressed and has no choice other than to use imagistic or symbolic</p>
<p t="1277529" d="6230">representations because there isn't anything else yet, and you can really see this when you read someone like</p>
<p t="1285480" d="1559">Nietzsche</p>
<p t="1287039" d="3800">But even more so in the case of Jung because Jung is quite obscure</p>
<p t="1291179" d="5839">But the reason he's obscure is because the things he was writing about are way more obscure than you</p>
<p t="1297630" d="1289">so</p>
<p t="1298919" d="2599">Spreader you can see this especially in his writings about alchemy</p>
<p t="1301639" d="6330">I mean alchemy is so obscure that it's basically incomprehensible, and young's writings on alchemy are almost</p>
<p t="1308700" d="5209">Understandable, and that actually constitutes a move forward, but jung is not trying to [be] obscure</p>
<p t="1313909" d="4110">He's trying to be as clear as it possibly can whereas with Lynch [I] feel</p>
<p t="1318539" d="5430">Every time I watch a Lynch movie. I feel uneasy and as if I'm being manipulated because the</p>
<p t="1324490" d="1470">complexity is</p>
<p t="1325960" d="1710">more than the</p>
<p t="1327670" d="3709">information demands, so he's playing a game and</p>
<p t="1332770" d="2000">I think that that's</p>
<p t="1335049" d="5180">I think that that's a pSeudo intellectual move because what someone who's</p>
<p t="1340690" d="2630">Genuinely exploring is trying try is</p>
<p t="1343929" d="6650">What someone genuinely exploring is trying to do is to lay out something complex as simply as possible?</p>
<p t="1351040" d="7039">[now] it still may be incredibly complex, but the complexity isn't added for the point of mystification and</p>
<p t="1359410" d="2419">Lynch plays so many games and</p>
<p t="1362530" d="6139">I think I see most of his films that I just can't suppress the notion that there's something rotten in the state of Denmark</p>
<p t="1369549" d="1711">so</p>
<p t="1371260" d="4010">All right, so what's the basic statement, and then I'll [start] what's the basic theme?</p>
<p t="1375270" d="4500">well the basic theme to me is the the terrible gap between</p>
<p t="1380980" d="2689">naive and motivated innocence, so it's</p>
<p t="1384340" d="1380">overprotected</p>
<p t="1385720" d="5270">fantasizing and you know the cataclysmic sexual and aggressive nature of reality and we</p>
<p t="1391840" d="6709">And lynch weaves together a narrative of a an innocent and naive not innocent naive</p>
<p t="1398770" d="2000">[they're] not the same thing a</p>
<p t="1400990" d="1410">Naive girl</p>
<p t="1402400" d="2000">Who has unrealistic?</p>
<p t="1404679" d="6440">expectations both of the world and of herself and her like absolutely traumatic [encounter] with the</p>
<p t="1411730" d="2060">Subterranean realities [of] the L.A. scene</p>
<p t="1414820" d="5900">Now we do know just so you know that if you want to be developed post-traumatic stress disorder</p>
<p t="1420720" d="5849">which is sort of what happens to the girl in this movie the best way to do that is to be really really naive and</p>
<p t="1426970" d="2000">then go somewhere horrible and</p>
<p t="1429520" d="1800">that'll do it and</p>
<p t="1431320" d="1830">often what the</p>
<p t="1433150" d="5809">Clinical observations are is that when soldiers for example go off to battle and develop post-traumatic stress disorder?</p>
<p t="1439000" d="5599">It's often because of something that's revealed about themselves rather than something that they see</p>
<p t="1445179" d="7070">So you know there are cases for example [of] post-traumatic stress disorder where people are on duties like body cleanup</p>
<p t="1452450" d="1479">but generally speaking</p>
<p t="1453929" d="5689">soldiers developed post-traumatic stress disorder when they see themselves doing something they could never imagine doing and</p>
<p t="1460470" d="2000">What that means to some degree?</p>
<p t="1462899" d="4070">They're naive about the treating themselves and a few managers in General</p>
<p t="1485410" d="2189">I'll just say a little bit about movies in General</p>
<p t="1487880" d="5089">And I would also like to say a little bit about how genuine revelations are possible</p>
<p t="1493549" d="2000">because one of the</p>
<p t="1501620" d="1799">Because what freud?</p>
<p t="1503419" d="7160">Hypothesized was basically that your mind operated like a video recorder in some sense that you were recording</p>
<p t="1510770" d="6709">Reality all the time and that what you were recorded was reality and that were some elements of that reality that you didn't find</p>
<p t="1517909" d="7310">acceptable because of your familial or cultural conditioning, and so you would [just] put those somewhere which would be the unconscious and</p>
<p t="1525980" d="1530">[know] [and]</p>
<p t="1527510" d="5779">Forbid them to Emerge in this case. They would emerge in fantasies and dreams in a somewhat work sense and</p>
<p t="1534289" d="2000">They would have to</p>
<p t="1536330" d="7640">Disguise their true content and symbol so as to not upset the statement [receiving] the repressive now</p>
<p t="1544640" d="6229">There's a whole bunch about that that's wrong and too complicated first of all you don't incorporate like [Athenian] [Phase]</p>
<p t="1552289" d="2750">II lots of things happen to you that you don't understand</p>
<p t="1555740" d="5869">So so you don't have to repress them to not be clear about them you just don't understand them third</p>
<p t="1561610" d="4260">There's no real evidence for the kind of censoring or a sensory mechanism</p>
<p t="1565870" d="3929">That's [probably] talked about you on the other hand said no no no</p>
<p t="1570590" d="3949">The dream is doing its best to make something that's not clear clear</p>
<p t="1575150" d="5869">Now you can't make it any clearer than it is making it because that's the limit of understanding now</p>
<p t="1581020" d="2909">That's exactly what your participated in when you go to remove</p>
<p t="1584870" d="2000">So you can imagine</p>
<p t="1889330" d="3469">La is where all the movies are made but it's also where most of most of the</p>
<p t="1892929" d="2720">Pornographic movies are made although you know Eastern Europe is</p>
<p t="1896440" d="2720">coming up pretty hard behind that so</p>
<p t="1900340" d="2000">there is the</p>
<p t="1903700" d="2540">Myth the fantasy it's not even a myth</p>
<p t="1906240" d="6239">It's a naive fantasy and then there's the actuality and I mean La is a fascinating place partly because it contains so many contradictions</p>
<p t="1912520" d="3919">But you know it's definitely the place where dreams go to die</p>
<p t="1917440" d="5540">So and that's certainly what's portrayed at least in part in this movie, [so] [that's] all I have to [say] about that</p>
