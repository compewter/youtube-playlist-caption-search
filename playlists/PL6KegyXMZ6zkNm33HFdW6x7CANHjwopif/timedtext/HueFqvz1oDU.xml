<p t="940" d="9359">So, I want to take another look at this figure
to begin with.</p>
<p t="10299" d="12101">Now, one of the reasons that I began to think
about these sorts of things is because I wanted</p>
<p t="22400" d="9710">to understand what it might mean to have a
set of, let’s say a set of values and beliefs</p>
<p t="32110" d="4410">(because those two things go together), that
would…</p>
<p t="36520" d="5539">I guess part of the question was, is it possible
to develop of system of beliefs that’s outside</p>
<p t="42059" d="1000">of the realm of ideology?</p>
<p t="43059" d="9070">You know, because one thing you might claim
is that it’s all ideology.</p>
<p t="52129" d="3671">Any belief system is ideological.</p>
<p t="55800" d="5129">And if you develop a belief system that criticises
other belief systems it just means that you’ve</p>
<p t="60929" d="5501">developed a new ideological stance.</p>
<p t="66430" d="2754">And there’s some… that’s a good argument,
you know.</p>
<p t="69184" d="3116">I can think of a number of ways that it’s
true.</p>
<p t="72300" d="7100">One of the things Nietzsche said in the late
1800s was that if you inhabited a belief system,</p>
<p t="79400" d="6810">even a religious system, and you lost faith
in it, not only did you lose faith in that</p>
<p t="86210" d="5540">system, but you also potentially lost faith
in systems themselves.</p>
<p t="91750" d="2280">And so, it was a meta-collapse, in a sense.</p>
<p t="94030" d="3900">Not only did you lose your belief, but you
lost your belief in beliefs.</p>
<p t="97930" d="6170">So you think of the set of all possible beliefs
and then abandoning any hope of relying on</p>
<p t="104100" d="7520">those as valid sources of information.</p>
<p t="111620" d="4490">You know, so that’s one perspective and
it’s a powerful one, and Nietzsche believed</p>
<p t="116110" d="6770">that that was a certain pathway to nihilism,
essentially, or perhaps to a reactionary totalitarianism,</p>
<p t="122880" d="2970">but it boils down to the same thing.</p>
<p t="125850" d="7910">I’ve been reading this book recently, the
title of which I can’t remember, unfortunately.</p>
<p t="133760" d="2710">But I’ll tell it to you after class.</p>
<p t="136470" d="9730">It’s a critique of certain lines of left-wing
ideological thinking, including the existential</p>
<p t="146200" d="4690">thought of people like Jean-Paul Sartre, and
Foucault.</p>
<p t="150890" d="5390">And one of the most trenchant critiques of
Sartre, because he believes that you have</p>
<p t="156280" d="5730">an absolute freedom, that you’re destined
for freedom, that you’re doomed to it, in</p>
<p t="162010" d="1860">some sense.</p>
<p t="163870" d="6421">And that part of your existential journey
is to establish an authenticity that’s correct</p>
<p t="170291" d="1000">for you.</p>
<p t="171291" d="7479">But he doesn’t, he isn’t able really to
give any description of what that should be</p>
<p t="178770" d="1000">grounded in.</p>
<p t="179770" d="10350">And the critic concludes that all Sartre can
do is stand outside of any potential belief</p>
<p t="190120" d="2260">system and criticise it.</p>
<p t="192380" d="4719">And that that’s… there’s nothing in
it for anyone as a consequence of that.</p>
<p t="197099" d="1891">It’s only destructive.</p>
<p t="198990" d="7040">Now, it’s important to remember, with regards
to Sartre, that he viewed other people, to</p>
<p t="206030" d="7400">some degree, like the common man, the bourgeoisie,
we might say, as the embodiment of non-freedom,</p>
<p t="213430" d="5389">of inauthenticity, and also as a barrier to
genuine authenticity.</p>
<p t="218819" d="5781">So he wasn’t willing to give any credence
to the utility of normality.</p>
<p t="224600" d="4120">But I also think he wasn’t able to tolerate
the consequences of his own thought, because</p>
<p t="228720" d="6080">he was an avid supporter of the communist
party, far after anyone with any reasonable</p>
<p t="234800" d="2060">moral sense would have stopped doing that.</p>
<p t="236860" d="5209">So Sartre didn’t really denounce the communists
until the end of the… beginning of the 70s,</p>
<p t="242069" d="1000">roughly speaking.</p>
<p t="243069" d="3281">He was never a card-carrying communist, but
he was very left-leaning.</p>
<p t="246350" d="7690">And you know by the 1970s, by the late 60s,
by the early 70s, a lot of the evidence about</p>
<p t="254040" d="5300">what was going on in Soviet Russia had been
in for 30 years.</p>
<p t="259340" d="5920">So there was really no excuse for not facing
up to that, and trying to understand what</p>
<p t="265260" d="1000">it meant.</p>
<p t="266260" d="2900">And you know, it would be bad enough if it
was just the Soviet Union, but it wasn’t.</p>
<p t="269160" d="9080">The same sort of thing happened wherever those
utopian presuppositions were put into place.</p>
<p t="278240" d="5060">And I suppose many of you don’t know this,
but Pol Pot, who was the Cambodian dictator,</p>
<p t="283300" d="7820">was educated at the Sorbonne, and he wrote
his thesis (I think it was his PhD thesis,</p>
<p t="291120" d="8980">although it might have been his Master’s
thesis) on the Marxist doctrine that urban</p>
<p t="300100" d="3960">people were parasites on rural people.</p>
<p t="304060" d="5960">So you know, there’s a theory that says
that the general value is generated purely</p>
<p t="310020" d="5350">by labour, and much of that is rural labour,
and the cities siphon off the excess productive</p>
<p t="315370" d="5960">power and are able to parasitize the countryside
as a consequence of that.</p>
<p t="321330" d="7530">Which is a, you know, tremendously non-productive
theory.</p>
<p t="328860" d="4300">But Pol Pot put it in practice, and so when
he went back to Cambodia he chased everybody</p>
<p t="333160" d="3210">out of the cities and killed about six million
people.</p>
<p t="336370" d="2930">So, you know, you can read about that if you
want.</p>
<p t="339300" d="3640">It’s a pretty appalling section of 20th
century history.</p>
<p t="342940" d="7860">Especially when it was the case that he was
educated in the West and had these presuppositions</p>
<p t="350800" d="1650">drummed into him.</p>
<p t="352450" d="3670">Well then there’s Foucault.</p>
<p t="356120" d="4840">Foucault, who I have no respect for, by the
way…</p>
<p t="360960" d="3880">I’ve read a fair bit of Foucault, and I
think everything he says is obvious.</p>
<p t="364840" d="6829">So for example, he criticises the idea of
mental illness as a social construct.</p>
<p t="371669" d="2720">It’s like, well yeah, obviously.</p>
<p t="374389" d="5581">I mean, it’s not like psychiatrists and
psychologists and mental health professionals,</p>
<p t="379970" d="4570">who are relatively well-informed, haven’t
known about that since… for the last 60</p>
<p t="384540" d="1000">years.</p>
<p t="385540" d="7530">I mean, it might be a revelation to people
who don’t notice that psychiatry, for example,</p>
<p t="393070" d="6150">is something like a compromise between the
patient biology and the social world.</p>
<p t="399220" d="6810">You know, I mean, psychiatric ailments often
have a biological tilt, but the way they manifest</p>
<p t="406030" d="8620">themselves in society is clearly conditioned
in very intense ways by the particular conditions</p>
<p t="414650" d="5090">obtaining at the point that the person who
has that biological predisposition exists,</p>
<p t="419740" d="6220">even when it’s not pathological, can be
tilted one way or another by cultural norms.</p>
<p t="425960" d="4120">And then of course, when you’re dealing
with issues like insurance payment, and treatment,</p>
<p t="430080" d="5830">and hospitalisation, obviously you’re pulling
in all sorts of systems that are by no means</p>
<p t="435910" d="2009">purely scientific.</p>
<p t="437919" d="3241">But I don’t find it a particularly useful
critique.</p>
<p t="441160" d="3710">It’s obvious, as far as I’m concerned.</p>
<p t="444870" d="1880">And, the other thing that Foucault did.</p>
<p t="446750" d="6280">I mean, I think this is the typical, especially
the French intellectuals’, typical sleight</p>
<p t="453030" d="5300">of hand once Marxism became… you know, once
you were no longer able to call yourself a</p>
<p t="458330" d="7030">committed Marxist, because committed Marxism
had led to unbelievable brutality, you know,</p>
<p t="465360" d="6790">on a scale that had never been experienced
in the entire history of the planet, at least</p>
<p t="472150" d="3580">in terms of its reach and duration.</p>
<p t="475730" d="3490">You didn’t get to call yourself a committed
Marxist anymore, unless there were people</p>
<p t="479220" d="5130">(and you still see them) saying “well that
wasn’t real Marxism), which I think is a</p>
<p t="484350" d="2080">cop-out of staggering proportions.</p>
<p t="486430" d="4920">It usually means “well if I was the person
running the country that wouldn’t have happened”.</p>
<p t="491350" d="4770">That’s the logic behind it… “they didn’t
put the principles into practice properly”.</p>
<p t="496120" d="3410">It’s like yeah well lots of people put the
damn principles into practice and the same</p>
<p t="499530" d="1449">thing happened everywhere.</p>
<p t="500979" d="5271">So at some point you have to kind of wonder
if there’s something wrong with the principles.</p>
<p t="506250" d="7310">Anyways, what Foucault did was take the Marxist
presupposition that everything could be boiled</p>
<p t="513560" d="5349">down to economics and economic power and translate
it into the idea that everything just translated</p>
<p t="518909" d="1651">into power, you know.</p>
<p t="520560" d="5130">And that the reason that we have institiutions
is to include and to exclude and that the</p>
<p t="525690" d="4360">institutions always run for the benefit of
those at the top.</p>
<p t="530050" d="6340">It’s like well yeah, that’s a little bit
true, but it’s… a scientist would look</p>
<p t="536390" d="6120">at that and say well probably… you know,
power dynamics in a functioning economic and</p>
<p t="542510" d="7480">political system maybe account for 10% of
the variance, something like that, maybe 15%.</p>
<p t="549990" d="3430">It’s like, say you want to go to an Ivy
League school.</p>
<p t="553420" d="4210">Well if you’re parents went to the school
you’re more likely to get in, but you’re</p>
<p t="557630" d="4470">not that much more likely to get in and you
still have to be… you know roughly speaking</p>
<p t="562100" d="6570">what happens is if you have a pretty decent
high school GPA and you do very well on the</p>
<p t="568670" d="5370">SATs, and you have some other talents of some
sort, because that’s also necessary, then</p>
<p t="574040" d="4730">they might pick you over someone else who’s
roughly equally qualified if you have a familial</p>
<p t="578770" d="2010">history attendance at the school.</p>
<p t="580780" d="8650">So obviously you get an advantage, but it’s
not the kind of advantage that accounts for</p>
<p t="589430" d="3020">the entirety of how the system is structured.</p>
<p t="592450" d="1120">It’s an advantage.</p>
<p t="593570" d="2110">Well, you can say that’s not fair.</p>
<p t="595680" d="2540">It’s like, yeah okay, fair enough.</p>
<p t="598220" d="8750">Most systems are certainly not 100% either
fair or just, definitely not.</p>
<p t="606970" d="6900">But, you know, instead of comparing them to
utopia you might compare them to another system,</p>
<p t="613870" d="1680">which is the only reasonable way to do it.</p>
<p t="615550" d="4120">It’s like, everything looks terrible when
you compare it to the best thing you can possibly</p>
<p t="619670" d="1000">imagine.</p>
<p t="620670" d="6510">But the best thing you can possibly imagine
is an empty fiction, because it’s so devoid</p>
<p t="627180" d="3599">of detailed content that you can’t use it
as a guide to reality.</p>
<p t="630779" d="7361">Now, I mean, the idea that things could be
better has its roots in, in some sense, a</p>
<p t="638140" d="3720">broad-scale utopian project, and I believe
things could be better.</p>
<p t="641860" d="4090">But that doesn’t mean that when you’re
doing an analysis of a complex system you</p>
<p t="645950" d="4889">get to compare it to an ideological utopia
and then describe all the reasons that it’s</p>
<p t="650839" d="1000">bad.</p>
<p t="651839" d="3631">It’s not appropriate to do that.</p>
<p t="655470" d="5010">It’s too simplistic, you’re not going
to do anything to actually address the problems</p>
<p t="660480" d="4560">that the system has if you take that approach.</p>
<p t="665040" d="4950">And then, of course, pure utopian thinking
is extraordinarily dangerous.</p>
<p t="669990" d="7860">Because if you think that you’re way of
molding society into some ultimate state of</p>
<p t="677850" d="5580">perfection is headed towards some ultimate
state of perfection, then you can justify</p>
<p t="683430" d="4750">absolutely anything you do right now, on the
basis of the fact that things are going to</p>
<p t="688180" d="2260">improve so radically in the future.</p>
<p t="690440" d="2590">And that means any of your behaviours are
excused.</p>
<p t="693030" d="2520">The end is worth it.</p>
<p t="695550" d="10909">Well, if someone says that, you have to kind
of wonder what they’re actually planning</p>
<p t="706459" d="1851">to do.</p>
<p t="708310" d="4279">Okay, so, well what’s the issue?</p>
<p t="712589" d="6791">The issue is that it’s… so the same critic,
with regards to Foucault, said that well it’s</p>
<p t="719380" d="9980">basically the same thing, that Foucault criticised
a variety of profound institutions.</p>
<p t="729360" d="4900">Sexual institutions say, like marriage, and
then institutions of power, like prisons,</p>
<p t="734260" d="5050">and institutions of mental health, like the
whole institutional framework.</p>
<p t="739310" d="3610">He criticised them on the basis of power and
exclusion.</p>
<p t="742920" d="4340">And you could do that and there’s some truth
in it.</p>
<p t="747260" d="4800">But you know Foucault also made the presupposition,
and the problem with that presupposition,</p>
<p t="752060" d="5070">that everything is about something else, is
that it’s almost impossible to see how it</p>
<p t="757130" d="2790">can’t be applied to Foucault himself.</p>
<p t="759920" d="6930">So you’d have to ask, if you were a student
of Foucault, what power aims drove his attempt</p>
<p t="766850" d="3120">to analyse everything in terms of power?</p>
<p t="769970" d="3850">And I actually think with Foucault it’s
pretty obvious.</p>
<p t="773820" d="1990">But it’s a game that never goes anywhere.</p>
<p t="775810" d="7330">Okay, so I thought about that a lot, it’s
like, is there any system that you can develop</p>
<p t="783140" d="4030">that doesn’t have the negative consequences
of systems in general?</p>
<p t="787170" d="4670">And then if that is possible, how and why
might it be possible?</p>
<p t="791840" d="6340">And this is partly why I’m talking to you
about this particular diagram again.</p>
<p t="798180" d="4270">I think the reason, now I don’t know this,
and you guys can think it through yourself.</p>
<p t="802450" d="4340">I mean, lots of people have talked to me about
the content of this course and you know, they’ve</p>
<p t="806790" d="6040">said that it’s been very helpful for them
when it comes to interpreting certain elements</p>
<p t="812830" d="2320">of their life.</p>
<p t="815150" d="3379">But some people have said well it’s just
another system.</p>
<p t="818529" d="3171">And I don’t believe that.</p>
<p t="821700" d="1720">I think it’s a meta-system.</p>
<p t="823420" d="3250">And I don’t think the rules that apply to
systems also apply to meta-systems.</p>
<p t="826670" d="4610">But you know, that could just be me.</p>
<p t="831280" d="2700">So you’re going to have to decide that for
yourself.</p>
<p t="833980" d="5979">But I think the reason that I can make that
claim, and that it’s a valid claim is because</p>
<p t="839959" d="2841">first of all, I don’t believe that it’s
an intellectual system.</p>
<p t="842800" d="5180">I don’t think it’s an attempt to reduce
a complex set of phenomena to something that</p>
<p t="847980" d="10120">is… dispenses with important elements of
their existence.</p>
<p t="858100" d="3820">So for example, let me give you an example
of how that sort of thing happens.</p>
<p t="861920" d="4930">If you’re looking at the world through a
biased lens, what it means is that you take</p>
<p t="866850" d="2760">non-random samples of the environmental data.</p>
<p t="869610" d="7110">So I can give you a quick example of something
I saw that I thought was very particular in</p>
<p t="876720" d="1000">that regard.</p>
<p t="877720" d="5109">I don’t think I’ve used this example before,
but about ten years ago or thereabouts Naomi</p>
<p t="882829" d="4351">Klein made this documentary about this factory
down in South America.</p>
<p t="887180" d="2020">I believe it was in Argentina.</p>
<p t="889200" d="6290">And this was just after all the foreign capital
fled out of Argentina and the economy collapsed</p>
<p t="895490" d="4390">completely, which is something that happens
to Argentina fairly regularly, by the way.</p>
<p t="899880" d="4690">And she went down there to this factory where
there were working men and they had been building</p>
<p t="904570" d="1000">heavy machinery.</p>
<p t="905570" d="3940">And the working men had decided that they
were going to… the factory had been padlocked</p>
<p t="909510" d="3560">and they had been locked out because things
had come to a halt.</p>
<p t="913070" d="3569">And they had decided that they were going
to take a chainsaw to the factory gate and</p>
<p t="916639" d="2361">go in there and start making heavy machinery
again.</p>
<p t="919000" d="4029">And you know, it was a very cool documentary
as far as I was concerned.</p>
<p t="923029" d="3281">She went down there and she interviewed all
these working guys and they talked about how</p>
<p t="926310" d="3240">their lives had been brought to a halt by
the factory closure.</p>
<p t="929550" d="4560">And obviously it sucked that they were sitting
around doing nothing and not being paid for</p>
<p t="934110" d="3881">doing anything when they could’ve been inside
the factory building heavy machinery, which</p>
<p t="937991" d="1869">is what they wanted to do.</p>
<p t="939860" d="4880">So she went down there and laid out their
story and it was very sympathetic to the workers</p>
<p t="944740" d="3080">and good, you know, fair enough, good.</p>
<p t="947820" d="3860">But then she went and interviewed the guy
who owned the factory and she didn’t ask</p>
<p t="951680" d="2300">him any real questions.</p>
<p t="953980" d="7180">What she did instead was caricaturize him,
even a priori, you know, as sort of a fascist</p>
<p t="961160" d="10600">capitalist, sort of like the millionaire in
Monopoly, and never tried to get beneath the</p>
<p t="971760" d="5699">superficial a priori categorisation to find
out what he actually thought.</p>
<p t="977459" d="3791">And I was just waiting, I thought, well this
is cool, what the hell does the factory owner</p>
<p t="981250" d="1000">have to say?</p>
<p t="982250" d="3810">It’s like, where did his money go, why does
he think he has a right to the factory, like</p>
<p t="986060" d="1330">what are his conditions of ownership?</p>
<p t="987390" d="1220">Did he earn the money?</p>
<p t="988610" d="1600">Did he inherit it?</p>
<p t="990210" d="5020">It’s like, what does he think about the
fact that Argentina’s economy has collapsed?</p>
<p t="995230" d="2750">How does he feel about the fact that all these
workers are out of work?</p>
<p t="997980" d="2710">What does he think about the fact that they
opened up the factory again?</p>
<p t="1000690" d="3329">Like, there’s a lot of interesting things
to ask this guy.</p>
<p t="1004019" d="2611">None of it, none of it happened.</p>
<p t="1006630" d="4550">And so, to me what happened was that she was
someone with neglect.</p>
<p t="1011180" d="4050">You know, she was looking at the world but
she could only see half of everything.</p>
<p t="1015230" d="9309">And the half she saw was probably perfectly
justifiable, had its proper domain of application,</p>
<p t="1024539" d="5250">but the half she missed, well, what about
that part of the story?</p>
<p t="1029789" d="5900">You’re going to reduce that to cliché and
stereotype and expand up the rest of the story?</p>
<p t="1035689" d="3480">Well, the only reason you’d do that is if
you didn’t want to find out what the hell</p>
<p t="1039169" d="1000">was going on.</p>
<p t="1040169" d="5150">If all you wanted to do was gather evidence
that would support your initial theory.</p>
<p t="1045319" d="6261">Now, I know perfectly well that there’s
plenty of situations where workers, the conditions</p>
<p t="1051580" d="1839">of workers are absolutely abysmal.</p>
<p t="1053419" d="5120">I mean, one of the books I’ve read that
I think a remarkable documentation of that</p>
<p t="1058539" d="4711">is a book by George Orwell called ‘Road
to Wigan Pier’, which is a study of the</p>
<p t="1063250" d="4239">conditions that coal miners lived in in the
1930s in Britain.</p>
<p t="1067489" d="1940">And you know, it’s bloody dismal.</p>
<p t="1069429" d="8340">And the idea that they were exploited, well,
that’s a tougher one, because the Industrial</p>
<p t="1077769" d="6051">Revolution was very, very hard on people,
and it was really, really hard on some people.</p>
<p t="1083820" d="2250">You know, particularly on some people.</p>
<p t="1086070" d="6109">Whether that was because of exploitation or
because of the existence of absolute poverty</p>
<p t="1092179" d="1960">is not all that obvious.</p>
<p t="1094139" d="4010">And you know… so it’s a complicated issue.</p>
<p t="1098149" d="6120">Now there’s lots of times when workers were
clearly exploited, but I think there are times</p>
<p t="1104269" d="1380">as well when they weren’t.</p>
<p t="1105649" d="5730">Anyways, it’s a great book, and he does
a lovely job of laying out a rationale for</p>
<p t="1111379" d="5391">why the workers should be treated far better
than they were treated, and you know, so fine,</p>
<p t="1116770" d="1860">good, wonderful.</p>
<p t="1118630" d="2590">There’s something to be said.</p>
<p t="1121220" d="5139">But the thing is when you want to say something,
you want to take an unbiased sample if you</p>
<p t="1126359" d="5070">can, and so this is why I like this particular
mode of conceptualisation, and I think it’s…</p>
<p t="1131429" d="5141">the reason I think it’s not an intellectual
construction is because I think it emerges</p>
<p t="1136570" d="4349">naturally out of the structure of mythology
and narrative, and you can think this through</p>
<p t="1140919" d="6850">yourself, but as far I’ve been able to tell,
narratives present themselves in terms of</p>
<p t="1147769" d="2081">archetypal characters.</p>
<p t="1149850" d="4939">And the thing about a comprehensive narrative
is it can’t leave out an archetypal character,</p>
<p t="1154789" d="1151">or it fails.</p>
<p t="1155940" d="3140">Now I can give you an example of this.</p>
<p t="1159080" d="4929">So how many of you have seen Disney’s ‘Sleeping
Beauty’?</p>
<p t="1164009" d="1711">Okay, so many of you have.</p>
<p t="1165720" d="1049">How many haven’t?</p>
<p t="1166769" d="2451">Okay, so there’s a few that haven’t.</p>
<p t="1169220" d="3360">Well the Disney movies, you know they’re
kind of standard childhood fare.</p>
<p t="1172580" d="5060">You know, in Sleeping Beauty, what happens
is the King and Queen give birth to a princess</p>
<p t="1177640" d="2840">after trying for a substantial amount of time.</p>
<p t="1180480" d="4159">And she arrives healthy and beautiful, and
then they have a christening day and they</p>
<p t="1184639" d="1311">invite everybody to it.</p>
<p t="1185950" d="5849">But they don’t invite Maleficent, who’s
a dark witch, roughly speaking.</p>
<p t="1191799" d="4260">You know, she’s Queen of the Underworld,
for lack of a better word.</p>
<p t="1196059" d="3180">She’s the negative element of femininity.</p>
<p t="1199239" d="2410">And they don’t invite her to the party.</p>
<p t="1201649" d="6080">And so she shows up anyways, and says that
because they didn’t invite her, their daughter’s</p>
<p t="1207729" d="6461">going to die when she hits sixteen, which
is roughly the age of let’s say sexual maturation</p>
<p t="1214190" d="1599">for a story of that sort.</p>
<p t="1215789" d="9980">Now there’s another little positive magic
female in the story, who mitigates that death</p>
<p t="1225769" d="4090">sentence to protracted sleep.</p>
<p t="1229859" d="4791">Well the idea behind it, it’s a very, very
interesting story, it’s an Oedipal story</p>
<p t="1234650" d="6119">in a sense, because what it says is that if
you’re parents protect you too much from</p>
<p t="1240769" d="6191">the dark side of life when you’re young,
what will happen when you start on the road</p>
<p t="1246960" d="5899">to maturity is you’ll be so naïve and so
fragile that you’ll want to be unconscious</p>
<p t="1252859" d="2111">instead of paying attention.</p>
<p t="1254970" d="3740">And that you’re going to have to be rescued
from that state by something.</p>
<p t="1258710" d="6169">And it could be a prince, which is how the
story lays itself out, or it also could be</p>
<p t="1264879" d="4300">the symbolically masculine and exploratory
element of your own psyche.</p>
<p t="1269179" d="4911">And the story’s ambivalent about whether
it’s an external event or an internal event,</p>
<p t="1274090" d="2150">it doesn’t really matter.</p>
<p t="1276240" d="1700">The things end up being the same.</p>
<p t="1277940" d="3739">And so that’s actually what happens in this
Sleeping Beauty story.</p>
<p t="1281679" d="6250">You know, at the end, a prince, who’s also
enslaved by this terrible negative feminine</p>
<p t="1287929" d="7600">force, manages to escape, and Maleficent turns
into a dragon and then he has to fight her,</p>
<p t="1295529" d="1450">and then he goes and rescues the princess.</p>
<p t="1296979" d="2950">And she wakes up and the kingdoms rejuvenate
and everybody’s happy.</p>
<p t="1299929" d="1700">It’s a classic, classic story.</p>
<p t="1301629" d="7591">And it’s not… it’s funny because the
Disney movie Frozen was put forward as a,</p>
<p t="1309220" d="4189">in some sense as a feminist alternative to
the classic fairy tales, but first of all</p>
<p t="1313409" d="3091">you can’t do that, you can’t just generate
up a fairy tale.</p>
<p t="1316500" d="4320">You know, there’s recent evidence that some
of these fairy tales, the ones that the Grimm</p>
<p t="1320820" d="5699">brothers and Hans Christian Andersen collected,
are up to ten thousand years old.</p>
<p t="1326519" d="2451">You can’t just come up with a counter-fairy
tale.</p>
<p t="1328970" d="3019">That’s just not how it works.</p>
<p t="1331989" d="6841">And the way that a fairy tale is structured,
it has nothing to do with the necessity for</p>
<p t="1338830" d="2699">anyone to rely on anyone else for anything.</p>
<p t="1341529" d="6471">It’s a complex portrayal of the dynamic
relationship between archetypal characters,</p>
<p t="1348000" d="2580">and you know, it’s one form of the story.</p>
<p t="1350580" d="3190">There’s lots of different forms of the story.</p>
<p t="1353770" d="3409">But what I like about Sleeping Beauty for
example, and this is what’s nice about the</p>
<p t="1357179" d="5141">real fairy tales, is that along with the positive
there’s negative, and it’s real negative.</p>
<p t="1362320" d="1689">Like real fairy tales are terrifying.</p>
<p t="1364009" d="2380">I don’t… who is it?</p>
<p t="1366389" d="2390">Is it in Sleeping Beauty?</p>
<p t="1368779" d="1000">Or Snow White?</p>
<p t="1369779" d="1000">I don’t remember.</p>
<p t="1370779" d="4370">In one of the famous Grimm fairy tales, one
of the evil sisters ends up dancing in red</p>
<p t="1375149" d="2211">hot shoes till she dies.</p>
<p t="1377360" d="5350">You know, it’s… they’re very, very violent
and unsettling.</p>
<p t="1382710" d="2919">And it’s because they have the quality of
genuine folk tales.</p>
<p t="1385629" d="2410">But the reason for that is because they’re
dealing with real things.</p>
<p t="1388039" d="3740">Like the Hansel and Gretel’s story is a
good example of that, right?</p>
<p t="1391779" d="1830">Kids are abandoned out in the woods.</p>
<p t="1393609" d="2910">They find something that’s too good to be
true.</p>
<p t="1396519" d="3030">Inside this thing that’s too good to be
true is something that wants to fatten them</p>
<p t="1399549" d="1010">up and devour them.</p>
<p t="1400559" d="2500">It’s a rough story.</p>
<p t="1403059" d="5990">But what it’s doing… the stories have
evolved to represent the fundamental dynamic</p>
<p t="1409049" d="7200">elements of existence, if you conceptualise
existence in terms of character.</p>
<p t="1416249" d="4900">And the thing is you have to conceptualise
existence in terms of character if you’re</p>
<p t="1421149" d="4350">a person, because what you do in existence
is act out your character.</p>
<p t="1425499" d="3441">So your character is an element of existence.</p>
<p t="1428940" d="3949">Now, you might say well that doesn’t mean
that society has a character.</p>
<p t="1432889" d="2410">But actually, it does mean that.</p>
<p t="1435299" d="5031">Because partly what happens… like if you’re
socialised, say, into a culture.</p>
<p t="1440330" d="4760">The culture exists in the same relationship
to you, roughly speaking, as another person</p>
<p t="1445090" d="1100">does.</p>
<p t="1446190" d="5069">So for example, if you put money in the bank,
which is in principle a representation of</p>
<p t="1451259" d="4800">your labour, what you’re doing is entering
into a contract with the broader social world,</p>
<p t="1456059" d="8410">which is one of promise, essentially, where
the future society promises to return your</p>
<p t="1464469" d="1840">value at a future date.</p>
<p t="1466309" d="1891">So it’s a contractual relationship.</p>
<p t="1468200" d="5839">And the reason that God the Father is a very
common representation is because treating</p>
<p t="1474039" d="7230">the ‘they’, in Heidegerrian terms, the
others, in Heideggerian terms, as if they’re</p>
<p t="1481269" d="3691">an embodied entity, actually works.</p>
<p t="1484960" d="6880">So it’s because it is an emergent property
of all of the personalities that make it up.</p>
<p t="1491840" d="4689">And so you’re interacting with that emergent
personality all the time.</p>
<p t="1496529" d="3880">You could even say for example, that that’s
the Freudian Id.</p>
<p t="1500409" d="5120">It’s the thing that… the representation
of that inside you is what makes you feel</p>
<p t="1505529" d="3821">guilty when you transgress against certain
moral rules.</p>
<p t="1509350" d="4799">And you might say, along with the radical
existentialists, that that’s just arbitrary</p>
<p t="1514149" d="4731">and that you can create your own values, but
it’s not just arbitrary.</p>
<p t="1518880" d="4450">Because it’s dependent on the consent of
others, as well as on some internal harmony</p>
<p t="1523330" d="1000">or disharmony.</p>
<p t="1524330" d="1490">It’s not arbitrary.</p>
<p t="1525820" d="4709">And you can’t just set that up by yourself.</p>
<p t="1530529" d="6000">So these things are realities and they’re
deep realities.</p>
<p t="1536529" d="4791">Now, this particular portrayal indicates a
kind of balance.</p>
<p t="1541320" d="6140">So the fundamental ground of reality is neither
positive nor negative, it’s the ground out</p>
<p t="1547460" d="2980">of which everything positive or negative emerges.</p>
<p t="1550440" d="5849">So you might think of the fundamental ground
of reality as that which exists prior to your</p>
<p t="1556289" d="1220">encounter with it.</p>
<p t="1557509" d="2130">And we have no idea what that is.</p>
<p t="1559639" d="8740">Now you can think about it as… people tend
to think about what things are made of in</p>
<p t="1568379" d="5441">atomic terms but it’s not a particularly
comprehensive way of thinking about it.</p>
<p t="1573820" d="8849">Because what exists beyond the realm of your
comprehension is the patterned relationship</p>
<p t="1582669" d="2860">between everything and everything.</p>
<p t="1585529" d="5181">And you can’t reduce it to any simple level
of analysis because you miss all sorts of</p>
<p t="1590710" d="3250">elements of it that are extraordinarily important
if you do that.</p>
<p t="1593960" d="5179">So you can’t do that, that’s not what
experience is made out of, or what the grounded</p>
<p t="1599139" d="1750">experience is made out of.</p>
<p t="1600889" d="3011">And so it’s neutral in some sense.</p>
<p t="1603900" d="2869">Because it exists beyond your encounter with
it.</p>
<p t="1606769" d="2241">It’s the unknown as such.</p>
<p t="1609010" d="5509">And the reason that that’s often represented
in the form of a predatory lizard that has</p>
<p t="1614519" d="3790">something to offer is precisely because of
that.</p>
<p t="1618309" d="4831">The absolute unknown has the capacity to tear
you into pieces and burn you up, but it also</p>
<p t="1623140" d="5339">has the possibility of rewarding you with
everything you could possibly be rewarded</p>
<p t="1628479" d="1000">with.</p>
<p t="1629479" d="2971">So it’s this strange juxtaposition of potential.</p>
<p t="1632450" d="4189">I like to think about it as potential, you
know, because people can get a grip on what</p>
<p t="1636639" d="1610">potential means.</p>
<p t="1638249" d="3650">There’s potential everywhere, whatever that
is.</p>
<p t="1641899" d="3120">You have potential, your parents tell you
that all the time.</p>
<p t="1645019" d="1000">What is that?</p>
<p t="1646019" d="3640">Well, it’s the unrealised stuff of your
being.</p>
<p t="1649659" d="6520">Now it’s a very strange concept, potential,
because you can’t characterise it any way</p>
<p t="1656179" d="2360">that you would characterise something that’s
real.</p>
<p t="1658539" d="2680">Because it’s not real, it’s potential.</p>
<p t="1661219" d="1540">But you act like it’s real.</p>
<p t="1662759" d="3280">You know, you’ll feel guilty that you’re
not living up to your potential, you’re</p>
<p t="1666039" d="1480">not manifesting your potential.</p>
<p t="1667519" d="5490">You want people to interact with you so that
they allow you to demonstrate your potential.</p>
<p t="1673009" d="3681">You act as if it’s a reality continually.</p>
<p t="1676690" d="2910">You think as if it’s a reality continually.</p>
<p t="1679600" d="3919">You ask if your relationship has potential,
you know.</p>
<p t="1683519" d="5350">But it’s a very, very strange substance,
whatever this potential is.</p>
<p t="1688869" d="5900">It’s unrealised possibility, essentially,
but you regard it as something that’s fluid</p>
<p t="1694769" d="6431">and something that can develop in all sorts
of different directions, and something whose</p>
<p t="1701200" d="2059">development you can shape.</p>
<p t="1703259" d="2090">Because otherwise why would you feel guilty,
you know?</p>
<p t="1705349" d="5601">It’s like, if you’re doing the wrong thing,
you’re realising some potential in the wrong</p>
<p t="1710950" d="2649">way, and then you feel bad about that.</p>
<p t="1713599" d="5710">It’s like, well, there’s some sense of
intrinsic morality operating at the bottom</p>
<p t="1719309" d="1000">of that.</p>
<p t="1720309" d="1000">We’ve talked a lot about that.</p>
<p t="1721309" d="5571">Some of that’s built in biologically, some
of it is structured culturally, some of it</p>
<p t="1726880" d="8609">is a consequence of you trying to organise
your… this plethora of semi-beings that</p>
<p t="1735489" d="1570">you are into some integrated manner.</p>
<p t="1737059" d="2590">Like it’s a very, very complicated thing.</p>
<p t="1739649" d="1961">It’s not just arbitrary.</p>
<p t="1741610" d="5009">Okay so that’s the very background, the
dragon of chaos, positive and negative.</p>
<p t="1746619" d="3690">And it’s the thing out of which everything
springs.</p>
<p t="1750309" d="6521">If you look at the Scandinavian world tree,
for example, or world trees in general, you</p>
<p t="1756830" d="4849">very frequently have a representation of a
serpent that’s associated with them.</p>
<p t="1761679" d="8021">The reason that the… that potential is serpentine
is extraordinarily complicated, but I think</p>
<p t="1769700" d="6289">it’s partly because, say snakes shed their
own skin, so they can be reborn, so they’re</p>
<p t="1775989" d="1630">a symbol of transformation.</p>
<p t="1777619" d="4611">And then they’re sneaky and subtle and so
they appear in places that you wouldn’t</p>
<p t="1782230" d="5049">necessarily expect them to, and then they’re
a terrible, terrible threat.</p>
<p t="1787279" d="2640">In overcoming that threat, you also develop.</p>
<p t="1789919" d="4470">So not only are they a threat, but they’re
the kind of threat that makes you become strong</p>
<p t="1794389" d="1530">when you face it.</p>
<p t="1795919" d="5560">And that’s partly why the snake is such
an ambivalent figure in most mythology.</p>
<p t="1801479" d="6430">Okay, so that’s complicated, but we’ll
return to that later.</p>
<p t="1807909" d="6200">And then out of that, you might say, emerges
the unknown as you encounter it.</p>
<p t="1814109" d="6410">So there’s potential itself, and then the
first layer of potential are the things that</p>
<p t="1820519" d="2691">you encounter that you don’t understand.</p>
<p t="1823210" d="2020">So I can give you an example of that.</p>
<p t="1825230" d="3559">So let’s say you’re a three-year-old,
or a two-year-old, that’s better, and you’re</p>
<p t="1828789" d="2870">in the kitchen and a mouse runs across the
room.</p>
<p t="1831659" d="4760">And so you track it because your eyes pick
up the movement, and you track the thing.</p>
<p t="1836419" d="4600">And then it’s an unexpected occurrence,
so you don’t know what it signifies, right.</p>
<p t="1841019" d="5650">So that’s the emergence of something tangibly
unknown into your conceptual space.</p>
<p t="1846669" d="4140">Now it’s not like you lack any knowledge
of it.</p>
<p t="1850809" d="6360">You can tell what its size is, and you can
get some estimation of its speed.</p>
<p t="1857169" d="4470">And I think what you have to do when you think
about whether or not something is unknown</p>
<p t="1861639" d="5100">is you have to think about it in relationship
to that hierarchy of perception that I keep</p>
<p t="1866739" d="1400">throwing at you.</p>
<p t="1868139" d="9260">You know, if something emerges… if you encounter
an entity and you can map it at every single</p>
<p t="1877399" d="3350">level of your value hierarchy, then it’s
known.</p>
<p t="1880749" d="8210">You know how to interact with it at a micro-level,
and you know what its implications are for</p>
<p t="1888959" d="3330">every other level of your conceptual being.</p>
<p t="1892289" d="1990">You know what its implications are for the
future.</p>
<p t="1894279" d="3580">Like you know exactly how to deal with that
thing, it’s mapped at every single level.</p>
<p t="1897859" d="3940">There’s other things that are only mapped
at one level and not at others.</p>
<p t="1901799" d="4901">So maybe the mouse, we’ll say, for the child
who’s never seen a mouse, it’s like…</p>
<p t="1906700" d="5429">it shares some commonalities with objects
that the child is familiar with.</p>
<p t="1912129" d="5230">But there’s sufficient novelty so that it’s
also contaminated with the unknown, and that</p>
<p t="1917359" d="4800">makes the child, basically, semi-startled
and alert.</p>
<p t="1922159" d="5931">Now the child will immediately refer to an
adult, and it’s a technical term, actually,</p>
<p t="1928090" d="7129">they’ll look at the adult’s face because
the adult broadcasts the motivational affective</p>
<p t="1935219" d="1630">significance of that event.</p>
<p t="1936849" d="6341">And so the child looks, references, and then
reads off the face (and of course the speech</p>
<p t="1943190" d="4359">and the bodily actions) exactly what that
thing signifies.</p>
<p t="1947549" d="4141">And then if the person that they’re looking
at jumps up on the table and screams, then</p>
<p t="1951690" d="4529">that’s one sense of meaning, which is ‘God,
this thing is magical, it’s only this big</p>
<p t="1956219" d="5900">and look at what effect it has on, you know,
my aunt (for the sake of argument), who’s</p>
<p t="1962119" d="4340">you know, a pretty competent creature as far
as I can tell, being two years old’.</p>
<p t="1966459" d="4820">And then if she just dismisses it, you know,
her actions are going to determine the meaning</p>
<p t="1971279" d="2140">of that phenomenon.</p>
<p t="1973419" d="7430">So that’s how the transformation of the
semi-known thing into the more-known thing</p>
<p t="1980849" d="1000">occurs.</p>
<p t="1981849" d="2981">It occurs almost always in a social context.</p>
<p t="1984830" d="3889">You can explore things by yourself, but you
rarely actually do that by yourself.</p>
<p t="1988719" d="5500">It’s almost always you plugged into a social
apparatus, you know.</p>
<p t="1994219" d="5070">So you might be doing the specific investigating,
but the social apparatus is around you so</p>
<p t="1999289" d="5571">that you can confer with it, and it also shapes
the way that you’re going to interact with</p>
<p t="2004860" d="1679">that specific thing.</p>
<p t="2006539" d="10781">Okay, so the unknown, that’s generally…
the unknown that you encounter, that’s generally</p>
<p t="2017320" d="3669">characterised using feminine symbolism.</p>
<p t="2020989" d="3861">And I think the reason for that, there’s
a bunch of reasons, and we talked about many</p>
<p t="2024850" d="1929">of them.</p>
<p t="2026779" d="4510">One reason is because females do the sexual
selection in human beings, and so they act</p>
<p t="2031289" d="1190">as the face of nature.</p>
<p t="2032479" d="7091">Another reason is that you can think of new
possibility always emerging out of the non-cultural</p>
<p t="2039570" d="1949">background, in some sense.</p>
<p t="2041519" d="6991">So for example, let’s say that we send an
expedition to Mars, and we’re gathering</p>
<p t="2048510" d="1529">new information as a consequence.</p>
<p t="2050039" d="4171">The reason we’re gathering new information
is because we’ve gone out past the domain</p>
<p t="2054210" d="3919">of our knowledge, in a sense, and we’re
interacting with something new.</p>
<p t="2058129" d="3901">And in that interaction, new information is
generated.</p>
<p t="2062030" d="4730">Now you can say that it’s partly the act
of the perceiver that’s generating the new</p>
<p t="2066760" d="3440">information, and you can say that it’s partly
the act of the culture.</p>
<p t="2070200" d="4679">Because we sent robots to Mars, let’s say,
which is very, very difficult.</p>
<p t="2074879" d="5171">So the culture goes there but the individuals
are observing, so the individuals are buttressed</p>
<p t="2080050" d="1000">by the culture.</p>
<p t="2081050" d="3879">But they’re generating information because
they’re somewhere truly new.</p>
<p t="2084929" d="4781">And so the information… the unknown is a
constant source of new information.</p>
<p t="2089710" d="2949">So it’s a place that gives birth to new
information.</p>
<p t="2092659" d="4061">And so that’s another part of the reason
that it seems to be symbolised in feminine</p>
<p t="2096720" d="1000">form.</p>
<p t="2097720" d="5020">You know, I’m just taking this, in some
sense, as an empirical fact.</p>
<p t="2102740" d="4920">I’ve looked at… it looks like that’s
how these stories work.</p>
<p t="2107660" d="3770">And so I’ve been trying to puzzle out why
exactly that would be the case.</p>
<p t="2111430" d="5390">I also think it’s the case that we tend
to look at the world from a social cognitive</p>
<p t="2116820" d="1400">perspective.</p>
<p t="2118220" d="4550">We filter it through a social, cognitive,
biological apparatus.</p>
<p t="2122770" d="6329">And so we’re very likely to see things in
character form, and characters have sexes,</p>
<p t="2129099" d="2000">and so that’s going to happen.</p>
<p t="2131099" d="5470">And then which, the attributes of femininity
or the attributes of masculinity, that get</p>
<p t="2136569" d="5231">used as symbolic reference in some sense,
there’s an arbitrariness involved.</p>
<p t="2141800" d="5400">So for example, for the Egyptians… you know,
usually have a sky god, but they had a sky</p>
<p t="2147200" d="1000">goddess.</p>
<p t="2148200" d="3760">Now, she usually represents the night sky,
which is not exactly the same thing as the</p>
<p t="2151960" d="6130">day sky, but you have to... it’s so tricky
because you have to look at the relationships</p>
<p t="2158090" d="4140">between the characters in order to decide
what all of them mean, and that shifts a little</p>
<p t="2162230" d="1789">bit from story to story.</p>
<p t="2164019" d="5540">So this is a, what would you say, it’s an
approximation of the underlying structure,</p>
<p t="2169559" d="6621">but there’s a fair bit of variation in it,
just like there’s variance in stories.</p>
<p t="2176180" d="4620">Well the feminine element has a destructive
element and a creative aspect.</p>
<p t="2180800" d="6469">And you can see that people characterise their
environments in that way.</p>
<p t="2187269" d="5881">So for example, you can map on environmental
beliefs onto this structure.</p>
<p t="2193150" d="8969">You can say that the environmentalist portrays
nature as positive, portrays culture as negative,</p>
<p t="2202119" d="1710">and portrays the individual as negative.</p>
<p t="2203829" d="8821">And the basic story is rampaging individual
as member of rapacious culture invading the</p>
<p t="2212650" d="4090">pristine landscape of beautiful Mother Nature.</p>
<p t="2216740" d="3610">Now the thing about that story is it’s true.</p>
<p t="2220350" d="3730">The problem with that story is that it’s
half true.</p>
<p t="2224080" d="4550">So for example, one thing that’s interesting
to conceptualise is that that’s exactly</p>
<p t="2228630" d="2880">the opposite of the frontier myth.</p>
<p t="2231510" d="5819">Now the frontier myth was a story that was
used extensively in Europe to drive immigration</p>
<p t="2237329" d="1000">into the United States.</p>
<p t="2238329" d="1771">And it was used to some degree in Canada too.</p>
<p t="2240100" d="2870">And so the story was the exact opposite.</p>
<p t="2242970" d="6109">It’s the hero, so that would be the immigrant
pioneer, bringing the benefits of order to</p>
<p t="2249079" d="1540">a savage wilderness.</p>
<p t="2250619" d="6391">Well that’s also true, but it’s so interesting
that both of those things can be true, and</p>
<p t="2257010" d="2690">they’re completely different from one another.</p>
<p t="2259700" d="5060">There’s no commonality at all between those
two stories, except for the way that they</p>
<p t="2264760" d="1160">use the characters.</p>
<p t="2265920" d="5000">There’s a feminine character, a masculine
character (that represents culture), and then</p>
<p t="2270920" d="2770">there’s another character that represents
the individual.</p>
<p t="2273690" d="4810">And you could even see that, if you think
about it historically, the US was founded</p>
<p t="2278500" d="4250">in some sense on the frontier myth, and that
was to one side.</p>
<p t="2282750" d="5810">And so by the time the 1960s came along, the
early 1960s, it shifted to its opposite.</p>
<p t="2288560" d="7340">And you need that, because systems have to
oscillate to some degree to remain stable</p>
<p t="2295900" d="1000">across time.</p>
<p t="2296900" d="1639">They can’t just be fixed in place.</p>
<p t="2298539" d="4341">So they’re going to play back and forth
through the archetypes in an attempt to keep</p>
<p t="2302880" d="3600">them balanced because that’s what you’re
trying to do, you’re trying to keep them</p>
<p t="2306480" d="2080">balanced.</p>
<p t="2308560" d="3989">And so, you have the destructive and creative
element of Mother Nature.</p>
<p t="2312549" d="8020">You see that all the time in movies where
the thing that the hero is striving against</p>
<p t="2320569" d="2671">is the negative element of the unknown.</p>
<p t="2323240" d="2299">How many of you have seen the movie ‘Alien’?</p>
<p t="2325539" d="6221">Okay so that’s a pretty graphic representation
of, well those aliens were more reptilian</p>
<p t="2331760" d="7589">in form, so they’re almost like… they’re
more at the dragon of chaos level of civilisation,</p>
<p t="2339349" d="6141">but they’re a terrible external force that’s
threatening human culture and the individual.</p>
<p t="2345490" d="4920">It’s exactly the opposite story that’s
played out in… what was the movie with all</p>
<p t="2350410" d="1410">the blue creatures?</p>
<p t="2351820" d="2130">Avatar, right.</p>
<p t="2353950" d="6770">Avatar is exactly the opposite of that, where
you know, the unknown nature is just nothing</p>
<p t="2360720" d="3290">but sweetness and bliss.</p>
<p t="2364010" d="6730">And the culture is portrayed as spear-headed
by greedy and rapacious individuals who are</p>
<p t="2370740" d="3220">basically manifestations of the military industrial
complex.</p>
<p t="2373960" d="3440">The funny thing is that those both made good
stories.</p>
<p t="2377400" d="6169">And that’s because… well, it’s because
they have enough archetypal truth so that</p>
<p t="2383569" d="3951">there’s many situations that they’re relevant
to.</p>
<p t="2387520" d="5180">You know, sometimes Mother Nature is your
best friend, and sometimes it’s your worst</p>
<p t="2392700" d="1000">enemy.</p>
<p t="2393700" d="6060">And so you could go down to the jungles of
Peru, and you could talk to the people who</p>
<p t="2399760" d="5700">live there, and you could find out what they
know about medicinal plants in the jungle,</p>
<p t="2405460" d="3270">and you could bring home things to cure disease.</p>
<p t="2408730" d="3950">Or you could just go down there and get lost
in the jungle and then you’re dead.</p>
<p t="2412680" d="4220">You know in some sense it’s the same jungle.</p>
<p t="2416900" d="5280">And whether it’s positive or negative depends
on what stance you take towards it and how</p>
<p t="2422180" d="1540">you behave.</p>
<p t="2423720" d="4670">And so the other thing that’s really interesting
about mythology, and this is the lovely element</p>
<p t="2428390" d="4929">of mythology, is that part of what it does
is tell you how to take this incredibly complex</p>
<p t="2433319" d="5941">landscape that’s positive and negative at
the same time, at every level of analysis,</p>
<p t="2439260" d="8589">and how to navigate through it so that the
proper balance is maintained as far as the</p>
<p t="2447849" d="5190">entire system is concerned.</p>
<p t="2453039" d="4050">So the culture has an orderly element, and
that’s what protects us here, and it has</p>
<p t="2457089" d="4081">a tyrannical element, and that’s what makes
you treated like numbers at the University</p>
<p t="2461170" d="1000">of Toronto.</p>
<p t="2462170" d="2949">You know, you get both of those at exactly
the same time.</p>
<p t="2465119" d="4381">And then the archetypal individual has the
same fundamental nature.</p>
<p t="2469500" d="2089">Hero or villain.</p>
<p t="2471589" d="4941">And you know those have archetypal roots,
because the ultimate hero is the ultimate,</p>
<p t="2476530" d="1000">perfect person.</p>
<p t="2477530" d="6270">And the ultimate villain is Satan himself,
in whatever form he happens to take.</p>
<p t="2483800" d="8509">It doesn’t take much knowledge of the structure
before you can see it manifested all over,</p>
<p t="2492309" d="4851">especially in movies that are particularly
popular, because they almost always have a</p>
<p t="2497160" d="1000">central archetypal theme.</p>
<p t="2498160" d="3540">The Marvel superhero movies are a really good
example of that.</p>
<p t="2501700" d="5860">And if it’s complex literature, the archetypes
are mixed to some degree.</p>
<p t="2507560" d="5700">So you have a hero who’s not only a hero,
you have a hero who has all sorts of flaws.</p>
<p t="2513260" d="4829">And he’s in a culture, or she’s in a culture,
that has positive elements and negative elements</p>
<p t="2518089" d="4651">and they’re in a broader landscape that’s
characterised by exactly the same thing.</p>
<p t="2522740" d="2420">So it’s nuanced.</p>
<p t="2525160" d="3470">And the more sophisticated you get, the more
you can tolerate that kind of nuance.</p>
<p t="2528630" d="4469">And I think that’s also one of the things…
that’s partly why literature is such a good</p>
<p t="2533099" d="2270">antidote to ideology.</p>
<p t="2535369" d="5791">Because the more sophisticated the literature
becomes, the more complex, and fragmented</p>
<p t="2541160" d="6649">in some sense, or differentiated, the more
differentiated the archetypal landscape becomes.</p>
<p t="2547809" d="5081">So when someone tells you a story, whatever
the story happens to be, one of the things</p>
<p t="2552890" d="3810">you can do when you know the substructures,
is you can say ‘okay yeah, but where are</p>
<p t="2556700" d="2160">the missing pieces?</p>
<p t="2558860" d="1000">Where are they going?’</p>
<p t="2559860" d="3330">Because if they’re not included then they’re
generally projected onto something.</p>
<p t="2563190" d="3599">Because they’re there, you can’t get away
from them, they’re there.</p>
<p t="2566789" d="3201">How does the person account for them?</p>
<p t="2569990" d="5150">Alright, so now I want to tell you another
story.</p>
<p t="2575140" d="4419">So we talked about the Mesopotamian creation
myth last week, and now I want to tell you</p>
<p t="2579559" d="1581">about the Egyptian myth of sovereignty.</p>
<p t="2581140" d="6629">And so, the first thing I should do is say
that all of the stories that I’m talking</p>
<p t="2587769" d="3350">to you about have all sorts of variance.</p>
<p t="2591119" d="6111">And so, the Egyptian story that I’m going
to describe lasted for thousands and thousands</p>
<p t="2597230" d="3970">of years, and so it isn’t like there was
only one variation of it, there’s all sorts</p>
<p t="2601200" d="3730">of variations of it, and I’m only going
to tell you one of them.</p>
<p t="2604930" d="4589">And that’s a limitation, but that’s just
how it is for the time being.</p>
<p t="2609519" d="5320">So I’m not saying that this is the only
version of this story.</p>
<p t="2614839" d="4171">But it’s a version, and it’s the one I’m
most familiar with, and so I can talk about</p>
<p t="2619010" d="3650">it, hopefully with some utility.</p>
<p t="2622660" d="1859">And it’s a great story.</p>
<p t="2624519" d="3501">When I finally figured out what it meant…
it’s so cool, with some of these stories</p>
<p t="2628020" d="5349">if you crack them, and you’re able to see
what they mean, they’re absolutely overwhelming.</p>
<p t="2633369" d="5861">They’re so bloody brilliant, it’s no wonder
that people regard them as revelatory, you</p>
<p t="2639230" d="5080">know, of divine origin, because they have
such power that it’s almost impossible to</p>
<p t="2644310" d="1759">imagine how that could’ve got there.</p>
<p t="2646069" d="5091">Now, I provide you with the Darwinian explanation
of how that got there, right, because the</p>
<p t="2651160" d="6709">stories are representations of social contracts
and behavioural tendencies that have evolved</p>
<p t="2657869" d="2500">over thousands and thousands of years.</p>
<p t="2660369" d="4761">Because of that, the representation, the story’s
going to have way more information in it than</p>
<p t="2665130" d="2449">a typical story might.</p>
<p t="2667579" d="5991">But I still can understand how these things
burst upon people with the force of revelation.</p>
<p t="2673570" d="4489">One of the things that’s quite interesting
too, if you look at cultures historically,</p>
<p t="2678059" d="5310">is that you usually find that the revelation
of the story… it’s like the energy source</p>
<p t="2683369" d="2111">on which the culture feeds.</p>
<p t="2685480" d="4540">So the story comes first, it has this tremendous
dynamic energy.</p>
<p t="2690020" d="5230">The culture basically uses that energy to
propel itself through time, you know, to give</p>
<p t="2695250" d="1869">itself conviction and force.</p>
<p t="2697119" d="3991">And then at some point the story exhausts
itself, and that would be equivalent, in some</p>
<p t="2701110" d="3470">sense, I suppose, to Nietzsche’s announcement
of the death of God.</p>
<p t="2704580" d="3250">And this has happened many times.</p>
<p t="2707830" d="6930">Alright, so there’s four main characters
in the Egyptian story.</p>
<p t="2714760" d="7079">There’s Osiris, Isis, Set, and Horus.</p>
<p t="2721839" d="5211">Now, Osiris, we’ll start with Osiris, but
you could start with any of the characters,</p>
<p t="2727050" d="4469">because one of the things that’s quite interesting
about mythology is that the myths don’t</p>
<p t="2731519" d="4461">make any distinction between the causal priority
of these characters.</p>
<p t="2735980" d="3520">Any of them can be regarded as fundamental.</p>
<p t="2739500" d="5099">So the hero is the person who separates the
world parents for example, and brings being</p>
<p t="2744599" d="1121">into existence.</p>
<p t="2745720" d="6910">But you can also say well it’s Tiamat, which
is more how the Mesopotamian creation myth</p>
<p t="2752630" d="4800">is tilted, or you can say you can’t make
sense out of anything unless you have a cultural</p>
<p t="2757430" d="2350">lens through which you’re looking.</p>
<p t="2759780" d="5750">Like there has to be some pre-existent structure
before information can be generated in any</p>
<p t="2765530" d="1000">manner.</p>
<p t="2766530" d="3509">So you’re always stuck with this problem,
that in order for something to exist you need</p>
<p t="2770039" d="7050">a substrate, you need an interpretive substructure,
and you need an interpreter.</p>
<p t="2777089" d="3240">And you can’t say that one of those thing
precedes the other.</p>
<p t="2780329" d="2801">They all have to be there at the same time.</p>
<p t="2783130" d="7679">You could say from a Darwinian perspective,
they all emerged and complexified in unison</p>
<p t="2790809" d="3970">as time progressed.</p>
<p t="2794779" d="3731">It doesn’t explain how the origin originated,
however.</p>
<p t="2798510" d="2509">Okay, so you’ve got Osiris.</p>
<p t="2801019" d="4431">Now Osiris is the founder of the Egyptian
state.</p>
<p t="2805450" d="8250">And so, you know, before people wrote things
down, you have to kind of try to understand</p>
<p t="2813700" d="5399">how it was that they remembered things.</p>
<p t="2819099" d="5871">Their memory was more like an amalgam, or
a gist.</p>
<p t="2824970" d="6589">So we already know that if you tell the story
of your actions yesterday that it doesn’t</p>
<p t="2831559" d="3010">take you 16 hours to tell the story.</p>
<p t="2834569" d="3020">Hopefully it takes you like five minutes.</p>
<p t="2837589" d="8411">And why that is is not obvious, but part of
the reason is, for whatever underlying reasons,</p>
<p t="2846000" d="5500">you know what parts of the story are relevant
to other people, and what parts aren’t.</p>
<p t="2851500" d="4730">So basically what you’re going to do is
try not to tell them things they already know.</p>
<p t="2856230" d="1599">Because that would just be pointless.</p>
<p t="2857829" d="4710">And in order to do that you more or less have
to know what they know and what they don’t</p>
<p t="2862539" d="1000">know.</p>
<p t="2863539" d="1300">And you have to more or less stay on the edge
of that.</p>
<p t="2864839" d="1101">But you can do that.</p>
<p t="2865940" d="5710">Well, I might ask you, well what did you do
over the last three months, or I could say</p>
<p t="2871650" d="1469">what have you done for the last couple of
years?</p>
<p t="2873119" d="4720">And in each case you’re going to collapse
that into some representation.</p>
<p t="2877839" d="3851">Now imagine that the problem you’re trying
to solve is ‘what did your culture try to</p>
<p t="2881690" d="3139">do for the last five thousand years?’</p>
<p t="2884829" d="10450">Well imagine that there are… the culture
in part is being continually informed by the</p>
<p t="2895279" d="2310">individuals that compose it.</p>
<p t="2897589" d="5160">And there’re going to be different individuals
of different stature who discover things of</p>
<p t="2902749" d="1320">different importance.</p>
<p t="2904069" d="2480">And we often know some people like that.</p>
<p t="2906549" d="3750">We know of Thomas Edison, for example, and
we can name actual people.</p>
<p t="2910299" d="3551">But that’s in part because we write things
down and have records of them.</p>
<p t="2913850" d="6749">You can imagine though that you’re trying
to represent your history in a way that you</p>
<p t="2920599" d="1000">can remember.</p>
<p t="2921599" d="3811">You’re going to tell stories about people
who have done interesting things, because</p>
<p t="2925410" d="2640">that’s what you even when you tell a story
about yourself.</p>
<p t="2928050" d="4210">So imagine you tell one story about someone
who did something interesting and then you</p>
<p t="2932260" d="3650">tell another story about someone else who
did something interesting, and so forth.</p>
<p t="2935910" d="5869">And that’s continually going on, let’s
say, in a tribal or archaic culture.</p>
<p t="2941779" d="4051">So then what you get is a set of stories about
people doing interesting things.</p>
<p t="2945830" d="6860">Well, it’s easy for that to shift into the
ancestors doing interesting things.</p>
<p t="2952690" d="4840">And then it’s easy for that to shift into
the ancestor doing wonderful things.</p>
<p t="2957530" d="5190">And that’s basically what happens, is that
you get the emergence of the culture story,</p>
<p t="2962720" d="5059">which is something like a small set of cultural
heroes who have done all the things that are</p>
<p t="2967779" d="1101">worth doing.</p>
<p t="2968880" d="3399">And what you’re doing is imitating them.</p>
<p t="2972279" d="8161">And you know, this is… you know, your empirical
memory of events only lasts about a hundred</p>
<p t="2980440" d="1210">years.</p>
<p t="2981650" d="3359">Because there isn’t anyone old enough to
remember anything past that.</p>
<p t="2985009" d="5010">And so what has to happen is that everything
that happened before that has to be collapsed</p>
<p t="2990019" d="5681">into some form that’s memorable, so that
it can be brought forward and taught, and</p>
<p t="2995700" d="2010">that’s the function of these stories.</p>
<p t="2997710" d="5820">These stories actually… it’s almost as
if the story has abandoned everything that</p>
<p t="3003530" d="2770">hasn’t stuck in people’s memories.</p>
<p t="3006300" d="4519">And so all that’s left is the most significant…
is the most significance.</p>
<p t="3010819" d="3011">Because otherwise why would people bother
with it?</p>
<p t="3013830" d="2759">They wouldn’t tell the story, they wouldn’t
be gripped by it.</p>
<p t="3016589" d="3811">Okay, so Osiris, he’s one of these figures.</p>
<p t="3020400" d="4750">You could think… if you allowed people to
tell stories of George Washington, say, and</p>
<p t="3025150" d="4929">Abe Lincoln, and all the semi-mythologised
founders of the United States, if you allowed</p>
<p t="3030079" d="7670">people, in the absence of textbooks and writing,
to tell stories about those men for the next</p>
<p t="3037749" d="5120">thousand years, maybe what you’d get out
of that is an origin story of the mythic founder</p>
<p t="3042869" d="1531">of the state.</p>
<p t="3044400" d="4449">And that seems to be what’s happened in
the Egyptian case with Osiris.</p>
<p t="3048849" d="6220">Now he’s a god, but he’s got human characteristics.</p>
<p t="3055069" d="5690">And so he’s also granted the status of something
that’s eternal.</p>
<p t="3060759" d="4171">Okay now, here’s the story of Osiris, roughly
speaking.</p>
<p t="3064930" d="7000">He’s kind of old now, and he’s a little
bit blind, but he’s blind in a specific</p>
<p t="3071930" d="1000">way.</p>
<p t="3072930" d="4389">And the way that he’s specifically blind
is that he’s wilfully blind.</p>
<p t="3077319" d="5751">Now if you’re wilfully blind about… the
Egyptians say this straightforwardly, and</p>
<p t="3083070" d="1519">I’ll tell you why they believe this.</p>
<p t="3084589" d="4510">If you’re wilfully blind there’s things
that you could know that you take pains not</p>
<p t="3089099" d="1450">to know.</p>
<p t="3090549" d="7030">And wilful blindness, under English common
law, can be grounds for criminal conviction.</p>
<p t="3097579" d="5651">So for example, if you run a company and you
think that your treasurer is cooking the books</p>
<p t="3103230" d="5549">but it’s working to your favour, and you
decide ‘well, I just won’t look’, and</p>
<p t="3108779" d="3551">then later it comes out, you could say ‘well
I didn’t know’, and the people who are</p>
<p t="3112330" d="4300">prosecuting would say ‘yeah but you could
have known and you took a conscious choice</p>
<p t="3116630" d="2979">not to know, so you’re culpable.’</p>
<p t="3119609" d="4390">And I think that’s actually the best model
of Freudian repression, in a sense.</p>
<p t="3123999" d="5501">It isn’t exactly repression, it is failure
to make the effort to know something that</p>
<p t="3129500" d="1650">you could know.</p>
<p t="3131150" d="2330">Now, sometimes you…</p>
<p t="3133480" d="4240">look, sometimes something terrible happens
to you and you just can’t understand it.</p>
<p t="3137720" d="3910">But sometimes something terrible is happening
and you refuse to think about it.</p>
<p t="3141630" d="4940">And because you refuse to think about it you
really don’t know what it is.</p>
<p t="3146570" d="3620">And you might say, ‘well I can’t be culpable
then because I don’t know what it is’,</p>
<p t="3150190" d="3429">but you could have known, so you’re culpable.</p>
<p t="3153619" d="2650">So it’s voluntary ignorance.</p>
<p t="3156269" d="2030">And that’s the problem with Osiris.</p>
<p t="3158299" d="2441">He was a great guy when he was young, he was
a hero.</p>
<p t="3160740" d="2750">He founded the Egyptian state.</p>
<p t="3163490" d="3160">But you know he’s not everything he could
be anymore.</p>
<p t="3166650" d="5449">He’s gotten anachronistic and outdated and
wilfully blind, which is even worse.</p>
<p t="3172099" d="1361">Now there’s an idea here.</p>
<p t="3173460" d="3470">It’s such a bloody brilliant idea, it’s
mindboggling.</p>
<p t="3176930" d="8629">So Osiris is the state manifested in personified
form, and that’s reasonable, because the</p>
<p t="3185559" d="2050">state is like a person.</p>
<p t="3187609" d="8061">The person of the state is manifested in the
body of laws, and you guys all imitate that</p>
<p t="3195670" d="11870">body of laws, and that’s what basically
makes you citizens of the state.</p>
<p t="3207540" d="2069">So that’s what makes you citizens of the
state.</p>
<p t="3209609" d="3581">You can all get along because all of you are
imitating the same thing, and what you’re</p>
<p t="3213190" d="6050">imitating is the central body of custom and
law that makes up the state.</p>
<p t="3219240" d="2180">And that’s why you can predict each other.</p>
<p t="3221420" d="1970">So that makes you a good citizen.</p>
<p t="3223390" d="4780">Now the problem with being a good citizen
is that sometimes if you’re a good citizen</p>
<p t="3228170" d="1460">you’re a bad person.</p>
<p t="3229630" d="1479">That’s a big problem.</p>
<p t="3231109" d="6291">So for example, the better you were at being
a Nazi, in all likelihood, the worse a person</p>
<p t="3237400" d="1130">you were.</p>
<p t="3238530" d="5370">And so that’s a very useful observation,
because one of the things it shows is that</p>
<p t="3243900" d="6429">even though it’s necessary for you to imitate
the central personality of the state, sometimes</p>
<p t="3250329" d="3540">the central personality of the state can be
pathological.</p>
<p t="3253869" d="5950">And the Egyptians, who had established quite
a lengthy state (as opposed, say, to the Mesopotamians…</p>
<p t="3259819" d="6381">the Egyptians had been existing in a complex
state apparatus for a very long period of</p>
<p t="3266200" d="5290">time), they started to encounter problems
that were intrinsic to the state.</p>
<p t="3271490" d="5430">Now you remember, in the Mesopotamian creation
myth, the primary danger was Tiamat.</p>
<p t="3276920" d="4939">You know, you make a lot of racket, you kill
Apsu, that’s order, Tiamat comes flooding</p>
<p t="3281859" d="1131">back and takes you out.</p>
<p t="3282990" d="4160">Well you can imagine that that would be the
primary story of people in a civilisation</p>
<p t="3287150" d="1250">that was somewhat fragile.</p>
<p t="3288400" d="4570">They’re a hell of a lot more worried about
being invaded by the next, you know, round</p>
<p t="3292970" d="4170">of barbarians, or having their crops fail,
or being flooded out or something like that,</p>
<p t="3297140" d="4439">than they are concerned about whether or not
the whole state apparatus has become corrupt</p>
<p t="3301579" d="1040">and is going to collapse.</p>
<p t="3302619" d="4000">Now they’re partly concerned about that,
because remember Marduk, the emperor, is supposed</p>
<p t="3306619" d="5230">to be being a good Marduk and keeping an eye
on everything.</p>
<p t="3311849" d="5490">But the myth, the mythic structure only talks
about Apsu a tiny little bit, it basically</p>
<p t="3317339" d="4500">says ‘don’t kill Tiamat’s consort or
you’ll make her angry’.</p>
<p t="3321839" d="2990">The Egyptians take that a lot farther.</p>
<p t="3324829" d="3071">They look at Osiris and they say ‘well he
was… there was something really good about</p>
<p t="3327900" d="1000">him.</p>
<p t="3328900" d="4110">Without him we wouldn’t even have our state,
so we bloody well better be happy about that,</p>
<p t="3333010" d="3450">because the state is better than no state’.</p>
<p t="3336460" d="4950">You know, you could say pathological order
is better than absolute chaos.</p>
<p t="3341410" d="4280">Now you can have an argument about that but…
whatever, it’s, you know, it depends on</p>
<p t="3345690" d="1830">how pathological the order, obviously.</p>
<p t="3347520" d="4769">But it isn’t that untrammeled chaos is a
good solution.</p>
<p t="3352289" d="6290">I think that you can, and I’m only using
this as an example… you know, the Americans,</p>
<p t="3358579" d="7920">and us as well, went into Iraq to take out
a person who was clearly a dictator.</p>
<p t="3366499" d="5691">And who had… who was a pretty bad guy and
who had really bad sons.</p>
<p t="3372190" d="2770">And his heroes were people like Stalin and
Hitler.</p>
<p t="3374960" d="2609">Well, they took him out.</p>
<p t="3377569" d="2211">Well then what?</p>
<p t="3379780" d="3829">Well, then all hell broke loose.</p>
<p t="3383609" d="4801">You know, because the theory was, you take
out the bad guy at the top and all the good</p>
<p t="3388410" d="3199">guys at the bottom get together and instantly
they have a good government.</p>
<p t="3391609" d="3690">It’s like, that isn’t what happened at
all, what happened was the whole state degenerated</p>
<p t="3395299" d="1151">into chaos.</p>
<p t="3396450" d="5470">And partly out of that chaos came ISIS, and
it’s not self-evident that ISIS is preferable</p>
<p t="3401920" d="1649">to Hussein.</p>
<p t="3403569" d="7731">At least Hussein educated all the women, and
he was relatively secular, all things considered.</p>
<p t="3411300" d="6640">So I’m not making a case for Hussein, my
point is that, you know, you have to be careful</p>
<p t="3417940" d="4609">when you disrupt order, even when it’s pathological,
because God only knows what’s going to spring</p>
<p t="3422549" d="1000">forth.</p>
<p t="3423549" d="3960">And that doesn’t mean that you should never
try to overcome pathological order, but it</p>
<p t="3427509" d="3661">does mean that you should be very, very careful
when you do so.</p>
<p t="3431170" d="3800">You know, you have to do a micro-analysis
in some sense to make sure that you know what</p>
<p t="3434970" d="3490">the hell you’re doing.</p>
<p t="3438460" d="4139">Alright so anyways, Osiris, he’s a good
guy man, he established the state, he was</p>
<p t="3442599" d="6291">a great guy, he was a hero, he, you know,
made order out of chaos, and that’s where</p>
<p t="3448890" d="1000">you live, so great.</p>
<p t="3449890" d="6409">But he’s a little old, a little out of date,
and he’s wilfully blind, and that’s so</p>
<p t="3456299" d="6101">smart because I think what the Egyptians did
is encapsulate in narrative form the primary</p>
<p t="3462400" d="2250">danger of all human institutions.</p>
<p t="3464650" d="1459">There’s two of them.</p>
<p t="3466109" d="3990">And Eliade talks about this a lot with regards
to flood mythology.</p>
<p t="3470099" d="1740">So here’s an example.</p>
<p t="3471839" d="3720">There are flood myths all over the world,
and there may have even been a flood, there’s</p>
<p t="3475559" d="4490">pretty good archeological evidence for that,
that there was a great flood about 13,000</p>
<p t="3480049" d="4700">years ago, when a bunch of comets hit the
Earth and melted the North American ice shield,</p>
<p t="3484749" d="1000">but we won’t get into that.</p>
<p t="3485749" d="4921">But it doesn’t really matter, because the
mythological sub-structure of the story still</p>
<p t="3490670" d="4339">has the same meaning regardless of its historical
reality.</p>
<p t="3495009" d="5191">So in the Biblical story of the flood, basically
what happens is that humanity is created,</p>
<p t="3500200" d="2599">then they degenerate rapidly.</p>
<p t="3502799" d="4530">And they get so degenerate, which is sort
of like the elder Gods getting out of hand</p>
<p t="3507329" d="4250">in the Mesopotamian story, that God thinks,
‘oh to hell with all of you, you’re a</p>
<p t="3511579" d="3430">big mistake, I’m just going to wipe you
out’.</p>
<p t="3515009" d="5360">But he finds one good guy, that’s Noah,
and out of Noah, who’s like another Adam,</p>
<p t="3520369" d="3331">in some sense, the world of human beings is
regenerated.</p>
<p t="3523700" d="7059">But the idea is that corrupt people get washed
away.</p>
<p t="3530759" d="5290">And Eliade talks about the flood myth all
over the world, Mircea Eliade, and he says</p>
<p t="3536049" d="6470">that generally speaking there’s two reasons
why the deities flood the planet.</p>
<p t="3542519" d="4800">And one is the system is old and out-dated,
and the second is that people are corrupt.</p>
<p t="3547319" d="3510">And then if you get the two things working
together, you get a system that’s out of</p>
<p t="3550829" d="4230">date that becomes pathological faster because
people are corrupt.</p>
<p t="3555059" d="4940">And so I think that you can use the flood
in New Orleans as a good example of that.</p>
<p t="3559999" d="4411">Because on the one hand you can say, well
it was a hurricane.</p>
<p t="3564410" d="1270">So that’s a natural disaster.</p>
<p t="3565680" d="6429">But on the other hand you could say, well
people knew the damn dykes were too weak,</p>
<p t="3572109" d="4071">and they didn’t do anything about it, you
know, they were only built for a hundred year</p>
<p t="3576180" d="1000">storm.</p>
<p t="3577180" d="5100">And Louisiana is corrupt beyond belief, I
mean, for a democratic state, it’s not corrupt</p>
<p t="3582280" d="3680">compared to most states, but it’s really
corrupt compared to most democratic states,</p>
<p t="3585960" d="3829">and if you dump money into Louisiana it just
goes into people’s pockets anyways and the</p>
<p t="3589789" d="2171">infrastructure doesn’t get fixed up.</p>
<p t="3591960" d="3890">So then you might ask yourself, well was the
flood a consequence of a natural disaster,</p>
<p t="3595850" d="2150">or the blindness of the culture?</p>
<p t="3598000" d="2930">Well, you can never tell which of those are
true.</p>
<p t="3600930" d="5530">If you freeze to death in the winter is it
because it’s cold or because you’re stupid?</p>
<p t="3606460" d="4349">You know, there’s no difference between
those two things.</p>
<p t="3610809" d="4980">So if you get wiped out, it’s because nature
comes after you and because your culture isn’t</p>
<p t="3615789" d="1851">sufficient to protect.</p>
<p t="3617640" d="2240">And so you can’t separate those two things.</p>
<p t="3619880" d="6340">Okay, so… now the other case that the Egyptians
are making, and this is quite cool, is that</p>
<p t="3626220" d="6540">if you take a system that’s doing just fine,
and you just leave it alone long enough, it</p>
<p t="3632760" d="2349">becomes dysfunctional.</p>
<p t="3635109" d="1291">And there is a bunch of reasons for that.</p>
<p t="3636400" d="6790">I mean, you know, you can imagine that you
take your laptop, and it’s in perfect working</p>
<p t="3643190" d="5159">order, and you put it in the closet for twenty
years, and you take it out, what do you have?</p>
<p t="3648349" d="2201">Well, it’ll still turn on.</p>
<p t="3650550" d="1780">Do you have a laptop?</p>
<p t="3652330" d="6060">Well no, by then it won’t even work, it
won’t be able to communicate with the internet,</p>
<p t="3658390" d="4080">there won’t be any peripherals that could
plug into it, the software would be so outdated</p>
<p t="3662470" d="1519">that you wouldn’t even know how to use it.</p>
<p t="3663989" d="2181">Like it’s a brick, basically.</p>
<p t="3666170" d="5540">And so the point is that, and you can really
see this with electronic equipment, a perfectly</p>
<p t="3671710" d="6559">functional thing, maintained in stasis, of
its own accord becomes dysfunctional.</p>
<p t="3678269" d="4451">And so what that means is that you have to
run around like a mad hyena just keeping your</p>
<p t="3682720" d="1730">things working.</p>
<p t="3684450" d="4940">Now of course you know that, because how much
time do you spend in a month updating your</p>
<p t="3689390" d="1000">electronics?</p>
<p t="3690390" d="2919">You know, it’s just a treadmill of updates.</p>
<p t="3693309" d="4621">I think part of the reason they haven’t
contributed to overall productivity is because</p>
<p t="3697930" d="5829">people take all the time they used to waste
typing things out on paper trying to keep</p>
<p t="3703759" d="3271">their efficient electronics actually working.</p>
<p t="3707030" d="3209">And you know, learning all the things you
have to learn and re-learning them.</p>
<p t="3710239" d="3060">There’s this scene in Alice in Wonderland.</p>
<p t="3713299" d="3591">So Alice is in the Underworld, right?</p>
<p t="3716890" d="2169">And she meets the Red Queen down there.</p>
<p t="3719059" d="1000">So that’s Mother Nature.</p>
<p t="3720059" d="2690">And she’s always running around going ‘off
with their heads!</p>
<p t="3722749" d="4631">Off with their heads!’ in an arbitrary way,
which is of course what the Red Queen does.</p>
<p t="3727380" d="7260">And at one point she tells Alice, which is
such a… it’s such a remarkably deep line,</p>
<p t="3734640" d="5150">she says to Alice ‘in my Kingdom you have
to run as fast as you can just to stay in</p>
<p t="3739790" d="1120">the same place.’</p>
<p t="3740910" d="1480">And that’s exactly right.</p>
<p t="3742390" d="6719">So you can think, the environment that you’re
trying to adapt to is a dynamic concatenation</p>
<p t="3749109" d="3480">of patterns and it’s transforming across
time.</p>
<p t="3752589" d="4250">Not completely unpredictably, but certainly
not predictably.</p>
<p t="3756839" d="5381">And so that means if you build a structure
that’s adapted to it, that structure has</p>
<p t="3762220" d="5379">to change and flow in keeping with the change
and flow of the underlying environment or</p>
<p t="3767599" d="1801">it gets outdated.</p>
<p t="3769400" d="3540">You know, it gets obsolescent.</p>
<p t="3772940" d="4340">And so all you have to do is sit there and
do nothing and you become obsolescent.</p>
<p t="3777280" d="3450">And so that’s the problem with Osiris being
old.</p>
<p t="3780730" d="4789">He was a good guy when he was young, but he’s
old now, and the old solutions don’t solve</p>
<p t="3785519" d="1580">the new problems.</p>
<p t="3787099" d="5291">And you could call that an Egyptian existential
statement.</p>
<p t="3792390" d="1979">All of you have a culture.</p>
<p t="3794369" d="1841">It’s old.</p>
<p t="3796210" d="1000">It doesn’t apply.</p>
<p t="3797210" d="1250">Or it doesn’t apply well.</p>
<p t="3798460" d="2119">And so what are you going to do with it?</p>
<p t="3800579" d="1730">Are you going to throw the whole thing out?</p>
<p t="3802309" d="4220">Well we know what happens, the Mesopotamians
already told us what happens if you do that.</p>
<p t="3806529" d="4460">It’s like, Tiamat comes flooding back and
all hell breaks loose, so you can’t throw</p>
<p t="3810989" d="4811">everything away, but it doesn’t work very
well, so it’s up to you to figure out how</p>
<p t="3815800" d="3039">to fix it.</p>
<p t="3818839" d="3381">Okay so… but now Osiris has got another
problem.</p>
<p t="3822220" d="8550">So you might say… well let’s say you’ve
got an old computer (this, by the way [points</p>
<p t="3830770" d="5450">to computer], in case you haven’t noticed,
is a very old computer), and if you keep tapping</p>
<p t="3836220" d="3970">on it, and upgrading it a little bit, you
could keep it more or less up-to-date.</p>
<p t="3840190" d="2270">At some point you’re going to throw the
whole damn thing away.</p>
<p t="3842460" d="5099">But you could do incremental changes to it
on a continual basis, and the thing will more</p>
<p t="3847559" d="2030">or less stay functional.</p>
<p t="3849589" d="5551">You could think about those incremental changes
as partial revolutions, right?</p>
<p t="3855140" d="2100">Remember that hierarchy.</p>
<p t="3857240" d="2349">Now and then you have to change the operating
system.</p>
<p t="3859589" d="4581">That sucks, because that means everything
operating underneath virtually has to change.</p>
<p t="3864170" d="5929">But more often you’re doing a tweak here
and a tweak there, at lower, more specific</p>
<p t="3870099" d="4740">levels, and if you tweak enough then the probability
that the whole thing is going to collapse</p>
<p t="3874839" d="2940">and you’ll have to do a clean install is
quite low.</p>
<p t="3877779" d="3921">Well the same thing applies to the state,
logically enough.</p>
<p t="3881700" d="1919">This is the state.</p>
<p t="3883619" d="3490">If you think that your laptop isn’t the
state then you’re not thinking about your</p>
<p t="3887109" d="1250">laptop properly.</p>
<p t="3888359" d="1260">It’s the state.</p>
<p t="3889619" d="6200">And it’s going to be more and more the state
as we progress over the next twenty years.</p>
<p t="3895819" d="3970">So you know that if you’re aware and you
keep the updates up and you stay awake that</p>
<p t="3899789" d="1861">you can keep the thing functioning.</p>
<p t="3901650" d="3750">At some point it’s going to get anachronistic,
it’s better to just replace it, which is</p>
<p t="3905400" d="3000">also by the way what’s going to happen to
all of you, right?</p>
<p t="3908400" d="5199">And it’s a decision that evolution, in some
sense, and biology has made, that at some</p>
<p t="3913599" d="6460">point trying to keep you updated is so bloody
complicated that you might as well get rid</p>
<p t="3920059" d="4621">of the whole thing and let something new occur,
and I’m really dead serious about this,</p>
<p t="3924680" d="2130">because death evolved.</p>
<p t="3926810" d="4429">You know, you have elements in you that are
three and a half billion years old.</p>
<p t="3931239" d="1681">Not everything dies.</p>
<p t="3932920" d="5389">And some creatures are functionally immortal.</p>
<p t="3938309" d="1000">But not us.</p>
<p t="3939309" d="3841">And the reason is, well at some point we’re
too old to be updated, and so that’s the</p>
<p t="3943150" d="2719">end of that.</p>
<p t="3945869" d="3700">Seems to happen about over a hundred year
period.</p>
<p t="3949569" d="5441">Anyways, now imagine you just ignore your
computer completely.</p>
<p t="3955010" d="2489">You don’t update the thing at all.</p>
<p t="3957499" d="8610">Well, it’s going to get anachronistic of
its own accord, but if you refuse to engage</p>
<p t="3966109" d="5051">in those operations that would keep it updated,
it’s going to get anachronistic a lot faster.</p>
<p t="3971160" d="2909">And that’s what happens to Osiris, they
say the same thing.</p>
<p t="3974069" d="6121">It’s like, he’s old, and that’s part
of the problem, he’s past his prime.</p>
<p t="3980190" d="2990">But the worst part of the problem is that
he’s wilfully blind.</p>
<p t="3983180" d="4939">He won’t take action even though he knows
it’s necessary.</p>
<p t="3988119" d="5791">And so he gets out of date and pathological
faster than necessary.</p>
<p t="3993910" d="5830">Now when you hear in the flood stories that
God is angry about the sins of men, and that’s</p>
<p t="3999740" d="2319">why He washes everything away, it’s the
same idea.</p>
<p t="4002059" d="6351">Now the word ‘sin’ comes from the Greek
word hamartia, and hamartia is an archery</p>
<p t="4008410" d="1000">term.</p>
<p t="4009410" d="3139">And to sin means not to hit the centre of
the target.</p>
<p t="4012549" d="6331">And so basically the idea in the flood stories
is that if enough people aren’t aiming at</p>
<p t="4018880" d="5619">the target, or hitting the centre, then things
are going to get so corrupt and unstable that</p>
<p t="4024499" d="2001">everything is going to get washed away.</p>
<p t="4026500" d="5039">And that’s right, it’s exactly, perfectly
accurate.</p>
<p t="4031539" d="1450">Which is very, very cool.</p>
<p t="4032989" d="1941">It’s remarkable that that’s the case.</p>
<p t="4034930" d="5980">Okay, so now Osiris (because this is a myth)
has an evil brother.</p>
<p t="4040910" d="1209">Now that’s a pretty common occurrence.</p>
<p t="4042119" d="4922">If you look at The Lion King (which is very
much the Egyptian creation myth, by the way),</p>
<p t="4047041" d="2879">the Lion King… what’s the old guy’s
name?</p>
<p t="4049920" d="4419">The old lion.</p>
<p t="4054339" d="2210">Mufasa.</p>
<p t="4056549" d="1310">He has a brother, right?</p>
<p t="4057859" d="1160">What’s his brother?</p>
<p t="4059019" d="1000">Scar!</p>
<p t="4060019" d="1951">And what’s the problem with Scar?</p>
<p t="4061970" d="1599">He’s scarred.</p>
<p t="4063569" d="6550">Right, so you know, he says he’s from the
bottom of the gene pool.</p>
<p t="4070119" d="6371">And you know, he’s been in second place
all his life, and he’s very, very intelligent.</p>
<p t="4076490" d="1869">He worships his own intelligence.</p>
<p t="4078359" d="4960">He regards himself as a higher form of intellect,
which is a very common characteristic of evil</p>
<p t="4083319" d="3871">brother is mythology, and there’s a reason
for that.</p>
<p t="4087190" d="2910">And he’s scarred because life has scarred
him.</p>
<p t="4090100" d="4080">And he’s bitter and resentful and he wants
to bring down the order and he wants to kill</p>
<p t="4094180" d="1000">the son of the king.</p>
<p t="4095180" d="3179">I mean, he’s a bad guy.</p>
<p t="4098359" d="4541">Now the problem is that Mufasa underestimates
him, and that’s exactly what happens to</p>
<p t="4102900" d="1000">Osiris.</p>
<p t="4103900" d="3140">So Osiris has this brother, Set, or Seth.</p>
<p t="4107040" d="5659">And I’ve a sneaking suspicion that our word
‘set’, for setting Sun is from that word,</p>
<p t="4112699" d="2040">although I don’t know that for sure.</p>
<p t="4114739" d="7350">But sounds are generally… sounds in language
remain stable across a very long period of</p>
<p t="4122089" d="5460">time, and set was definitely, from the Egyptian
perspective, the enemy of the Sun.</p>
<p t="4127549" d="4190">You know, that’s part of the Egyptian cosmology.</p>
<p t="4131739" d="4571">And the Sun is associated with illumination
and brightness and daytime consciousness and</p>
<p t="4136310" d="2220">clear apprehension and vision, and all those
things.</p>
<p t="4138530" d="5289">And of course night is opposed to that, unconsciousness
and blindness and danger, and all of those</p>
<p t="4143819" d="2040">things.</p>
<p t="4145859" d="5820">So anyways, Set, he’s pretending to be Osiris’s
loving brother, but he’s not.</p>
<p t="4151679" d="3171">He’s plotting to overthrow him first chance
he gets.</p>
<p t="4154850" d="4900">And so he’s just sitting in the background,
feeding him bad advice, waiting for him to</p>
<p t="4159750" d="2580">get weak enough so that he can strike.</p>
<p t="4162330" d="6059">Now the name Set is taken by the Egyptian
Coptics and turned into Satan.</p>
<p t="4168389" d="3531">So Set is the precursor of the Christian Satan.</p>
<p t="4171920" d="5529">So the reason I’m telling you that is so
that you can see how these ideas, these archetypal</p>
<p t="4177449" d="8140">ideas of corruption and evil are extraordinarily
ancient, and they’re part of the process</p>
<p t="4185589" d="4531">whereby people are trying to figure out what
the right way is to act and what the wrong</p>
<p t="4190120" d="4019">way is to act, and what the right way is to
set up institutions and what the wrong way</p>
<p t="4194139" d="2261">is to set up institutions.</p>
<p t="4196400" d="2219">So it’s a very, very long process.</p>
<p t="4198619" d="4161">And it’s not something that someone just
sat around and thought up.</p>
<p t="4202780" d="3020">It’s way, way deeper than that.</p>
<p t="4205800" d="6450">So anyways, Osiris is being, you know, getting
weaker and being blind, and one day Set thinks</p>
<p t="4212250" d="4929">‘alright, time for action’, so he takes
his brother and he chops him up into little</p>
<p t="4217179" d="1000">pieces.</p>
<p t="4218179" d="6051">Now, Osiris is a god, so you’re not going
to kill him, but you can make it very difficult</p>
<p t="4224230" d="2420">for him to get his act together.</p>
<p t="4226650" d="3160">So basically what happens is Osiris falls
apart.</p>
<p t="4229810" d="2860">Now think about that.</p>
<p t="4232670" d="2410">You fall apart.</p>
<p t="4235080" d="1139">People say that.</p>
<p t="4236219" d="1551">The relationship fell apart.</p>
<p t="4237770" d="1550">I fell apart.</p>
<p t="4239320" d="1460">Things fall apart.</p>
<p t="4240780" d="1160">What does that mean?</p>
<p t="4241940" d="8170">Well it means that a thing is usually a complex
unity of multiple sub-entities, and sometimes</p>
<p t="4250110" d="5231">what holds them together, the superordinate
structure, collapses, and all that’s left</p>
<p t="4255341" d="1000">are the things.</p>
<p t="4256341" d="5629">Because you know, when you fall apart, you
don’t completely fall apart.</p>
<p t="4261970" d="1000">You know, you’re still alive.</p>
<p t="4262970" d="5150">What’s happened is that the unity of your
psychological structure has been fragmented.</p>
<p t="4268120" d="1720">And that’s a trip to the underworld, man.</p>
<p t="4269840" d="1890">So you’re going to be unhappy.</p>
<p t="4271730" d="3630">I broke up with my partner and then I fell
apart.</p>
<p t="4275360" d="1330">Well everyone knows what that means.</p>
<p t="4276690" d="3710">Okay, so that’s what happens to Osiris.</p>
<p t="4280400" d="1799">Things fall apart.</p>
<p t="4282199" d="5861">So then Set, being a sneaky sort of character,
takes all of Osiris’s pieces and he puts</p>
<p t="4288060" d="1000">them all over Egypt.</p>
<p t="4289060" d="5550">He hides them here and there so that Osiris
is going to have a hell of a time recollecting</p>
<p t="4294610" d="3739">himself and getting his act together and coming
back.</p>
<p t="4298349" d="3040">And so, things fall apart.</p>
<p t="4301389" d="6371">Now the same thing happens in The Lion King,
obviously, because Scar kills Mufasa.</p>
<p t="4307760" d="7440">So fine, then Set rules.</p>
<p t="4315200" d="2470">That’s not a good day for the Egyptians.</p>
<p t="4317670" d="4420">Remember what happens in The Lion King when
Scar rules?</p>
<p t="4322090" d="3810">The environment becomes completely devastated
because they overhunt, right?</p>
<p t="4325900" d="2480">So you get total environmental devastation.</p>
<p t="4328380" d="2670">It’s all black and burnt.</p>
<p t="4331050" d="2189">And, you know, nothing is functioning properly.</p>
<p t="4333239" d="5121">And remember after Simba comes back to set
things right it starts to rain and everything</p>
<p t="4338360" d="1900">comes back to life.</p>
<p t="4340260" d="5410">Well it’s another indication of the idea
that you really can’t separate the environment</p>
<p t="4345670" d="5830">from the culture, you know, they’re in a
dynamic system of interaction.</p>
<p t="4351500" d="3530">Anyways, Osiris, things have fallen apart.</p>
<p t="4355030" d="4390">Well Osiris has a wife, he has to, he’s
King of Order.</p>
<p t="4359420" d="3779">Well, we’re missing someone, we’re missing
the Queen of Chaos, we’re missing the Queen</p>
<p t="4363199" d="1000">of the Underworld.</p>
<p t="4364199" d="1081">That’s Isis.</p>
<p t="4365280" d="2310">Now Isis was a long-lasting goddess.</p>
<p t="4367590" d="3000">There’s been goddess religions forever.</p>
<p t="4370590" d="9210">There’s an idea among misinformed feminist
anthropologists that the original religious</p>
<p t="4379800" d="5770">structures were feminine, earth-goddess type
religions, and then they were replaced by</p>
<p t="4385570" d="1930">patriarchal religions.</p>
<p t="4387500" d="2750">And there’s no historical evidence for that.</p>
<p t="4390250" d="4750">And the best work I know on that is actually
through the Jungians…</p>
<p t="4395000" d="1950">Jung and Eric Neumann.</p>
<p t="4396950" d="3470">Because what they figured out… they’re
kind of on the same track, thinking about</p>
<p t="4400420" d="4660">the same idea, that there seems to be a shift
between matriarchal values to patriarchal</p>
<p t="4405080" d="2659">values, and that that was a historical shift.</p>
<p t="4407739" d="4360">But what they actually found out instead was
that’s a shift in mythological idea.</p>
<p t="4412099" d="2431">It’s not a historical reality.</p>
<p t="4414530" d="4040">And it’s useful as a mythological idea but
you shouldn’t project it backwards onto</p>
<p t="4418570" d="2460">time and make it a historical reality.</p>
<p t="4421030" d="4830">Anyways, Isis, she’s been Queen of the Underworld
forever.</p>
<p t="4425860" d="4400">Now of course, when order collapses, chaos
reappears, and that’s what happens.</p>
<p t="4430260" d="5160">Isis pops up out of the Underworld and her
husband’s missing and she’s not very happy</p>
<p t="4435420" d="1000">about that.</p>
<p t="4436420" d="4420">So she wanders all over Egypt looking for
his phallus.</p>
<p t="4440840" d="10170">And so… now that’s an interesting idea,
because it touches on the biology of innovation,</p>
<p t="4451010" d="1000">in some sense.</p>
<p t="4452010" d="3979">So you’ve heard of the notion of a seminal
idea.</p>
<p t="4455989" d="5741">Well, that’s a mythologically informed metaphor.</p>
<p t="4461730" d="8250">And so the idea is that, in biological reproduction,
semen falls on fertile ground, and out of</p>
<p t="4469980" d="2600">that something emerges.</p>
<p t="4472580" d="8470">Well, there’s a tight analogue between that
and what happens in the Egyptian myth with</p>
<p t="4481050" d="1240">regards to sexuality.</p>
<p t="4482290" d="4420">Now, Jung and Freud had a big argument about
this, eh, because Freud thought that you could</p>
<p t="4486710" d="4870">reduce everything to sexuality.</p>
<p t="4491580" d="5050">And Jung said no no, what you don’t understand
is that sexuality itself is often used as</p>
<p t="4496630" d="3290">a symbol for something even more profound.</p>
<p t="4499920" d="4790">And they didn’t agree on that, and that’s
part of why they went their separate ways.</p>
<p t="4504710" d="6509">Freud was very much unwilling to believe that
religion could be anything other than a set</p>
<p t="4511219" d="6851">of defensive and repressive beliefs and practices
designed to protect you from death anxiety.</p>
<p t="4518070" d="5310">That was basically his hypothesis.</p>
<p t="4523380" d="2300">And it’s wrong.</p>
<p t="4525680" d="3890">I mean, there is that element, of course,
because you can use dogma to protect yourself</p>
<p t="4529570" d="2520">against all sorts of things.</p>
<p t="4532090" d="2589">But you can’t reduce a whole damn thing
to that.</p>
<p t="4534679" d="6711">You have got to watch people of any type,
that are intellectuals, who will tell you</p>
<p t="4541390" d="3410">that everything can be reduced to one cause.</p>
<p t="4544800" d="3560">You know, it’s like a misplaced monotheism.</p>
<p t="4548360" d="1000">Lots of people do that.</p>
<p t="4549360" d="4790">For Marx it’s economics or class warfare,
for Freud it’s sexuality (although he also</p>
<p t="4554150" d="2580">considers aggression), for Foucault it’s
power.</p>
<p t="4556730" d="3400">You know, it’s like no, it’s not that
simple.</p>
<p t="4560130" d="3550">You can make a good story out of those motivations,
because they’re powerful motivations, and</p>
<p t="4563680" d="4950">they do affect everything, but that doesn’t
mean they cause everything uni-dimensionally.</p>
<p t="4568630" d="5670">Okay, so anyways, Isis pops up, Queen of the
Underworld, Set takes control, chaos emerges</p>
<p t="4574300" d="6299">from the Underworld, Isis wanders around,
she finds Osiris’s phallus, and she makes</p>
<p t="4580599" d="1000">herself pregnant.</p>
<p t="4581599" d="1941">Well, so what does that mean?</p>
<p t="4583540" d="2650">Well, it means a lot of things.</p>
<p t="4586190" d="5950">One thing it means is that if a great system
falls apart, the parts still have life.</p>
<p t="4592140" d="2590">And, you know, you could think about that.</p>
<p t="4594730" d="4590">People often talk about the stability (to
the degree that it’s stable)… part of</p>
<p t="4599320" d="6799">the stability of capitalism is its creative
destruction.</p>
<p t="4606119" d="4131">Capitalism allows great enterprises to collapse
and disperse.</p>
<p t="4610250" d="4170">But they don’t break down into sub-atomic
particles, right?</p>
<p t="4614420" d="5250">They collapse but the pieces they collapse
into still have life, some of them more than</p>
<p t="4619670" d="1000">others.</p>
<p t="4620670" d="3850">And then if something collapses, sometimes
part of the thing that collapsed has enough</p>
<p t="4624520" d="3130">life to build something new out of the pieces.</p>
<p t="4627650" d="5299">That’s the same thing that happens to you
when you undergo a radical, revolutionary</p>
<p t="4632949" d="2741">transformation in your character.</p>
<p t="4635690" d="2299">You might even feel like you’re dying.</p>
<p t="4637989" d="5541">And in some sense the organising principles
by which you lived are dying.</p>
<p t="4643530" d="1680">That’s what’s taking you out.</p>
<p t="4645210" d="1320">And it’s painful.</p>
<p t="4646530" d="2180">Those things are alive.</p>
<p t="4648710" d="4510">It’s no trivial matter to be taken apart.</p>
<p t="4653220" d="4660">But you know, you hope that you get taken
apart, you can find some new information down</p>
<p t="4657880" d="4989">there in the chaos, and that’s your union
with Isis, roughly speaking.</p>
<p t="4662869" d="5241">And out of that union of information from
the chaos and the parts of you that are left,</p>
<p t="4668110" d="1900">you could come springing back.</p>
<p t="4670010" d="4140">And everyone hopes that, and often it’s
the case.</p>
<p t="4674150" d="4190">You know, one of the lessons you can derive
from Egyptian mythology is bloody well stay</p>
<p t="4678340" d="1080">awake.</p>
<p t="4679420" d="2299">And make the little corrections when you need
to.</p>
<p t="4681719" d="5091">Don’t be wilfully blind, because if you’re
wilfully blind you’re going to store up</p>
<p t="4686810" d="3679">chaos, because you’re not keeping it at
bay.</p>
<p t="4690489" d="3481">And then one day when you’re weak it’s
just going to take you out.</p>
<p t="4693970" d="1000">And that happens.</p>
<p t="4694970" d="1910">That happens to people all the time.</p>
<p t="4696880" d="6200">They let things around them degenerate back
into chaos.</p>
<p t="4703080" d="3550">And then one day they’re weak, and something
else comes along to hit them, and they’re</p>
<p t="4706630" d="1000">done.</p>
<p t="4707630" d="1000">They can’t get up.</p>
<p t="4708630" d="1720">It’s too heavy and too hard a hit.</p>
<p t="4710350" d="5600">And so then they’re down in the Underworld
and they stay there.</p>
<p t="4715950" d="3080">The general rule is if you’re going to go
to the Underworld, it’s better to go on</p>
<p t="4719030" d="2709">purpose and for short voyages.</p>
<p t="4721739" d="3751">And that’s the idea behind voluntary exposure,
right?</p>
<p t="4725490" d="1810">Find out what you don’t want to look at.</p>
<p t="4727300" d="4310">It’s easy enough to do that, because you’re
going to see yourself avoiding it.</p>
<p t="4731610" d="5270">Then figure out how you can approach it and
order some of it, in as big chunks as you</p>
<p t="4736880" d="1089">can manage.</p>
<p t="4737969" d="2351">And you can do that all the time.</p>
<p t="4740320" d="1290">Stay awake.</p>
<p t="4741610" d="5170">Because then you keep your infrastructure
properly maintained, and the probability that</p>
<p t="4746780" d="3500">you will tolerate a powerful blow is much,
much higher.</p>
<p t="4750280" d="1280">It’s not certain.</p>
<p t="4751560" d="1849">That’s the other thing about myths.</p>
<p t="4753409" d="5971">They tell you the best way to negotiate through
life, but they never tell you that that will</p>
<p t="4759380" d="1130">work.</p>
<p t="4760510" d="3109">They just tell you that that’s your best
bet.</p>
<p t="4763619" d="2411">And so yeah, maybe that’s enough.</p>
<p t="4766030" d="1430">It might be enough.</p>
<p t="4767460" d="7070">Okay, anyways, so Isis finds Osiris’s phallus,
and gets pregnant.</p>
<p t="4774530" d="2540">And then back to the Underworld she goes.</p>
<p t="4777070" d="3040">And she goes through her pregnancy and she
gives birth to Horus.</p>
<p t="4780110" d="1950">Now that’s a pretty common story, right?</p>
<p t="4782060" d="4570">That’s the long lost rightful king.</p>
<p t="4786630" d="4569">You know, in King Arthur, for example, Arthur
has to be taken away from the castle to be</p>
<p t="4791199" d="1661">raised, basically in isolation.</p>
<p t="4792860" d="2540">It’s a very, very common story.</p>
<p t="4795400" d="1799">And the reason… the same thing happens Harry
Potter, right?</p>
<p t="4797199" d="9091">Harry Potter is stuck with these Dursleys
and they just… they’re like every resentful</p>
<p t="4806290" d="4080">child’s image of their parents.</p>
<p t="4810370" d="3600">Maybe it’s more like every resentful 13-year-old’s
image of their parents.</p>
<p t="4813970" d="7319">And you know, the truth of the matter is that
you are kind of stuck off in the normative</p>
<p t="4821289" d="2160">wastelands of your culture.</p>
<p t="4823449" d="5190">You have your specific parents, they’re
not archetypal representatives of reality,</p>
<p t="4828639" d="1821">they’re your parents.</p>
<p t="4830460" d="5860">They’re nature and culture, but in finite
and flawed human form.</p>
<p t="4836320" d="6509">And what that means in part is you are raised
outside the domain of your culture.</p>
<p t="4842829" d="5431">It’s old, it isn’t working very well,
and it’s not transmitted very well to you.</p>
<p t="4848260" d="3970">So you grow up outside of it, you’re alienated
from it.</p>
<p t="4852230" d="7060">That’s that existential alienation, but
people have always felt alienated from their</p>
<p t="4859290" d="5060">damn culture, because it’s old, and it’s
sort of blind.</p>
<p t="4864350" d="3940">And there you are young and dynamic and full
of life and all it’s telling you is you</p>
<p t="4868290" d="1639">can do this and you can’t do that.</p>
<p t="4869929" d="4871">And then you know, lying to you about some
things, and doing a pretty nasty job of others.</p>
<p t="4874800" d="2450">So you’re outside it, you’re alienated
from it.</p>
<p t="4877250" d="1340">And that’s what happens to Horus.</p>
<p t="4878590" d="1640">He’s outside, in the Underworld.</p>
<p t="4880230" d="1259">That’s where he gets born.</p>
<p t="4881489" d="3051">And so that’s worth thinking about too.</p>
<p t="4884540" d="2710">Anyways, he grows up.</p>
<p t="4887250" d="2849">Now Horus is an interesting sort of character.</p>
<p t="4890099" d="3931">So you’ve all seen the image of the Egyptian
eye, right?</p>
<p t="4894030" d="1000">Everyone knows that image.</p>
<p t="4895030" d="1240">Even now, which is pretty cool.</p>
<p t="4896270" d="4380">So it’s got an eyebrow and it’s got an
eye in the middle and then it’s got the</p>
<p t="4900650" d="5060">iris, and usually the pupil is so big that
it covers the whole iris.</p>
<p t="4905710" d="4679">And there’s a variety of reasons for that,
but one of the reasons is that it symbolises</p>
<p t="4910389" d="1000">interest and attention.</p>
<p t="4911389" d="2661">So when you’re interested in something,
your pupil grows.</p>
<p t="4914050" d="4580">And so Horus’s pupil is really big, and
he’s checking things out like mad.</p>
<p t="4918630" d="4070">So Horus is the eye, and he’s also a falcon.</p>
<p t="4922700" d="1700">And you might say, well why is he a falcon?</p>
<p t="4924400" d="5890">And the answer to that is falcons are birds
of prey, and they can really see.</p>
<p t="4930290" d="4480">So that’s another amplification of the idea
of the eye.</p>
<p t="4934770" d="4309">Now falcons fly up above everything, even
above the pyramids.</p>
<p t="4939079" d="4821">And they can see wherever they want to see,
and so Horus is the thing that flies up above</p>
<p t="4943900" d="5510">the structures of mankind, in some sense,
and can see them panoramically.</p>
<p t="4949410" d="4539">So he’s not encapsulated in any particular
pyramid, he’s the thing that’s above all</p>
<p t="4953949" d="5881">pyramids and looking and providing you with
an overview.</p>
<p t="4959830" d="4050">And I think the best way to conceptualise
Horus in modern terms is attention.</p>
<p t="4963880" d="5319">That’s not thought, that’s a whole different
thing.</p>
<p t="4969199" d="6761">Like attention is what thought… attention
is the precursor to thought, in some sense.</p>
<p t="4975960" d="5480">Attention is where you meet meaning, and that’s
another way of thinking about it.</p>
<p t="4981440" d="5710">Attention is actually where you take undifferentiated
chaos and start to turn it into order.</p>
<p t="4987150" d="4089">And you think about… how much do you like
being paid attention to?</p>
<p t="4991239" d="1000">People love that.</p>
<p t="4992239" d="3241">Children, you don’t pay attention to them,
they become pathological.</p>
<p t="4995480" d="3259">You don’t pay attention to your partner,
your relationship dissolves.</p>
<p t="4998739" d="3231">No one pays attention to you, you crawl off
in a corner and die.</p>
<p t="5001970" d="3100">Advertisers pay for your attention.</p>
<p t="5005070" d="5560">Like attention, that’s a currency, man,
that’s value.</p>
<p t="5010630" d="4370">And you like to be paid attention to when
you do good things, and maybe you’ll even</p>
<p t="5015000" d="3360">do terrible things so that someone pays attention
to you.</p>
<p t="5018360" d="1000">Attention’s a big deal.</p>
<p t="5019360" d="1520">We don’t understand it very well.</p>
<p t="5020880" d="3890">But anyways, the Egyptians conceptualised
it as a god.</p>
<p t="5024770" d="3389">And that’s smart, that’s a very smart
idea.</p>
<p t="5028159" d="5290">Anyways, Horus grows up in the Underworld,
and then when he gets kind of big and ready</p>
<p t="5033449" d="4431">to contend with the world, he thinks I’m
going to take the damn state back from my</p>
<p t="5037880" d="1000">evil uncle.</p>
<p t="5038880" d="3710">Well, that’s what you’re supposed to do.</p>
<p t="5042590" d="5100">You’re supposed to grow up, pay attention,
get yourself the hell out of the Underworld,</p>
<p t="5047690" d="3940">and then take your state back from your evil
uncle.</p>
<p t="5051630" d="1620">Okay, so what happens?</p>
<p t="5053250" d="1880">So Horus, he gets himself all prepared.</p>
<p t="5055130" d="7469">And he’s son of Order and Chaos, man, he’s
no second-rate character.</p>
<p t="5062599" d="3421">You remember… how many of you have seen
The Avengers movies?</p>
<p t="5066020" d="1000">Okay.</p>
<p t="5067020" d="4840">Okay so I think it’s Samuel Jackson, right?</p>
<p t="5071860" d="5239">Samuel Jackson is often in the background,
and if I remember correctly he’s kind of</p>
<p t="5077099" d="4351">like the mediator between these shadowy figures
that sort of exist as…</p>
<p t="5081450" d="4539">I don’t know, they all look like middle-aged
white men and they’re sort of like a power</p>
<p t="5085989" d="5121">group and they communicate on screen, I don’t
know exactly who they are.</p>
<p t="5091110" d="1810">But Jackson plays an intermediary.</p>
<p t="5092920" d="2690">But he is lacking an eye.</p>
<p t="5095610" d="4410">And part of the reason, you infer, that Jackson
is lacking an eye is because he’s had a</p>
<p t="5100020" d="4070">pretty long history of being involved in catastrophe.</p>
<p t="5104090" d="3760">And you know, one consequence of that is that
he’s become damaged.</p>
<p t="5107850" d="3050">Well, the same thing happens to Horus.</p>
<p t="5110900" d="4489">So Horus goes back and he says to Set, I see
you for who you are.</p>
<p t="5115389" d="2080">I know what you’re up to.</p>
<p t="5117469" d="1791">You’re working for destruction.</p>
<p t="5119260" d="1640">You want to take the state apart.</p>
<p t="5120900" d="2290">There’s nothing positive about what you’re
doing.</p>
<p t="5123190" d="2440">You facilitate deception.</p>
<p t="5125630" d="1069">So I’m taking the state back.</p>
<p t="5126699" d="3491">So they have a big fight.</p>
<p t="5130190" d="3080">And during the fight, Set tears out one of
Horus’s eyes.</p>
<p t="5133270" d="4530">Now that’s worth thinking about too, because
what it means (and this is exactly right)…</p>
<p t="5137800" d="3799">you know, one of the things Jung said about
encountering malevolence.</p>
<p t="5141599" d="7451">It’s like, let’s say that you wanted to
understand what the Nazis did.</p>
<p t="5149050" d="2270">And so you started to take it apart.</p>
<p t="5151320" d="4350">And at each little bit of exploration you
take it apart a little bit more deeply, and</p>
<p t="5155670" d="2460">then a little bit more deeply, and then a
little bit more deeply.</p>
<p t="5158130" d="1880">You want to get to the bottom of it.</p>
<p t="5160010" d="4700">Well you might ask yourself, well what’s
at the bottom of terrible things?</p>
<p t="5164710" d="4779">Well the answer to that… an answer to that…
is the archetype of evil.</p>
<p t="5169489" d="9101">And if you are to the degree that you encounter
that, even if you’re capable of god-like</p>
<p t="5178590" d="5690">attention, which is the case with Horus, the
probability is that that will be so devastating</p>
<p t="5184280" d="3180">that it will destroy half your consciousness.</p>
<p t="5187460" d="1720">That’s what happens to Horus.</p>
<p t="5189180" d="3370">And so that’s another thing I really like
about the myths, man.</p>
<p t="5192550" d="1570">They don’t mess around.</p>
<p t="5194120" d="2979">You’re supposed to come out of the Underworld,
you’re supposed to see what the hell’s</p>
<p t="5197099" d="5640">going on, you’re supposed to go back and
take the state away from its archaic institutions</p>
<p t="5202739" d="1201">and wilful blindness.</p>
<p t="5203940" d="5400">But if you really contend with that, you better
look out, because you’re contending with</p>
<p t="5209340" d="3810">something that you can barely master.</p>
<p t="5213150" d="5940">Anyways, Horus beats Set, despite the fact
that he has his eye torn out.</p>
<p t="5219090" d="4839">And so then he tell Set to go outside the
boundaries of the Kingdom and to never come</p>
<p t="5223929" d="1000">back.</p>
<p t="5224929" d="2871">Well, why doesn’t he kill him?</p>
<p t="5227800" d="1410">Well he can’t, he’s a god.</p>
<p t="5229210" d="1509">You can’t get rid of Set.</p>
<p t="5230719" d="4211">Set is the deity of the decomposition of states.</p>
<p t="5234930" d="2370">That’s not going away.</p>
<p t="5237300" d="3640">The best you can do is hold it at bay for
periods of time.</p>
<p t="5240940" d="3790">And you have to be awake and aware of its
constant presence.</p>
<p t="5244730" d="5659">Anyways, he chases Set away but he gets his
eye back.</p>
<p t="5250389" d="8250">And so he reclaims his consciousness from
malevolence, essentially.</p>
<p t="5258639" d="2201">And then you might think, okay, well what
should he do?</p>
<p t="5260840" d="5529">He should slap that eye back in his head,
and he’s defeated evil, so now he should</p>
<p t="5266369" d="1000">be king.</p>
<p t="5267369" d="3210">And that would be a good ending to the story,
but that isn’t what the Egyptians do, and</p>
<p t="5270579" d="5910">this is where they really get brilliant, in
my estimation.</p>
<p t="5276489" d="3801">So Horus takes his eye, and he goes back to
the Underworld.</p>
<p t="5280290" d="1590">So he does this voluntarily.</p>
<p t="5281880" d="2100">He goes back to the Underworld.</p>
<p t="5283980" d="4739">And he goes back to where Osiris is existing,
because it’s sort of the land of the dead.</p>
<p t="5288719" d="2420">And so Osiris has this weird existence.</p>
<p t="5291139" d="7161">He’s scattered all over Egypt, but his essence,
I suppose, his spirit, is down there in the</p>
<p t="5298300" d="3580">Underworld, which is… it’s not exactly
hell.</p>
<p t="5301880" d="1750">Hell is a suburb of the Underworld.</p>
<p t="5303630" d="3839">Like it’s the worst neighbourhood of the
Underworld, that’s a good way of thinking</p>
<p t="5307469" d="1000">about it.</p>
<p t="5308469" d="2440">You guys go to the Underworld fairly often.</p>
<p t="5310909" d="5210">You may take a rare side-trip to hell, and
you probably regret it.</p>
<p t="5316119" d="4401">And we can talk about that means, because
it actually has a very specific meaning.</p>
<p t="5320520" d="2829">Anyways, Osiris isn’t in hell, he’s just
in the Underworld.</p>
<p t="5323349" d="5071">So he’s sitting there sort of, you know,
inactive.</p>
<p t="5328420" d="1980">And in rough shape.</p>
<p t="5330400" d="8390">So Horus goes down to the Underworld, and
he finds Osiris, and he gives him an eye!</p>
<p t="5338790" d="1929">And so then Osiris can see again.</p>
<p t="5340719" d="3101">Remember, he couldn’t see, he was wilfully
blind, right?</p>
<p t="5343820" d="1910">And so that’s partly what led to his demise.</p>
<p t="5345730" d="4159">Horus give him this eye that’s been hard
fought.</p>
<p t="5349889" d="3221">It’s the eye with which he encountered evil.</p>
<p t="5353110" d="3860">He gives Osiris that eye, perks him right
up.</p>
<p t="5356970" d="7850">And so then Horus and Osiris go back to the
surface world, and they unite to form the</p>
<p t="5364820" d="1970">ruler of Egypt.</p>
<p t="5366790" d="5040">And so the idea is that the proper ruler is
obviously the thing that can pay attention</p>
<p t="5371830" d="5019">and conquer the pathology of the state and
wilful blindness, but it’s more that.</p>
<p t="5376849" d="4770">It’s the thing that does that and then rejuvenates
the state.</p>
<p t="5381619" d="10781">And you know, one of the things, I think this
is quite interesting… so the hippie culture</p>
<p t="5392400" d="6000">in the 1960s was a revolutionary culture,
and you can make a case that during the 60s,</p>
<p t="5398400" d="5420">and the latter part of the 50s, young people’s
attention was very much focused on certain</p>
<p t="5403820" d="2169">pathological elements of the state.</p>
<p t="5405989" d="4351">You know, the Civil Rights Movement seemed
to be a real thing, there was a movement towards</p>
<p t="5410340" d="5580">emancipation of women, there were lots of
things that I think you can look at from a</p>
<p t="5415920" d="3130">distance and say, you know, good work.</p>
<p t="5419050" d="6399">But then there was the other element of it,
which was, well, you know, down with the state</p>
<p t="5425449" d="1611">and don’t trust anyone over 30.</p>
<p t="5427060" d="4200">Well, that’s kind of stupid, because first
of all it’s not that long till you’re</p>
<p t="5431260" d="1620">30 and then what do you do?</p>
<p t="5432880" d="4580">And second, well no, you can’t throw the
damn baby out with the bathwater.</p>
<p t="5437460" d="2920">I mean first of all, you’re probably doing
that because you don’t want to grow up,</p>
<p t="5440380" d="1000">ever.</p>
<p t="5441380" d="1270">You’re just Peter Pan.</p>
<p t="5442650" d="7620">And second, it’s like, you can’t leave
Osiris languishing in the Underworld.</p>
<p t="5450270" d="3060">You have to give him vision and bring him
back up to the surface.</p>
<p t="5453330" d="5980">Because I don’t care how attentive you are,
if you’re also not wise you’re not going</p>
<p t="5459310" d="1520">to be good for anything.</p>
<p t="5460830" d="5130">And the wisdom is partly the integration of
the best your culture has to offer you into</p>
<p t="5465960" d="6100">your character, so that you can be an avatar
of culture, an attentive avatar of culture.</p>
<p t="5472060" d="1530">And then you’re a well-balanced soul.</p>
<p t="5473590" d="3049">Well, so the Egyptians figured all this out.</p>
<p t="5476639" d="7271">And then it’s even cooler than that, because
they used this idea of the union of Horus</p>
<p t="5483910" d="7959">and Osiris as their conceptual representation
of what gave the Pharaoh sovereignty.</p>
<p t="5491869" d="3671">Because again, like the Mesopotamians, they
were trying to figure out, well what should</p>
<p t="5495540" d="1000">rule?</p>
<p t="5496540" d="1960">What should be above all?</p>
<p t="5498500" d="3599">And the Mesopotamians figured, well it’s
something like Marduk, he’s got lots of</p>
<p t="5502099" d="2931">eyes, he can talk, he’s brave, he’ll conquer
the unknown.</p>
<p t="5505030" d="3730">As a consequence, he makes a pretty good top
god.</p>
<p t="5508760" d="7240">And the Egyptians added a level of sophistication
to that, because Horus is not only the thing</p>
<p t="5516000" d="4510">that will go into the Underworld, he goes
into the Underworld and he rescues things</p>
<p t="5520510" d="7919">of tremendous value and then unites with them,
so that not only can he see, but he’s wise.</p>
<p t="5528429" d="1911">And so then that’s what the Pharaoh is supposed
to be.</p>
<p t="5530340" d="4510">And the Egyptians basically characterised
that union as something akin to the immortal</p>
<p t="5534850" d="1000">soul.</p>
<p t="5535850" d="5100">Now, Eliade tracks this development, he called
it the ‘democratisation of Osiris’.</p>
<p t="5540950" d="6170">So first of all, basically only the Pharaoh
was allowed to be the Horus-Osiris union in</p>
<p t="5547120" d="1000">some sense.</p>
<p t="5548120" d="7349">And so in a way he was God on Earth, you know,
which is a conception of course that has lasted</p>
<p t="5555469" d="2121">into cultures for a very, very long period
of time.</p>
<p t="5557590" d="4279">And the Japanese still thought that way about
their emperor until the end of World War II.</p>
<p t="5561869" d="1500">Many of them still think that way.</p>
<p t="5563369" d="3080">So he was the embodiment of divine sovereignty.</p>
<p t="5566449" d="2721">It was in the leader only.</p>
<p t="5569170" d="6150">But as the Egyptian state developed, the idea
that that soul was an attribute started to</p>
<p t="5575320" d="1810">descend down the power hierarchy.</p>
<p t="5577130" d="3270">So after a while the aristocracy started to
use it.</p>
<p t="5580400" d="7960">And then, and this is a radical oversimplification,
but it’ll do for the purposes of this discussion,</p>
<p t="5588360" d="5810">you know by the time the Jews came along,
and they came out of Egypt (mythologically</p>
<p t="5594170" d="6040">speaking), the idea that there could be a
union or a relationship between something</p>
<p t="5600210" d="4110">that was divine and something that was individual
was distributed a long ways down the power</p>
<p t="5604320" d="1940">hierarchy.</p>
<p t="5606260" d="4050">And then by the time the Greeks showed up,
well in some sense it was all males, at least</p>
<p t="5610310" d="1639">all males who were part of the polity.</p>
<p t="5611949" d="4101">And when the Christians emerged, it was everyone.</p>
<p t="5616050" d="5820">Prostitutes, tax collectors, thieves, murderers,
everyone.</p>
<p t="5621870" d="4770">And so the idea of sovereignty started to
become, you know first of all it was a mythological</p>
<p t="5626640" d="4579">attribute, it was identified with the ruler,
but then it became a psychological attribute</p>
<p t="5631219" d="2411">that was distributed across the entire population.</p>
<p t="5633630" d="1320">It’s brilliant.</p>
<p t="5634950" d="1320">It’s brilliant!</p>
<p t="5636270" d="7360">And as far as I can tell, those conceptualisations
formed the sub-structure of our belief that</p>
<p t="5643630" d="4279">each person is divinely valuable, in their
own right.</p>
<p t="5647909" d="4621">That they have inalienable rights, even if
you’re a murderer, right, the state is very</p>
<p t="5652530" d="2180">restricted in what it can do to you.</p>
<p t="5654710" d="5909">Even if you committed a terrible crime, even
if you admit to it, the state is still very</p>
<p t="5660619" d="2401">restricted in what it’s allowed to do to
you.</p>
<p t="5663020" d="7570">Because there’s an idea that there’s something
about you that has the quality of transcendent</p>
<p t="5670590" d="1000">value.</p>
<p t="5671590" d="1000">That’s exactly it.</p>
<p t="5672590" d="2799">And well, we know some of the attributes.</p>
<p t="5675389" d="4661">One of them is you can see and pay attention
and another is that you can speak and communicate.</p>
<p t="5680050" d="6069">You know, the other is that you can become
wise, that you can approach things that frighten</p>
<p t="5686119" d="3681">you with courage, and generate new information
as a consequence.</p>
<p t="5689800" d="6129">Like there’s lots of things about you that
the relationship between Chaos and Order actually</p>
<p t="5695929" d="3111">literally depend upon.</p>
<p t="5699040" d="7409">And so the state has come to respect the individual
partly because the individual is, by necessity,</p>
<p t="5706449" d="2020">the thing that rejuvenates the state.</p>
<p t="5708469" d="2981">And so there’s this dynamic relationship
between the two.</p>
<p t="5711450" d="4510">The state structures you, but it’s old and
it’s blind, and there’s lots of things</p>
<p t="5715960" d="2619">it can’t see, and it’s partly corrupt.</p>
<p t="5718579" d="4511">Okay, but it’s hell of a lot better than
nothing, generally speaking, and so then you’re</p>
<p t="5723090" d="3989">like the forerunner of the state, and you
can pay attention.</p>
<p t="5727079" d="2980">Maybe you can see where things aren’t working
exactly right, where they’re not working</p>
<p t="5730059" d="2100">properly, and fix them.</p>
<p t="5732159" d="5931">And so then the state maintains its protective
structure across time and you exist in a dialectical</p>
<p t="5738090" d="1670">relationship with it.</p>
<p t="5739760" d="6879">You know, you see by the time the Christian
hero mythology emerges, Christ is more the</p>
<p t="5746639" d="5420">reconstructor of the state than he is the
thing that encounters chaos, right?</p>
<p t="5752059" d="6001">Because a huge chunk of the Christian story
is about the antagonism between him and his</p>
<p t="5758060" d="2260">culture and the Roman culture as well.</p>
<p t="5760320" d="7141">So the whole existential drama actually shifts
from hero as buttressing against nature, which</p>
<p t="5767461" d="5499">of course would have been the case earlier,
to hero as thing that decomposes and reconstructs</p>
<p t="5772960" d="2159">culture in a radical way.</p>
<p t="5775119" d="6181">So you know, Moses does the same thing, and
Moses is a master of water, he’s a transformative</p>
<p t="5781300" d="5279">agent, so it’s an indication of exactly
the same sort of idea.</p>
<p t="5786579" d="7140">That’s a good time for a break.</p>
