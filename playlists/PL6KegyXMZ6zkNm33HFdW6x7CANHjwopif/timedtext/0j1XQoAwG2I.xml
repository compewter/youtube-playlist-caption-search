<p t="10420" d="2239">So I&#39;m going to talk to you today about</p>
<p t="13330" d="2000">a different way of looking at</p>
<p t="15699" d="1771">what real is.</p>
<p t="17470" d="3979">It&#39;s not easy to figure out what real is because we don&#39;t really have infinite knowledge</p>
<p t="21449" d="4110">and so we&#39;re always making some sets of presuppositions about what&#39;s most real</p>
<p t="26230" d="1860">And it really matters what</p>
<p t="28090" d="1980">you assume is most real because</p>
<p t="30070" d="6860">you base the decisions that you make that run the entire course of your life on those assumptions whether you recognize it or not,</p>
<p t="37240" d="2000">and if you get the assumptions wrong</p>
<p t="40020" d="5360">or even if you leave them incomplete, you&#39;re going to pay a big price for it</p>
<p t="46200" d="1600">and</p>
<p t="48160" d="2209">the assumptions that we use in our culture,</p>
<p t="51250" d="5119">although they&#39;ve enabled us to develop a tremendously potent technology</p>
<p t="56600" d="3999">are incomplete in ways that have also cost us, and that are extremely dangerous.</p>
<p t="61930" d="2659">Since the Scientific Age began,</p>
<p t="65500" d="2000">we&#39;ve lived in a universe</p>
<p t="67900" d="1530">where</p>
<p t="69430" d="1830">the bottom</p>
<p t="71260" d="4339">strata of reality is considered to be something, that&#39;s dead</p>
<p t="76119" d="1021">like</p>
<p t="77140" d="2839">dirt, it&#39;s like it&#39;s matter, it&#39;s</p>
<p t="80650" d="2000">objective, it&#39;s</p>
<p t="84040" d="2000">external and</p>
<p t="86470" d="5269">there isn&#39;t any element of it that lends any reality</p>
<p t="92000" d="1189">to</p>
<p t="93189" d="2030">phenomena like meaning or purpose.</p>
<p t="96040" d="4219">That&#39;s all being relegated to the subjective and in some ways to the illusory</p>
<p t="101320" d="1290">but</p>
<p t="102610" d="4909">It&#39;s by no means self-evident that that set of presuppositions is correct,</p>
<p t="108520" d="2000">because we lack</p>
<p t="111070" d="5360">Infinite knowledge, and there&#39;s many things about the structure of being that we don&#39;t understand, the main one being</p>
<p t="116500" d="7849">consciousness, we can&#39;t account for it at all and we can&#39;t account for the role it appears to play in the transformation of potential into</p>
<p t="124350" d="970">actuality</p>
<p t="125320" d="5120">which is a role that&#39;s been recognized by physicists for almost a hundred years now</p>
<p t="130440" d="1150">and</p>
<p t="131590" d="2910">which remains one of the biggest unsolved mystery in science.</p>
<p t="135700" d="2480">There are other ways of looking at what&#39;s real</p>
<p t="138800" d="3020">And these other ways have some advantages and one of the advantages that</p>
<p t="141820" d="3320">they have is that they protect us knowing these other ways of</p>
<p t="145610" d="5239">operating within reality defining reality protect us from certain kinds of Pathologies and modern people are prone to</p>
<p t="151400" d="5000">a fair number of pathologies that stem from the assumptions of their,</p>
<p t="156739" d="7639">of the systems they use to define reality and one of those pathologies is a kind of a nihilistic hopelessness which is a</p>
<p t="164510" d="2000">consequence of the recognition that,</p>
<p t="166549" d="3680">in the final analysis nothing really has any meaning</p>
<p t="170800" d="3569">And because life is difficult, and that&#39;s a meaning that you can&#39;t escape</p>
<p t="176120" d="5959">Being forced to abandon your belief in a positive or a transcendent meaning can leave you weak the times when you really</p>
<p t="182389" d="2000">can least afford to be weak</p>
<p t="184400" d="6109">And there&#39;s more important pathologies that it&#39;s opened us up to too and those are pathologies of belief, and I think we saw the most</p>
<p t="191389" d="7790">Horrifying examples of that hopefully the most horrifying examples in the 20th century where people whose belief systems were shattered at least in part</p>
<p t="199180" d="5040">by the competition between religious and scientific Viewpoints turned in large numbers</p>
<p t="204530" d="7250">to mass movements that were in error in every way as substitute ,a more rational in some sense substitute for</p>
<p t="212389" d="5360">Religious beliefs that appeared no longer tenable and the consequence of that was it was just about annihilation</p>
<p t="218780" d="7519">Because we came close to annihilation twice once in the 60s and once in the 80s and even without the totality of annihilation</p>
<p t="227030" d="2929">we lost hundreds of millions of people as a consequence</p>
<p t="230540" d="3860">of pathological belief systems in the 20th century, so</p>
<p t="234979" d="2030">if belief systems become pathological</p>
<p t="237500" d="7519">they put that Pathology can pose the biggest threat possibly to our very existence and if you&#39;re a Darwinian in any sense</p>
<p t="245569" d="5089">You have to understand that the things that pose the biggest threats to your survival are the most real things</p>
<p t="251569" d="2000">and they have to be dealt with.</p>
<p t="254239" d="2179">Now here&#39;s another way of looking at things,</p>
<p t="258169" d="4970">I&#39;ll start with the definition of this word, this word phainesthai is the root word of phenomena</p>
<p t="263810" d="5929">phenomenon and phenomena are the things that appear to you, and phainesthai means to Shine forth and</p>
<p t="269990" d="5540">the phenomenologists who were interested in the shining forth of things made the presumption that the things that</p>
<p t="275689" d="3350">Manifested themselves to you as most meaningful were the most real things</p>
<p t="279039" d="5850">And I think you can make a strong case that that&#39;s actually how your brain is wired because your brain is wired to react to</p>
<p t="284889" d="7170">things that have meaning before they construct the perceptions that you think of as objects and the reason for that is because</p>
<p t="292460" d="3229">The meaning of things is more real in some sense</p>
<p t="295689" d="4410">But more important than the view of things as objects and so for example a famous</p>
<p t="301279" d="1621">Philosopher</p>
<p t="302900" d="6799">psychologists division said that when you approach a cliff you don&#39;t see a cliff you see a falling off place it</p>
<p t="310580" d="5089">isn&#39;t that it&#39;s an object cliff to which you attribute the meaning of falling off place -</p>
<p t="316460" d="7940">It&#39;s the falling off place perception comes first and the abstraction of the object of cliff, if it ever happens at all comes much later</p>
<p t="324529" d="4640">Much later conceptually because even babies can detect cliffs and much later historically</p>
<p t="330740" d="3859">Poets have noticed this phenomena shining forth</p>
<p t="336229" d="4070">Reality and they&#39;ve often associated it with childhood, and I think there&#39;s good reasons for that. I think</p>
<p t="341089" d="4700">Your brain is not so much of an inhibitory structure when you&#39;re a child before. It&#39;s fully developed and</p>
<p t="347930" d="3109">So there&#39;s there&#39;s neurological reasons for noting it, but there&#39;s also</p>
<p t="352099" d="4429">reasons that stem from the level of lived experience, you can tell when you&#39;re around children that they&#39;re</p>
<p t="356599" d="4010">open to things in a way that adults aren&#39;t they&#39;re wide eyed with wonder and</p>
<p t="362060" d="5929">Adults like being around children for that reason because although the child takes an awful Lot [of] care and is a</p>
<p t="368870" d="4159">Terrifying object in some ways to behold if you have a relationship with the child because they&#39;re so vulnerable</p>
<p t="373370" d="4669">The part of the way they pay you back is they open up your eyes</p>
<p t="378589" d="2000">your eyes that have been closed by your</p>
<p t="380659" d="6440">Experience and that have learned to shield out the things that shine forth and when you have a child you can look through the child&#39;s</p>
<p t="387099" d="2970">Eyes again, and to me, it&#39;s like they&#39;re on fire in a sense</p>
<p t="390069" d="5190">They&#39;re like a candle or something that&#39;s burning brightly, and I think that&#39;s also partly because we actually don&#39;t screen out fire</p>
<p t="395259" d="3509">We actually see fire, and that&#39;s why we can&#39;t not look at it when it&#39;s around</p>
<p t="398769" d="4809">I think the same thing happens when you&#39;re in love with someone if it&#39;s</p>
<p t="404219" d="7220">If it&#39;s genuine love because genuine love gives you a hint of what could be in the future if you could just set yourself</p>
<p t="411439" d="3420">Right you get a glimpse of what could be in the future if you fall in love with someone</p>
<p t="414989" d="3020">You don&#39;t get that without work, but you get a glimpse of it</p>
<p t="418009" d="2100">And I think it&#39;s because when you fall in love</p>
<p t="420110" d="2000">And I believe this is likely a biochemical</p>
<p t="422369" d="6890">Transformation is the perceptual structures that normally stop you from seeing people because you really don&#39;t see people you just see shadows</p>
<p t="429899" d="2000">they did that the</p>
<p t="433019" d="4040">Barriers are lifted temporarily, and what&#39;s really there Shines through and it&#39;s overwhelming</p>
<p t="437789" d="2000">But to stay in that state</p>
<p t="440189" d="2449">well it requires a tremendous amount of</p>
<p t="443489" d="2930">Moral effort is really the right way of thinking about it</p>
<p t="447329" d="2000">Wordsworth Said about children</p>
<p t="449399" d="7220">There was a time when meadow grove and stream the earth and every common sight to me did seem apparelled in celestial light</p>
<p t="457529" d="7160">The Glory and the Freshness of a dream it is not now as it hath been of your turn where so ever I may</p>
<p t="464879" d="1620">by night or day</p>
<p t="466499" d="3079">The things which I have seen I now can see no more</p>
<p t="470849" d="1020">Earth</p>
<p t="471869" d="2809">Fills her lap with pleasures of her own yearnings</p>
<p t="474679" d="6000">She hath in her own natural kind and even with something of a mother&#39;s mind, [and] no unworthy Aim</p>
<p t="481349" d="7160">The homely nurse doth all she can to [make] her foster child her inmate man forget the glories he hath known and that</p>
<p t="489089" d="5869">Imperial parents palace whence he came and what woodsworth means by this is [that] as?</p>
<p t="495299" d="5089">you develop as an as a competent adult which which is precisely the</p>
<p t="501119" d="4040">Direction towards which you should develop much of what you&#39;re doing is actually</p>
<p t="505499" d="7189">closing in and narrowing you&#39;re closing in and narrowing towards a particular goal in a particular way of being and that&#39;s necessary because as</p>
<p t="513360" d="1289">you</p>
<p t="514649" d="5600">Develop you have to develop towards a particular way of being or you don&#39;t develop at all and you can&#39;t stay a child forever</p>
<p t="521579" d="2989">that goes that [goes] sour of its own accord and</p>
<p t="525329" d="7910">So human beings are destined to close their perceptions in to sharpen themselves and to focus on very little so that they can at least</p>
<p t="533370" d="1820">do that</p>
<p t="535190" d="3440">But the price we pay for that is that we start to replace the relationship?</p>
<p t="538630" d="580">we have with</p>
<p t="539210" d="7820">untrammeled reality with the shadows that are only complex enough to let us do what we need to do and no more and</p>
<p t="547610" d="5599">In some sense although we become more competent in other ways we&#39;ve become more blind and we kind of know how this happens</p>
<p t="553970" d="6200">That happens from the bottom up now. This is a magritte painting and the painting has an obvious meaning in a sense</p>
<p t="560170" d="2000">Which is that, we&#39;re blinded</p>
<p t="562490" d="5539">Even to what&#39;s right in front [of] us by the objects that we [see] and we think that seeing is</p>
<p t="570470" d="5630">letting in the light, but it&#39;s only letting in a very small fraction of the light because we&#39;re only capable of</p>
<p t="576800" d="3469">Contemplating a small fraction of everything whenever we&#39;re doing any particular</p>
<p t="580400" d="5960">thing and so very much of what we&#39;re doing is screening things out very [much] of your Cortex is inhibitory and</p>
<p t="587810" d="4549">Magritte is trying to get at [that] with that idea. It&#39;s like. There&#39;s a businessman there. He&#39;s dressed in his uniform</p>
<p t="592360" d="2000">He can&#39;t see Beyond the immediate</p>
<p t="594830" d="2900">The immediate thing that&#39;s in front of his eyes. How does that happen well?</p>
<p t="597730" d="2700">Let&#39;s say you&#39;re a baby the first thing you learn you learn</p>
<p t="600680" d="2390">you build your body from the bottom up you build your</p>
<p t="603170" d="5510">Perceptual and action structures from the bottom up you learn to move your arm. You learn to close your hand</p>
<p t="609350" d="6080">Then you learn to do things that are practical with those abilities you lift a spoon [well] you have to do that to feed yourself</p>
<p t="615620" d="3289">You learn to move a plate [you] [learn] to set the table?</p>
<p t="618910" d="4380">That&#39;s starting to become social now because you can set the table for you [and] for other people [you]</p>
<p t="624020" d="6290">[learn] to make a meal that&#39;s a more complex sequencing of motor activities and perceptual abilities. That&#39;s very focused as</p>
<p t="631940" d="4699">you continue to develop the things you chain together become more and more complex and and</p>
<p t="637010" d="5300">But also more specific you you have to care for your family which means there&#39;s all sorts of other things. You&#39;re not doing</p>
<p t="642650" d="1520">You have to find a good job</p>
<p t="644170" d="6989">Which almost everyone when they&#39;re young experiences as the contemplation of a limitation well not everyone, but many people think oh, no</p>
<p t="651160" d="3929">You know I&#39;m going to have to settle for this role</p>
<p t="655090" d="1500">I don&#39;t want to only be that role</p>
<p t="656590" d="2940">but it&#39;s better to be that role that no role at all and</p>
<p t="659960" d="4610">Maybe the way through the role to the other side is through the role not around it</p>
<p t="664670" d="6669">There&#39;s no avoiding the responsibilities of narrow and shaping and specializing be a good parent [well]</p>
<p t="671339" d="2099">That&#39;s a sacrifice you make for the next generation</p>
<p t="674230" d="2779">Be a good partner the same thing</p>
<p t="680769" d="4460">be a good citizen it&#39;s easy for young people in particular to be skeptical of that because</p>
<p t="685509" d="7070">the old Society is always corrupt and archaic and blind and to become a member of that seems to be in part to</p>
<p t="693249" d="2420">To allow yourself to adopt that same aged</p>
<p t="696279" d="1021">blindness</p>
<p t="697300" d="3589">But that thing also educates you it shapes every word you speak?</p>
<p t="701379" d="5000">it&#39;s something that you have to be grateful to even in its aged and archaic form and</p>
<p t="707050" d="5209">It&#39;s part of the necessities of human responsibility that you become a good citizen and that</p>
<p t="713499" d="2720">Means in some sense giving up more [of] what could be</p>
<p t="716980" d="2149">at least to sustain, what is</p>
<p t="721660" d="7460">there is a satirical song from the late 1890s English. I am the very model of a modern major-general of</p>
<p t="729670" d="1529">information vegetable animal</p>
<p t="731199" d="7100">And mineral I know the kings of England and I quote the fights historical from Marathon to Waterloo in order</p>
<p t="738519" d="4730">Categorical and the satire is well. He has the knowledge. He&#39;s an official</p>
<p t="744970" d="1469">functionary and</p>
<p t="746439" d="5630">It&#39;s very difficult to do [that], but in the same way, it&#39;s very limited in categorical and of course an artist would object to [that]</p>
<p t="754540" d="2299">But it&#39;s better than nothing at all and that&#39;s the alternative</p>
<p t="759069" d="770">Well above that</p>
<p t="759839" d="5549">Maybe what&#39;s above good citizen because sometimes good citizen is [not] so good if you were a good citizen of Nazi Germany are a good</p>
<p t="765389" d="2000">citizen of the soviet Union, or of mao&#39;s China</p>
<p t="767889" d="2570">you know you were narrowed in a particular way, [but] and</p>
<p t="771579" d="3349">Then maybe in a necessary way, but also in a very pathological way</p>
<p t="774929" d="4080">And so it seems to be that there has to be something even though</p>
<p t="779379" d="5780">Adopting that restricted Viewpoint is necessary there has to be something above it, and I think that&#39;s also the thing [that] can restore</p>
<p t="785709" d="2000">The sense you have of a true</p>
<p t="788319" d="5929">Entanglement with the the deepest and most meaningful realities of life, and that&#39;s the issue of being a good person</p>
<p t="794290" d="2630">It&#39;s above being a citizen it&#39;s something else</p>
<p t="796920" d="1930">It has something to do with the development of individuality</p>
<p t="798850" d="6470">And I think we&#39;re [also] wired for the so it looks like we&#39;re wired to lose what we had to specialize</p>
<p t="805320" d="6419">But then once we&#39;re specialized to reopen but once we&#39;ve got the skills built into our body and then can hand handle reality</p>
<p t="812230" d="5119">Because we&#39;re more adapted and more fluid and more flexible then we can start opening the doors again</p>
<p t="817350" d="3180">And I and I believe that your nervous system is setup</p>
<p t="820630" d="6890">To help you do that if [you] don&#39;t interfere with it if you notice and you notice that by paying attention to the things that</p>
<p t="828190" d="4460">manifest themselves to you that shine forth as interesting they grab you and</p>
<p t="833440" d="2479">where you&#39;re grabbed is where the</p>
<p t="836440" d="4340">Obscuring map you live in isn&#39;t obscuring the reality. That&#39;s underneath</p>
<p t="840780" d="2000">it&#39;s like there&#39;s a hole in the map and</p>
<p t="842800" d="4070">The light Shines through that and you&#39;re attracted to that and that will pull you along</p>
<p t="846870" d="4799">And that&#39;s when your interest is seized by something. That&#39;s your nervous system doing that you don&#39;t do that</p>
<p t="851800" d="2000">It&#39;s it&#39;s an unconscious Force</p>
<p t="853800" d="6989">You could even say it was the world itself talking to you and the phenomenologist didn&#39;t feel that way and it&#39;s a real phenomena</p>
<p t="860790" d="3720">It&#39;s not a secondary thing and you know that because you can&#39;t live without it</p>
<p t="864820" d="3559">You die is stultify you get cynical you get nihilistic</p>
<p t="868380" d="5489">Or you adopt some wild belief system. If you don&#39;t have the attachment to some genuine</p>
<p t="874990" d="6229">Life-giving meaning in your own life, and it&#39;s a hard [thing] to follow that because it doesn&#39;t necessarily put you into perfect</p>
<p t="882550" d="5119">Juxtaposition with society because it&#39;s not society it&#39;s not being a good citizen. It&#39;s something else. It&#39;s [also] the thing [that]</p>
<p t="888400" d="2000">Rebuilds how you would be a good citizen?</p>
<p t="893050" d="3410">The egyptians knew about this a long time ago. They didn&#39;t really know they knew</p>
<p t="897700" d="2809">Because they acted things out in drama and portrayed them</p>
<p t="901030" d="6079">mythologically because they didn&#39;t have the capacity to articulate the ideas fully, but the egyptians worshiped the human eye and</p>
<p t="907630" d="6229">They worshiped the eye because they knew the eye was the thing that paid attention like we&#39;re really visual creatures and your eye is automatically</p>
