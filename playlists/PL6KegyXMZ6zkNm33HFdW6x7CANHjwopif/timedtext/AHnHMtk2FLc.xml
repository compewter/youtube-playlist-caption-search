<p t="4160" d="3700">So, I have a plan I'd like to talk to you about.</p>
<p t="7980" d="4460">I presume that most of you watching this video are subscribers and</p>
<p t="12540" d="4760">are interested in the content of this channel. I'd like to improve it.</p>
<p t="17580" d="4560">There are some features of the videos, especially the class lectures, that I'm not happy about</p>
<p t="22240" d="3680">and I presume you're not all that happy about them either.</p>
<p t="26580" d="3680">Most importantly I think they lack the proper images</p>
<p t="33040" d="5180">But there are also segments of the videos that are only relevant to an in-class audience,</p>
<p t="38320" d="3760">so, information about tests and so on. And there's parts of them that are inaudible</p>
<p t="42140" d="2980">or where the digressions aren't exactly appropriate</p>
<p t="45340" d="5240">and, as well, there are lectures across years that pertain to the same theme</p>
<p t="50700" d="5820">that should be unified in some manners so that they're as intelligible and tight as they could be.</p>
<p t="57860" d="6440">I'd also like to make transcripts available to people and it would be good if the lectures were subtitled</p>
<p t="64320" d="4540">the transcriptions would help with that. And then maybe they can also be translated.</p>
<p t="69120" d="3860">I have some volunteers who are already working on that.</p>
<p t="74180" d="5040">So I set up a page for this channel on a site called Patreon.</p>
<p t="80060" d="6280">Patreon allows people who are interested in the contents of say a YouTube channel like this one...</p>
<p t="87780" d="4640">to help in the further development of the projects that are posted there.</p>
<p t="93100" d="5540">So... if you're interested in doing that and you'd like to see the sorts of things that I just described,</p>
<p t="98680" d="5060">then... you could click and subscribe and maybe that would be good</p>
<p t="104300" d="3420">So... that's the plan</p>
